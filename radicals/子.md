# <bigfont> 子</bigfont> - Child 

Previous kanji: [夕](夕.md) Next kanji: [小](小.md) 

## Meanings
 Child
## Mnemonics
 * This radical is made up of two barbs and one ground radical. If there are barbs on the ground, whom (especially) do you want to avoid that area? You want your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> child</span> to avoid it, since children are so careless and often don't wear shoes. Imagine how bad you'd feel if you let a child walk around on top of these barbs! Pretty bad, I imagine.
