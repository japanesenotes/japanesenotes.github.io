## Meanings
 Pig
## Mnemonics
 * You have the animal radical in this already, that should be a clue. What kind of animal is it? It's in the ground, covered in mud. Also, there are toes laying around with it, because this animal will eat anything (good way to get rid of bodies... I hear). So what's this animal that's covered in mud and eats toes because it will eat anything? It's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> pig</span>!
