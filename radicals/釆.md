# <bigfont> 釆</bigfont> - Sickle 

Previous kanji: [罒](罒.md) Next kanji: [馬](馬.md) 

## Meanings
 Sickle
## Mnemonics
 * Most of this radical is just the rice radical, but the top part is something coming to cut the rice from its stalk. That, my friend, is the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sickle</span>. See how the rice is still there? That's because it's in motion. The sickle is literally doing the cutting RIGHT NOW! (And don't confuse this with the grain <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [禾](https://jisho.org/search/禾)</span> radical!)
