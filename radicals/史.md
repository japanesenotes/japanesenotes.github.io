# <bigfont> 史</bigfont> - History 

Previous kanji: [介](介.md) Next kanji: [癶](癶.md) 

## Meanings
 History
## Mnemonics
 * A mouth that's talking about treasure... that sounds more like ancient <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> history</span> to me. Just because there was treasure buried all over the place back in history, doesn't mean it wasn't found by now. Don't let history take over your life, like it has the person who owns this mouth.
