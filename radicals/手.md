Previous kanji: [天](天.md) Next kanji: [文](文.md) 

## Meanings
 Hand
## Mnemonics
 * This one's a little tough to picture, but I believe in you. The barb in the middle is the wrist/arm. Then, there are four regular fingers coming off of it and then one big thumb (the slide radical at the top). So you have four fingers, a thumb, and a wrist. This is what makes up your crazy looking <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hand</span>.
