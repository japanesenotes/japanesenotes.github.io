Previous kanji: [工](工.md) Next kanji: [丁](丁.md) 

## Meanings
 Narwhal
## Mnemonics
 * This radical looks like the katakana character <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ナ](https://jisho.org/search/ナ)</span> (na), which we're going to say stands for <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> narwhal</span>. Plus, this radical kind of looks like a narwhal, right? The body and head on the bottom, and the single majestic narwhal horn coming out the top, shooting up out of the water and into the air. Oh, and don't confuse this radical with treasure. The sideways line for narwhal (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ナ](https://jisho.org/search/ナ)</span>) is horizontal, the sideways line for treasure is at more of a downward angle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [メ](https://jisho.org/search/メ)</span>), like an X.
