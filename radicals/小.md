Previous kanji: [子](子.md) Next kanji: [弓](弓.md) 

## Meanings
 Small
## Mnemonics
 * You have fins and you have a barb. A fish that you can stick an entire barb through like this would have to be really <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> small</span>, since it's sticking through the whole fish body (which you can imagine by basing the body off the size of the fins compared to the already small barb.)
