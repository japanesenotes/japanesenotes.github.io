## Meanings
 Kiss
## Mnemonics
 * When you combine winter and mouth you get... winter mouth! Or at least a mouth that tastes like winter because it's coming in for a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> kiss</span>. Before you go kissing people you eat mints, right? It's common courtesy so you don't give them a mouth full of bad breath. So when you think of a winter mouth, think of a nice, minty kiss!
