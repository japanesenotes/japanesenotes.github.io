# <bigfont> 巳</bigfont> - Snake 

Previous kanji: [ユ](ユ.md) Next kanji: [云](云.md) 

## Meanings
 Snake
## Mnemonics
 * There's two ways to remember this one. First, you could look at this and see it's a coiled up <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> snake</span>. Or, if you want, you can imagine it as a snake head, with its face facing to the right (see its open mouth?). We may use either when learning a kanji, but for now you can pick the one that fits best with your memorization style. Just make sure you get to snake when you see this radical.<br />*Also note that sometimes the coil isn't totally completed (where it connects in the middle of the vertical line).
