# <bigfont> 云</bigfont> - Cloud 

Previous kanji: [巳](巳.md) Next kanji: [殳](殳.md) 

## Meanings
 Cloud
## Mnemonics
 * This is the radical for <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cloud</span>. See how the cloud is puffy on the bottom but has two lines up top? That's because a plane flew through it. If humans didn't invent planes, this cloud radical might look different. Really makes you think, huh?
