 * Under the hat there are two people <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> meet</span>ing in private. Look at them huddled up in there. They must have a reason to want to meet in such a private place, but that's not for you to judge. Maybe next time you have to meet with someone you'll hide under a hat with them too.
