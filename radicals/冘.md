## Meanings
 Pirate
## Mnemonics
 * This kind of looks like big (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [大](https://jisho.org/search/大)</span>), which I think you'll remember you learned by pretending this was a big guy. This big guy, however, has a funny leg... a peg leg. That makes him a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> pirate</span>. Also, his arms are in the YARRRR position.
