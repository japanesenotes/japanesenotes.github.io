# <bigfont> 人</bigfont> - Person 

Previous kanji: [亠](亠.md) Next kanji: [ト](ト.md) 

## Meanings
 Person
## Mnemonics
 * If you were to draw a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> person</span> with just strokes like you see in kanji, you'd create a stick figure, maybe something like this: <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [大](https://jisho.org/search/大)</span>. But this is just a person, not someone holding out their arms to show how big they are. So their arms are down, which makes them look like a torso with a pair of legs. Maybe they're walking too, which is why their legs are spread out like that. You can see the person now, can't you?
