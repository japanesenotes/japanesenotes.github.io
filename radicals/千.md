## Meanings
 Thousand
## Mnemonics
 * You're in a room, surrounded by slides. Down off the slides tumble cross after cross after cross. They're bouncing in and hitting you in the face, the arm, everywhere... With each cross comes a voice yelling, ONE! TWO! THREE HUNDRED! FIVE HUNDRED! and so on. You are worried it will never end, because you're starting to drown in the crosses. Then the voice yells out ONE <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> THOUSAND</span> and they stop. Still, you can't move. Think about all the numbers being called out, and keep wondering if it'll be the last one. Feel the relief you'd feel if it stops on a thousand, because you won't be buried anymore. The thousand crosses are covering you entirely, over your head, but because they're crosses you can still breathe.
