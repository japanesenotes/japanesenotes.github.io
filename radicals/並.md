 Line Up
## Mnemonics
 * <div>You stick&nbsp;horns&nbsp;in the&nbsp;ground&nbsp;using them as&nbsp;spikes&nbsp;and you&nbsp;line up&nbsp;the horns in a straight line. Horns are pretty much the same thing as spikes once you stick them in the ground, and you line these ones up precisely for optimal protection.</div><h3><i></i>&nbsp;HINTS</h3><div>Imagine yourself lining up these horns in the ground. The spikes are sharp and you poke yourself with one. Ouch. Need to be more careful as you line these up.</div>
