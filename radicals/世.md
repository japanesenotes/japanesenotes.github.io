## Meanings
 World
## Mnemonics
 * There are no circles in kanji, remember? So imagine that these angles are really circles. A little circle in a big circle, with a line running through them. Why, it's the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> world</span>. The world looks just like this, with continents on the globe and a line is the equator. Can you see it?


## Kanjis
 * [世](../kanjis/世.md), (World, Generation)
* [葉](../kanjis/葉.md), (Leaf, Leaves)
* [蝶](../kanjis/蝶.md), (Butterfly)
