 * Who wears cleats and takes your measurements for so long that icicles start forming on your body? Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> commander</span>. The commander is very, very particular. And everyone knows the commander has to get everything exactly right. So taking your measurements takes SO long that icicles grow out of your nose. But that's okay. You have to impress your new commander, darn it!
