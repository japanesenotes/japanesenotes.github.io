Previous kanji: [発](発.md) Next kanji: [南](南.md) 

## Meanings
 Sweet
## Mnemonics
 * This radical is the sun with its hair sticking out. Why is the sun's hair sticking out like this? It ate wayyy too many <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sweet</span> things causing it to have too much energy, making its hair stand on end. It also kind of looks like a sweet, sweet candy with the wrapper sticking out. Remember it how you'd like.
