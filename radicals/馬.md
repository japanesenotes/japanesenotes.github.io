## Meanings
 Horse
## Mnemonics
 * Don't confuse this radical with the bird <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [鳥](https://jisho.org/search/鳥)</span> radical. It looks similar, with the wing on the bottom and the shape on top, but it doesn't have a feather sticking out of the top of its head and it has a long, thick neck. So while it moves fast like it has wings, it's no bird, it's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horse</span>.
