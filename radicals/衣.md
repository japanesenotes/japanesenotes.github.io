## Meanings
 Clothes
## Mnemonics
 * You kick a lid off a box. Inside the box is a bunch of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> clothes</span>. This radical will be the same as the kanji you'll learn later on, so it's helpful to learn it as clothes even though it doesn't quite look like clothes.
