Previous kanji: [周](周.md) Next kanji: [开](开.md) 

## Meanings
 Hole
## Mnemonics
 * You have a roof on top of what looks like a volcano. What is the roof covering on the top of the volcano? Why, it's definitely covering the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hole</span> at the top. I guess someone thought if they built a roof on the volcano hole, none of the lava could come out.
