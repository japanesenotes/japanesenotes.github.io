## Meanings
 Blood
## Mnemonics
 * There's a little speck of something on your plate (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [皿](https://jisho.org/search/皿)</span>). What is that? you ask. Oh no... that speck is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> BLOOD</span>!!! I hope it's blood from a nosebleed you suddenly have and not someone else's blood. (Your waiter is probably gonna get fired, btw.) At least your platelets should stop the bleeding soon. Haha, get it? PLATE-lets? Japanese blood jokes.
