## Meanings
 Clan
## Mnemonics
 * This looks like a little tamagotchi or (if you aren't a 90s kid) a duck. What do both of these critters have in common? They have really crazy <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> clan</span> followings. And the people who enjoy them (tiny pocket games or watching quacking duckies) create clans that get together and share their experiences. Which clan are you a part of?
