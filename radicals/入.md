 * Watch out! This isn't the person radical, it's something else. What's the difference? The right side is longer than the left side. And on computers, it usually has that extra part sticking out of the top. It kind of looks like a flap opening to a teepee. And what do you do with an opening? You enter it! That's why this radical is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> enter</span>.
