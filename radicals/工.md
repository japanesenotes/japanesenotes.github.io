Previous kanji: [刀](刀.md) Next kanji: [ナ](ナ.md) 

## Meanings
 Construction
## Mnemonics
 * You know those big steel girders that are used for the frame of big buildings? This is like the end of one of those, and have a very distinct shape, just like this radical. These girders are used in construction, which is why this radical means <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> construction</span>. Funny thing is, you use these girders to put together buildings just like you're going to use this radical to put together kanji!
