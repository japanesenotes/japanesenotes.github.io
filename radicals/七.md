 * What does this radical look like? Hmm, nothing much. What about if you turn it upside down? Now does it look like a 7 with a line through it? Close enough to help you to remember that this radical is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> seven</span>, right? Just remember, when you see this radical, flip it over and see what number it looks like. If you can do that, you can remember the meaning!
