## Meanings
 Lantern
## Mnemonics
 * Think of an old-style <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lantern</span>. It's on top of a few legs (you can only see two from this angle) and it's in a box shaped holder at the top. You can imagine these lining the streets before electricity, right? That's why this radical is a lantern.
