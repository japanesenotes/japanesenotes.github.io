## Meanings
 Death
## Mnemonics
 * There's a lid on a lion. And you're stuck under the lid with the lion, which means you will surely meet your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> death</span>. Or if you don't want to die, think of the poor lion. If you leave a lion under a lid for too long, death will come for it too. Either way, somebody's gonna die today.
