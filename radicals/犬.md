## Meanings
 Dog
## Mnemonics
 * Remember the big guy that helped you remember the big radical? Now the big guy has something on his shoulder... what is that? You look and see that he has a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dog</span> up there, perched as if it were a parrot or a cat or something. Dogs aren't supposed to be up on people's shoulders like that, but for him? It works!
