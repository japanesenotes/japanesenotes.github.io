 * Sticking a&nbsp;cross&nbsp;into a&nbsp;rice paddy&nbsp;to get its&nbsp;measurements is your&nbsp;specialty. Most people get really confused when they have to measure their rice paddies, but that's where you come in. You plant a cross right in the middle, look down it from one end to the other, and voila! You know the measurements immediately. That's why it's your specialty!
