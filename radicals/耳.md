## Meanings
 Ear
## Mnemonics
 * This radical is a bit more elaborate than the eye, though similar. In fact, if you go blind, your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ear</span>s become one of your new senses of sight, which is why this is like another, somewhat modified, eye. You'll even notice little lines sticking out of the eye. That's because ears stick out more than eyes (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [目](https://jisho.org/search/目)</span>), which is why this radical is the ear radical.
