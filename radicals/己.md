# <bigfont> 己</bigfont> - Oneself 

Previous kanji: [品](品.md) Next kanji: [正](正.md) 

## Meanings
 Oneself
## Mnemonics
 * This looks a bit like a backwards S. S for Self. But it's backwards because you didn't want to mix yourself up with any of the other selves out there, so you flipped it. That's why it means <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> oneself</span>. (That's you!)<br />This radical will appear as things like yourself, herself, etc., so keep that in mind!
