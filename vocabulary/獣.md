## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember: <br />A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beast</span>... what do you think of when you think of a beast? How about a thing (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [物](https://jisho.org/search/物)</span>, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もの](https://jisho.org/search/もの)</span>) full of fur (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [毛](https://jisho.org/search/毛)</span>, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [け](https://jisho.org/search/け)</span>), aka a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [け](https://jisho.org/search/け)もの</span> (fur thing)? A beast is a fur thing, and in Japanese that's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [け](https://jisho.org/search/け)もの</span>. Punnnns.
