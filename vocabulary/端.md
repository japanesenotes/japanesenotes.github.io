## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This refers to a literal edge, not a figurative one.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: <br />If you're on <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> edge</span>, just eat some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hash</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はし](https://jisho.org/search/はし)</span>) browns to feel better! And if you're going to the edge of the world, hash browns will probably help you make it there too. Hash browns are so useful!
