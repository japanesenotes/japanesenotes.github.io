## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ugly</span>? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ugly</span> still!
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />The most <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ugly</span> thing you've ever seen was a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mini coo</span>kie (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みにく](https://jisho.org/search/みにく)</span>). Why would any one want a tiny cookie? Cookies should be huge, and enough to fill you up. The more you look at the mini cookie it seems to become uglier and uglier to you.
