* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Look to</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> time</span> to see how much longer this will last. It's not forever, it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> temporary</span>, which is why we must look to time to figure out how much longer it'll be around.
