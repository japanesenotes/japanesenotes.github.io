## Mnemonics:
テレビを点けてもらえますか。
* Can you turn on the TV?
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> point</span> so the verb version is something you need to point your finger to do. Picture pointing your finger and pushing a lightswitch <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to turn on</span> the light. You won't be able <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to switch on</span> a lamp if you can't point your finger.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You aren't able <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to turn on</span> the light with just one finger though, you need to use <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>). Either you have really weak fingers, or that's a really strong lightswitch. Either way, you need two fingers to switch on the light.
