## Mnemonics:
コウイチは猫舌なので、スープをふうふうしないと食べられません。本当でしょうか嘘でしょうか？
* Koichi doesn’t like hot food, so he can’t eat soup without blowing on it. Is this true or false?
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cat</span>'s <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tongue</span> is for some reason associated with an aversion to hot foods. I guess I haven't seen a cat drinking up boiling milk, but whatever. Just imagine a cat licking up something super hot and freaking out. Cats don't like hot things, which is why this is an aversion to hot foods.
* The reading is the two vocab words separately put together, just as you'd expect from a body-part related kanji. So, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [猫](https://jisho.org/search/猫)</span> plus <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [舌](https://jisho.org/search/舌)</span> = <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ねこじた</span>. Just remember that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [舌](https://jisho.org/search/舌)</span> is read here as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じた](https://jisho.org/search/じた)</span>, and not <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [した](https://jisho.org/search/した)</span>.
* 猫, 舌
* Cat, Tongue
* [sound:猫舌_b.mp3]
* [sound:猫舌_g.mp3]
