## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> extract</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to extract</span>.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Just go ahead and extract it out of your memory so you can use it here.
* 抜
* Extract
* [sound:抜く_b.mp3]
