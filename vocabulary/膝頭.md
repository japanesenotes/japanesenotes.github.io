## Mnemonics:
今年アップル社は、膝頭認証の開発を始めるらしい。
* Apparently, Apple is going to start developing kneecap recognition.
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> knee</span>'s <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> head</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kneecap</span>. It's also called the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> patella</span>, if you want to get fancy and talk about bone names.
* This word uses the kun'yomi readings for both kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [頭](https://jisho.org/search/頭)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You're walking around in your mom's house, minding your own business, when you slam your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kneecap</span> right into that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ga</span>rgoyle <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> she love</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がしら](https://jisho.org/search/がしら)</span>). It hurts so bad, you can't even think out that phrase and instead you shout out, GA SHE RA and fall to the floor, clutching your searing kneecap (which has probably broken in half).
* 膝, 頭
* Knee, Head
* [sound:膝頭_b.mp3]
* [sound:膝頭_g.mp3]
