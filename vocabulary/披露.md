## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Expose</span> what you want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> expose</span> by making an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> announcement</span>. Then <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> show</span> the world!
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [露](https://jisho.org/search/露)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You're making the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> announcement</span> from a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> row</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ろう](https://jisho.org/search/ろう)</span>) boat. People will pay more attention when you're in a row boat because it's kind of weird. Especially since you're in a row boat on a stage.
* 披, 露
* Expose, Expose
* [sound:披露_b.mp3]
