## Mnemonics:
「あの野球の試合は本当にひどかったね。」「本当にそうだね。」
* That baseball game was really terrible. Yeah, tell me about it.
* An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attempt</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> join</span> together isn't just any get together. Imagine two people boxing. They attempt to knock each other out when they join together. That's why this word is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> game</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> match</span>. Did you watch the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [試合]([試](https://jisho.org/search/試)合)</span> today? No! Don't tell me what happened, I recorded it on the VHS.
* This word uses the on'yomi <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span> for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [試](https://jisho.org/search/試)</span> and the kun'yomi <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あい](https://jisho.org/search/あい)</span> for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [合](https://jisho.org/search/合)</span>. You learned both of these readings already, so you should be able to put them together!
* 試, 合
* Try, Suit
