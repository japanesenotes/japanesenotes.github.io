## Mnemonics:
ほら、また始まった。あんたって本当にいつも自分の夫の不満ばかり言っているよね。
* There you go again, always complaining about your husband.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: Think about your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> husband</span> even if you don't have one. What's his name? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Otto</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おっと](https://jisho.org/search/おっと)</span>), and he's always leaving you at home because he's working at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> auto</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おっと](https://jisho.org/search/おっと)</span>) shop.
* 夫
* Husband
* [sound:夫_b.mp3]
