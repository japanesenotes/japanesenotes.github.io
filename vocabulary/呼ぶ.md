## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> call</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to call</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to call out</span>. As in HEY, YOU!
* The reading is the same as the kanji, so you should be good here. Just imagine yourself  calling out to someone: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> YO</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よ](https://jisho.org/search/よ)</span>)! You!
* 呼
* Call
