## Mnemonics:

* 
* Hey look! If you weren't sick of them yet, it's another verb that goes with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shake</span>! This one means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to shake</span> too!
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading when you learned <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [揺る](https://jisho.org/search/揺る)</span>, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [揺する](https://jisho.org/search/揺する)</span>, and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [揺れる](https://jisho.org/search/揺れる)</span> so I reeeeally hope you can remember it by now!
