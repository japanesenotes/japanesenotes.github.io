## Mnemonics:
膝小僧の調子はどうですか？
* How's your kneecap?
* In your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> knee</span> there is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> small</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> priest</span> named <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kneecap</span>.<br />This is a really common, cute way of talking about your kneecap. It's usually used by kids and adults alike, and it's more common in spoken Japanese than <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [膝頭]([膝](https://jisho.org/search/膝)頭)</span>. Kind of like how we use kneecap instead of naming the patella bone all the time.
* This word uses the kun'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [膝](https://jisho.org/search/膝)</span> plus the on'yomi readings for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [小僧](https://jisho.org/search/小僧)</span>. You've learned them all already, so you should be able to read this as long as you remember them all.
* 膝, 小, 僧
* Knee, Small, Priest
* [sound:膝小僧_b.mp3]
* [sound:膝小僧_g.mp3]
