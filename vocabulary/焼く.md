## Mnemonics:
あなたの旦那さんも、ケーキを焼くの？
* Does your hubby bake cakes too?
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bake</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cook</span>. So, the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to bake</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to cook</span>.
* The reading comes from the reading you learned with the kanji.
* 焼
* Bake
* [sound:焼く_b.mp3]
