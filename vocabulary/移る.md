## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shift</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be shifted</span>. You know that this is the one where something is shifted (and you're not doing the shifting), because it's really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ru</span>de (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span>) to be shifted, and you don't like it when people do it to you (because it happens quite a lot, strangely).
* The reading is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [移す](https://jisho.org/search/移す)</span>, so use that to remember this!
* 移
* Shift
* [sound:移る_b.mp3]
* [sound:移る_g.mp3]
