## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rare</span>? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rare</span>. But, this can also mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> unusual</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> curious</span> (as in odd curious, not that you're curious about something).
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You know what's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> unusual</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rare</span>? This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> maze</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ra</span>re (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [めずら](https://jisho.org/search/めずら)</span>). I don't think there's a way out of it. We've been walking around for days now, and we haven't gotten any closer to the exit!
