## Mnemonics:
幸せな時、いつも時が止まればいいのに、と思う。
* Whenever I’m happy, I always think it would be nice if I could stop time.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />What <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> time</span> is it? It's time <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とき](https://jisho.org/search/とき)</span>) your enemy's car. Imagine yourself looking at your watch, waiting until the correct time to perform a synchronized keying of someone's car. Who do you hate the most? Whose car would you like to key?
* 時
* Time
* [sound:時_b.mp3]
* [sound:時_g.mp3]
