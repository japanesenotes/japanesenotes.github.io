## Mnemonics:
「ちょっと待って。財布を落としましたよ！」「ありがとう。でも、もし私がわざと落としたって言ったら、どうしますか？」
* Hold up! You dropped your wallet! Thank you, but what would you do if I said I dropped it on purpose?
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wealth</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cloth</span> is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wallet</span>. Really, a wallet is just a piece of cloth you keep in your pocket that has your wealth in it, right? This can also be your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> purse</span>, especially if you live in the ol' UK.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 財, 布
* Wealth, Cloth
