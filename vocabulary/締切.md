## Mnemonics:

* 
* You saw <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [締める](https://jisho.org/search/締める)</span>, which means to tighten. So when things tighten, and then they get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cut</span> off, it's when you've reached the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deadline</span>. You know that feeling? When you get close, you feel a tightening in your stomach. The deadline is near! But, then when your tightening gets cut off completely, it's because you've reached the end. The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deadline</span>.
* The reading is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [締める](https://jisho.org/search/締める)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [切る](https://jisho.org/search/切る)</span> put together. Notice how the hiragana bits get pushed into the kanji though, that's the interesting part, but also the part that's hard to remember. It's probably because this is a short version of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [締め切り](https://jisho.org/search/締め切り)</span>, but you'll see <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [締切](https://jisho.org/search/締切)</span> more often.
* 締, 切
* Tighten, Cut
