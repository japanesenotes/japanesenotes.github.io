## Mnemonics:
私の好きな物を三つ挙げるなら、チキンと揚げ物とご飯です。
* My three favorite things are chicken, fried foods, and rice.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading, but you haven't learned it yet. Here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />What game has the most <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thing</span>s in it? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Mono</span>poly (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もの](https://jisho.org/search/もの)</span>). You can choose from a bunch of random things to play as, you know? And no one actually knows what those things are. What's a thimble anyway? Just call it a thing.
* 物
* Thing
* [sound:物_b.mp3]
* [sound:物_g.mp3]
