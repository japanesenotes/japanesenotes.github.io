## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />When you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sail</span> in a ship you can't forget to bring a garden <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hoe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほ](https://jisho.org/search/ほ)</span>). If you lose your sails or your paddles, you can always use a hoe to paddle your way back. Or if you wreck on an island you can use the hoe to garden so you won't die of starvation! Hoes are very handy!
