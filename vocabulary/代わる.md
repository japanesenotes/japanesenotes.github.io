## Mnemonics:
私はスティーブ・ジョブズに代わる天才を探しています。
* I am looking for another genius to replace Steve Jobs.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> substitute</span>, so we can get to the meaning of this word through that: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> To replace</span> / <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to substitute for</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span> portion. <br />You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to replace</span> your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> car</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>). It is getting old, and seems like it will explode at any moment, literally.
