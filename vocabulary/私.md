昨日の夜、バーデビューしちゃった。私もちょっとずつ大人の階段登ってるって感じ？
* I went to a bar for the first time last night. I feel like I’m slowly becoming an adult.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* If you're lucky, you already know this (very) common word's reading. It's the word for I, probably one of the first things you'd learn in Japanese. The reading for this is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> わたし</span>. If you don't know that already, just think: What, a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>? referring to the reading of the kanji, which is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>.
