## Mnemonics:
ジェロってほんとにキモい。ドクロマークの絵が描かれた札でも付けておくべきだよ。
* Jello is really disgusting. There should be a picture of a skull and crossbones on the label.
* This word is almost the same as the kanji, but only half of it. It means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tag</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> amulet</span>. They're about the same shape and size as money, but you can't buy a house with them (...probably).
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:<br />You can't find your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tag</span> anywhere. It was on your luggage, you swear, but now it's nowhere to be found. You forget about it for a while, then you eat your dinner (you're at a fancy dinner party). As you finish up your meal you see something. Your label fell into your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> food</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふだ](https://jisho.org/search/ふだ)</span>)!
