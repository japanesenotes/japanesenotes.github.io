## Mnemonics:

* 
* The things that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> line up</span> are the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ordinary</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> average</span> things. The extraordinary things skip the line, because they don't have to wait. Sad for all the ordinaries.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: All the people who went off to fight in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Nam</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なみ](https://jisho.org/search/なみ)</span>) were just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ordinary</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> average</span> folk.
