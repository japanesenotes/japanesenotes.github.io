## Mnemonics:
学校での厳しい一日を終えて、仲間たちとリラックスをした。
* Me and my group of friends relaxed after a hard day at school.
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> relationship</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> intervals</span>... this doesn't make much sense at first, but if you think about it, at certain intervals from within your friends, you'll run into someone who's your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> companion</span>... not just any old friend. Something better. Something part of your group.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [仲](https://jisho.org/search/仲)</span> is the one you learned. The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [間](https://jisho.org/search/間)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ま](https://jisho.org/search/ま)</span>) is one you didn't learn with the kanji. Think through all your companions in your life. Imagine one of them is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ma</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ま](https://jisho.org/search/ま)</span>). She's on your pirate crew, and a pretty awesome pirate.
