## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> include</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to include</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />They don't want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to include</span> you in their game? Well, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> F***</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふく](https://jisho.org/search/ふく)</span>) you! you yell at them, because they wouldn't include you.
