## Mnemonics:

* 
* Somehow the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> portable</span> turns into the verb <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to engage in</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to participate</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to take part in</span>. I suppose if you are portable, you're able to engage in all kinds of things, since you can move all over the place, participating everywhere you can (rather than being not portable and being stuck in one place).
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Taz saw</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たずさ](https://jisho.org/search/たずさ)</span>) is a saw owned by a Tazmanian, and it is particularly portable. It allows you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to participate</span> in all kinds of things, like  cutting down trees, or being in a horror film.
