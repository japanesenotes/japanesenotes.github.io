## Mnemonics:
ビエトがミスを犯すことなどない。ビエトに不可能は無い。
* Viet is incapable of making mistakes. For Viet, nothing is impossible.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crime</span> so the verb vocab version would be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to commit a crime</span> (because you don't just to crime, right?).
* You go <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to commit a crime</span>. How did it go, you think? Well, I thought it went <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> oka</span>y (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おか](https://jisho.org/search/おか)</span>). Imagine yourself committing a crime and it going just okay. Not great, not bad... meh. Okay.
* 犯
* Crime
