## Mnemonics:
プラグが外れたので、Mr.ロボットはありがとうといえなくなった。
* Since the plug was disconnected, Mr.Robot was no longer able to say, thank you, anymore.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb.<br />This is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> outside</span> so this is when something goes too far outside and disconnects. Something comes off. No direct object here, see? That's why this verb means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be disconnected</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be out</span>
* You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はず](https://jisho.org/search/はず)</span> portion of this word. Think of it this way - you're on your phone and you are disconnected. Why were you disconnected? You look around and see a yellow <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> haze</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はず](https://jisho.org/search/はず)</span>) floating around, melting everyone's phones. Well that's lame. Too bad you can't call anyone to help you get your phone back.
* 外
