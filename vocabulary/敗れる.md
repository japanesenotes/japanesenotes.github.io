## Mnemonics:
オリンピックの予選第一回戦で敗れた日本代表のアイスホッケーチームに、怒ってカレーを投げつけた男の話聞いた？
* Did you hear that a guy got upset with Japan’s national hockey team when they were defeated in the first round of a preliminary game for the Olympics and threw some curry at them?
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> failure</span>, but to failure doesn't make sense. What happens when you experience failure, though? Well you get defeated, and you're also unsuccessful. So, this verb is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be defeated</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be unsuccessful</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You have been defeated. You lay there on the ground, and the fans around the stadium are disgusted with your performance. Some hipster walks up to you and says: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Yah, Boo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [やぶ](https://jisho.org/search/やぶ)</span>) referring to how poorly you did. No boo! you reply back. Yah boo they say again.
* 敗
* Failure
* [sound:敗れる_b.mp3]
* [sound:敗れる_g.mp3]
