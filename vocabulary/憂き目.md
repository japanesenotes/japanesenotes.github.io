## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Grief</span> shows in your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eye</span>s by making them look like you've gone through a lot of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bitterness</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hardship</span>. You can always see it in someone else if you look them in the eyes too.
* This word uses the kun'yomi readings for the kanji. You kind of learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [憂](https://jisho.org/search/憂)</span>, but not exactly. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember it: <br />The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bitterness</span> that shows in your eyes takes the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ray</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れ](https://jisho.org/search/れ)</span>) of light out of them, leaving you with just the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> part of the reading that you know. That's why this reading is just <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> and not <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)れ</span> like the others.
