## Mnemonics:
豆腐と河豚のハンバーガーが出来上がりました。
* The tofu and fugu hamburgers are done!
* You've seen the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [出来る](https://jisho.org/search/出来る)</span> (to be able to do), which is the first part. Then the second part, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [上がる](https://jisho.org/search/上がる)</span> means to rise. So, think about it this way: once you're able to do something, you rise because you're finished. That's why this verb means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be finished</span>.
* The reading is a combination of the readings from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [出来る](https://jisho.org/search/出来る)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [上がる](https://jisho.org/search/上がる)</span>. So long as you were paying attention in lessons past, you should be able to read this word as well just by combining those other words.
* 出, 来, 上
* Exit, Come, Above
* [sound:出来上がる_b.mp3]
