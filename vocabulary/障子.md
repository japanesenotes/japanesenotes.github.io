## Mnemonics:

* 
* It can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hinder</span> a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> child</span>, but that's about it. This is a Japanese Sliding Door. They're often made of rice paper after all, so, you know, an adult can go through it but a child would be hindered by it.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span> is changed from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span> to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span>, though, so be careful.
* 障, 子
