## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mourning</span>? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> unpleasant</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> disgusting</span>. Nobody said mourning was fun.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Your mourning is especially <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> unpleasant</span> because it's your pet <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>) you're mourning for. Your parents wouldn't let you bury him so you're just staring at his week old, dead eagle body. It's super <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> disgusting</span>, actually.
