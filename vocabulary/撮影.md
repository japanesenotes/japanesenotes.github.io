* Back in the day, you'd use shadows to photograph things. Now it's all fancy and digital. So, with that in mind, a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> photograph</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shadow</span> was someone doing a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> photoshoot</span> of some kind. And, in even more modern times, it has become a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> movie shoot</span> as well. More simply, it can be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> photographing</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> filming</span> as well. Basically, if it has to do with taking photos or video, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [撮影](https://jisho.org/search/撮影)</span> is your dude.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 撮, 影
* Photograph, Shadow
