## Mnemonics:
この話は、一旦無しにしてもらえますか。
* Could you cancel this deal for now?
* This is the noun version of the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nothing</span>, so when you have nothing, you are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> without</span>. 
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />When you are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> without</span> you don't have anything to eat either, so you end up <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gnashi</span>ng (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なし](https://jisho.org/search/なし)</span>) your teeth together instead.
* 無
* Nothing
* [sound:無し_b.mp3]
* [sound:無し_g.mp3]
