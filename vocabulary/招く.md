## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beckon</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to beckon</span>. It can also mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to invite</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to summon</span> as well.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You move <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to beckon</span> your friend over. You can't see him well, so that's why you invite him to come closer. He is hiding something, and it turns out to be his long, luxurious horse <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mane</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まね](https://jisho.org/search/まね)</span>). Why does he have a mane!? Horse steroids?
