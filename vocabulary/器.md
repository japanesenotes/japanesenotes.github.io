## Mnemonics:
まず最初にごはんを器に入れて、次にハンバーグをのせて、それからグレービーソースをかけて、最後に卵をのせたら…ジャーン！ロコモコの出来上がり！
* First you put some rice in a bowl, then you put a hamburger patty on the rice, followed by some gravy, and then an egg on top. Then, ta-da! Now, your Loco-moco is done!
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Also, you can call this a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bowl</span>, too, if you want.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You have this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> container</span>. It's upside down with a stick holding it up and a string on the stick. You're going to catch some U2s (like, the band). You put some food under it and wait. Then, out of the bushes comes Bono. He sniffs around for a bit and then goes under the container. You pull! <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> U2 wa</span>lked (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うつわ](https://jisho.org/search/うつわ)</span>) right into the trap! Haha!
