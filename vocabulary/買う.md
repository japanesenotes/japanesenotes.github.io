コウイチのボブルヘッド人形を買うために、長い行列ができていた。
* There was a long line of people waiting to buy the Koichi bobblehead.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> buy</span> so the verb form is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to buy</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. If you remember your kanji readings, you'll be just fine.
