## Mnemonics:
二度と戻って来るんじゃねーぞ！
* Never come back!
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> come</span> so you know this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to come</span>.
* The reading for this word is pretty strange. It changes depending on the type of verb form you use (it's a pesky exception verb). To remember the reading of this word, here's a mnemonic: <br />I want you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to come</span> to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coo</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [く](https://jisho.org/search/く)</span>) side, Luke, says Darth Vader.<br />What? replies Luke.<br />Just replace this line into the famous line from Star Wars. Say it out loud. Do the Vader voice. It'll help you to remember.
* 来
* Come
* [sound:来る_b.mp3]
* [sound:来る_g.mp3]
