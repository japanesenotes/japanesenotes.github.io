## Mnemonics:
「側にいてくれてありがとう。」「何言ってるのよ！友達じゃないの！」
* Thank you for taking my side. What are you talking about? We’re friends, aren’t we?
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> friend</span> that you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attain</span> is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> friend</span>. This is the most common way to say friend, so learn it if you want to make any!
* The readings for both of these are readings you haven't learned yet, though maybe you already know this word since it's fairly common. Think of it this way. You have your friend <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Tom</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とも](https://jisho.org/search/とも)</span>) Cruise. You like him, and he likes you. You're close enough friends that you can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> touch</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だち](https://jisho.org/search/だち)</span>) each other too. Like, on the shoulder or on the hand or whatever, without it being awkward. So, you like to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Tom touch</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とも](https://jisho.org/search/とも)だち</span>) when you can, because he has nice skin.
* 友, 達
* Friend, Attain
