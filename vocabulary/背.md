## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br /><span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Say</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せ](https://jisho.org/search/せ)</span>) your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> height</span> right now. Say it. SAY IT. Imagine I'm getting all in your face, saying say it at you.
