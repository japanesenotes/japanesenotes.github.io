## Mnemonics:
日本では新聞の号外は大抵無料で配られます。
* In Japan, we usually hand out an extra issue of the newspaper for free.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* This word is made up of a single kanji all alone, but it uses the on'yomi reading. This is probably because you'll usually see this word attached to other things, like numbers. This shows the edition or number of an item. So, even though it's alone, it's usually used like jukugo, which is why the reading for this one is the same as the reading you learned when you learned the kanji.
* 号
