## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> recruit</span> so the verb vocab version would, you'd think, be 'to recruit,' but it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to appeal for</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to invite</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to raise</span>. So, it's kind of like recruiting, but instead of people, you're recruiting for things and actions.<br />This verb can also be intransitive (oh my!) and mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to grow violent</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to become stronger</span>. It's like all of that recruiting is happening inside of you and causing some weird things to happen to you!
* You'd like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to appeal for</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two, no</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つの](https://jisho.org/search/つの)</span>), three things! Three!
