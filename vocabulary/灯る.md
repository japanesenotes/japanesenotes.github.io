The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lamp</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to burn</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be lit</span>. Just like what you'd do with a lamp.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.
