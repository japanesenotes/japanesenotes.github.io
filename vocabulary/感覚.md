* You know how we use <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> feeling</span>s to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> memorize</span> things here on WaniKani? I ask you to feel angry or sad or happy while imagining out the mnemonic stories. I also ask you to use your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> senses</span>, because feelings are memorized best when you use <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> the senses</span>.
