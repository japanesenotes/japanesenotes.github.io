## Mnemonics:
くつ下のかたほうは、かいだんの上にあったわよ。
* One of your socks was at the top of the stairs.
* When a vocab word is a single kanji and alone, it tends to steal the meaning from the kanji. Same goes for this one too. It means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> above</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> up</span>.
* When a vocab word is a single kanji and doesn't have okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it usually will use the kun'yomi. Since you learned the on'yomi reading of the kanji, we'll need to use a mnemonic to learn the reading of this vocabulary word. <br /><span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Above</span> you is a huge weight. You're holding it up and struggling (it's heavy!). You look up and try to crane your neck to see how much it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> weigh</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うえ](https://jisho.org/search/うえ)</span>), but you can't see the numbers on the side of it. How long can you hold it above your head like this?
* 上
