## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> throw away</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to throw away</span>.
* The reading is the one you learned with the kanji, so no need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to throw away</span> that bit of knowledge just yet!
* 捨
* Throw Away
* [sound:捨てる_b.mp3]
* [sound:捨てる_g.mp3]
