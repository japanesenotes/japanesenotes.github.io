## Mnemonics:
私には、セーラームーンを見るのを止めるための強い意志が欠けている。
* I lack the willpower to stop watching Sailor Moon.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lack</span> so the vocab verb version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to lack</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You lack something... it's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>). You can't stop thinking about this because you have to walk 40 miles to get to your destination. If only you didn't lack a car this would be easier. Imagine the sweat... the pain... the thirst... all because you lack a car.
* 欠
