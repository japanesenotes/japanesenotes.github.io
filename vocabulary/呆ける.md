## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shock</span>. What happens when you're so old that your brain goes into shock? You start <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to grow senile</span>. It's sad, but lots of people can't handle being old and they get like this.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />When you start <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to grow senile</span> you'll make a new friend. It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Bo</span>bo (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼ](https://jisho.org/search/ぼ)</span>) the clown! No one else can see him though, but that's okay! He'll become your very best friend. And he won't leave until you finally kick the bucket.
