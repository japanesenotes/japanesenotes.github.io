## Mnemonics:
もし俺がこのポーカーゲームでかったら、お前らに俺のリザードンのカードを見せてやるよ。
* If I win this poker game, I’ll show you guys my Charizard card.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. Also present is the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せ](https://jisho.org/search/せ)</span> which means you're causing someone to do something. You could say you're causing someone to see something, but that sounds weird. A better translation would be to call this word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to show</span>.
* The reading for this word is the same as the one that you learned with the kanji, so you should be able to read it.
* 見

* [sound:見せる_b.mp3]
* [sound:見せる_g.mp3]
