* If you don't want your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thought</span>s to turn <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rust colored</span>, you need to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> diligent</span> and studying, learning, and experiencing new things. Without diligence your brain and all your thoughts will get old, and stale, turning a rusty, gross color.
