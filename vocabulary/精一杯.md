## Mnemonics:

* 
* You put <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> one cup of liquid</span>... no, one full cup of liquid spirit into what you're doing. None of this half-cup garbage. A full one. That means you're going at it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> with all one's might</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Will help if you've seen <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [一杯](https://jisho.org/search/一杯)</span> before.
