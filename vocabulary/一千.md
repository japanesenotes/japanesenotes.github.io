## Mnemonics:
一千フィートのたかさでおならをした。
* I farted at an elevation of 1000 feet.
* If you have one thousand, you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> one thousand</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The only thing that's a bit weird is the reading of the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [一](https://jisho.org/search/一)</span>. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ち](https://jisho.org/search/ち)</span> turns into a small <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [っ](https://jisho.org/search/っ)</span>, making the reading for this word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> いっせん</span>.
* 一, 千
* One, Thousand
* [sound:一千_b.mp3]
* [sound:一千_g.mp3]
