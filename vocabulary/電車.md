## Mnemonics:
ホグワーツ特急は電車じゃなくて汽車です。
* The Hogwarts Express isn’t an electric train, it’s a steam train.
* You would think that an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> electricity</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> car</span> was an electric car, but this word was made before the days of the Prius. This refers to a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> train</span>, which I guess was electric at some point.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 電, 車
* Electricity, Car
* [sound:電車_b.mp3]
