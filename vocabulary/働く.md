## Mnemonics:
「金曜日、Tofuguの記事を読みに来ませんか？」「行きたいんですが、金曜日の夜は遅くまで働かないといけないんです。」「それは残念ですね。それでは、また今度。」
* Would you like to come read Tofugu articles on Friday? I’d like to but I have to work late Friday night. That’s too bad. Maybe some other time.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> work</span> so the verb vocab version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to work</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: If you are as mad as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hatter</span> you'll need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to work</span> very hard to regain your sanity. You know The Hatter from Alice in Wonderland? Imagine how hard he would have to work to be considered normal.
* 働
* Work
* [sound:働く_b.mp3]
