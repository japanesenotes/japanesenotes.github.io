## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prolong</span> and this verb means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to prolong</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Do you mind if I go <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to prolong</span> things? The answer? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> No</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [の](https://jisho.org/search/の)</span>), I don't mind.
