## Mnemonics:
太陽が眩しくて、風船がどのくらいの高さまで上がっていったのかほとんど見えなかった。
* The sun was so bright, I could barely see how high the balloon had risen.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> see</span>, and the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [える]([え](https://jisho.org/search/え)る)</span> (with the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [え](https://jisho.org/search/え)</span> in there) suggests that this is potential form. So, instead of just being to see this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> can see</span> or just plain old <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> visible</span>.
* The reading for this word is the same as the one you learned with the kanji (the kun'yomi reading). So as long as you know that you should be able to read this word as well.
* 見
