## Mnemonics:
あのお医者さんに、「体調を保つためには、日々の運動が大切だよ」なんて言われたけど、そのお医者さん自体がすっごく太ってるんだよね。
* The doctor told me that it’s important to exercise regularly to maintain your physical health, but he is so fat.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> preserve</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to preserve</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />If you want to learn how <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to preserve</span> fruits and veggies, you should start with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tamots</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たも](https://jisho.org/search/たも)</span>), that's slang for delish tomatoes. Once they're preserved, you get to make everyone you love eat those yummy tamots. Mmm!
* 保
* Preserve
* [sound:保つ_b.mp3]
* [sound:保つ_g.mp3]
