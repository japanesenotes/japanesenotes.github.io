## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* You learned the on'yomi reading which is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [どん](https://jisho.org/search/どん)</span>. This is just an extension of that, coming out to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [どん](https://jisho.org/search/どん)ぶり</span>. You can remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶり](https://jisho.org/search/ぶり)</span> part because you know what your favorite rice bowl is... it's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> brie</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶり](https://jisho.org/search/ぶり)</span>) cheese rice bowl. So delicious, yum.
