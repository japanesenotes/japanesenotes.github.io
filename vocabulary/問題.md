「お願いがあるんだけど。」「いいけど、何？」「週末、私の犬の世話をしてもらえないかな？」「問題ないよ。任せといて。」
* Can you do me a favor? Sure, what is it? Can you look after my dog for the weekend? No problem. You can count on me.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> problem</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> topic</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> problem</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> question</span> you have to answer. If you think about it, topics as problems tends to be a school-related thing. So, when you have to answer a problem in school, that's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [問題](https://jisho.org/search/問題)</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
