## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Narrow</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> biased</span> people are considered to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> narrow minded</span> and they're usually disliked for their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> intolerance</span> of other cultures and anything unfamiliar to them.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [狭](https://jisho.org/search/狭)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />The only place <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> narrow minded</span> people will go in Japan is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kyo</span>to (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょう](https://jisho.org/search/きょう)</span>). It's where all the tour guides say to go, and they're too narrow minded to listen to anyone else. So they see Kyoto and head back home right away without seeing anywhere else.
