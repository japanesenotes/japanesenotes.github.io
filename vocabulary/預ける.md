## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deposit</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to deposit</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: In terms of places where you want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to deposit</span> your money, #1 on your list is the Bank of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Az</span>gard (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あず](https://jisho.org/search/あず)</span>). Why? Because it's protected by Norse Gods, and that's the protection your money deserves.
