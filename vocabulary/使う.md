そんなに屁っ放り腰にならないで！知ってる日本語をできるだけ使うようにしなよ。
* Don’t be afraid of that. You should use the Japanese you know as much as possible.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> use</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to use</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.
