## Mnemonics:
この鳥をいつか籠から放つつもりですか。
* When are you thinking of letting this bird out of the cage?
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. You already learned the verbs <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [放す](https://jisho.org/search/放す)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [放れる](https://jisho.org/search/放れる)</span> but this one is a little different. This is a specific kind of releasing. It means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to fire</span> an arrow, or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to hit</span> a baseball. It even works when you're releasing a fart. Yes, it means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to break wind</span> too. What a great word!
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading already so you should be able to read it!

* Release
