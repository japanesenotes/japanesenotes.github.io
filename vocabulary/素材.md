## Mnemonics:

* When you want to use the most basic <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> element</span>s of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> material</span>, you end up with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> raw material</span>s. Maybe it's the raw materials you're going to use to build a house. Maybe it's the raw materials you need to make a good soup. Either way, they haven't been touched much (yet).
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [素](https://jisho.org/search/素)</span> is the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そ](https://jisho.org/search/そ)</span> reading, so be careful. You can remember by thinking how you have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sew</span> the building together using these raw materials.
* 素, 材
* Element, Lumber
