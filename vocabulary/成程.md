## Mnemonics:

* 
* If you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> become</span> aware of something to an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> extent</span> you'll end up saying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> I see</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> That's right</span>! But you won't see if you didn't become aware enough. So it's that extent of understanding you're trying to reach before you can chime in with an Ahh, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> indeed</span>.
* The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [成](https://jisho.org/search/成)</span> is from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [成](https://jisho.org/search/成)る</span> and it keeps the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span> part. It's just hidden in the kanji. If you can remember that, you'll know this reading!
* 成, 程
* Become, Extent
* [sound:成程_b.mp3]
* [sound:成程_g.mp3]
