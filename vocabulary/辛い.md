## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. That being said, this can also mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> difficult</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> painful</span> as well. I guess if you're in a spicy situation it's going to be a difficult one.
* Depending on the context, the reading for this word could be <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [からい]([から](https://jisho.org/search/から)い)</span> or <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つらい]([つら](https://jisho.org/search/つら)い)</span>. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [からい]([から](https://jisho.org/search/から)い)</span> reading is the spicy one, you can remember that because that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spicy</span> feeling comes from (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [から](https://jisho.org/search/から)</span>) your mouth. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つらい]([つら](https://jisho.org/search/つら)い)</span> reading is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> difficult</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> painful</span> one. You can remember this because <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two Ra</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つら](https://jisho.org/search/つら)</span>) are way more difficult to deal with than one Ra.
