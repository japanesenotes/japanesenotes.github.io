## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pay respects</span> but the verb is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to ask</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to inquire</span>. Basically this is a slightly polite way to ask about something. It's still pretty neutral feeling though, so it's not super duper polite.
* Excuse me, I'd like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to inquire</span> about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> you, kaga</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うかが](https://jisho.org/search/うかが)</span>). You're asking questions about Chairman Kaga, the ruler over the Iron Chef kingdom.
