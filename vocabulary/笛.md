## Mnemonics:
あの笛を持っている男の人がコウイチさんだよ。
* That guy holding the whistle is Mr. Koichi.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: Pretend you're trying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> whistle</span>, but you can't. All that comes out is air. You make a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Fuuuuuuueh</span> sound over and over, because you can't get the whole whistling thing down. Go ahead and pretend to do that (or do it for real).
* 笛
* Flute
* [sound:笛_b.mp3]
* [sound:笛_g.mp3]
