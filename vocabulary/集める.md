## Mnemonics:
私は外国の食べ物の写真を集めている。
* I am collecting pictures of foreign food.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> collect</span> so the vocab verb version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to collect</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />When you only have one thing, there's only one thing. Nothing is collected. But when you have two... <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ah two</span>! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あつ](https://jisho.org/search/あつ)</span>). Now you're starting <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to collect</span> things.
* 集
* Collect
* [sound:集める_b.mp3]
* [sound:集める_g.mp3]
