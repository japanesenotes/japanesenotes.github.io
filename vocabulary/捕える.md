## Mnemonics:

* 
* Remember how you learned <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [捕まる](https://jisho.org/search/捕まる)</span> is to be caught. Well this is the transitive version, so it means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to catch</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to capture</span>. You (or someone else) is doing the catching, which is better than being the one who gets caught, I suppose.
* The reading is also not the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [捕まる](https://jisho.org/search/捕まる)</span>. Sorry! It does have a similar reading to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [取る](https://jisho.org/search/取る)</span> though, which also has to do with grabbing things (like grabbing onto an idea, for example). You can use <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [取る](https://jisho.org/search/取る)</span> as a jumping off point for remembering the reading of this word.
* 捕
* Catch
