## Mnemonics:
コウイチは、日本に軍隊を派遣する決意を固めた。
* Koichi decided to fortify his position and send his troops to Japan.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hard</span> so the verb vocab version? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> To make hard</span>. You need to differentiate this from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [固まる]([固](https://jisho.org/search/固)まる)</span>, though, which means to harden (the hardening happens on its own). This word means to make hard, because you're doing the hardening. You can remember this because you want to make something hard. And to do that, you send special <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mail</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [める](https://jisho.org/search/める)</span>) to this thing you want to make hard, and this mail does that for you.
* Since the reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [固](https://jisho.org/search/固)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かた](https://jisho.org/search/かた)</span>) is different than the one you learned with the kanji, here's a mnemonic to help you out. A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cate</span>rpillar (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かた](https://jisho.org/search/かた)</span>) forms a cocoon. The caterpillar's cocoon is hard and the caterpillar made it that way. Keep this in mind and you too will blossom into a beautiful butterfly.
* 固
* Hard
* [sound:固める_b.mp3]
