## Mnemonics:
シャークは他人の災いを願っているようだね。
* It seems like Shark wishes misfortune upon other people.
* This is the noun form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> disaster</span>, though it is more like a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> personal disaster</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> personal misfortune</span>. Just picture that flood from the kanji sweeping you up into your own personal disaster—one only you experience.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />When a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> personal disaster</span> strikes, you start moaning and groaning. Say it along with me: Wahhhhh! Zaahhhh! Waahhhh! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わざわ](https://jisho.org/search/わざわ)</span>). Be careful of the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, it can be tricky and make you think it's an adjective when it's a noun.
* 災
* Disaster
* [sound:災い_b.mp3]
* [sound:災い_g.mp3]
