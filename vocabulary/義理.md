## Mnemonics:

* 
* You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> righteousness</span> and then a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reason</span> behind it, at least in your own mind. This is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sense of duty</span>. And it really is a sense in a way, too. You just feel it. It's not an actual thing that is tangible. It is your own personal reason for this righteousness.<br />This word can also mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> in-law</span> like your mother-in-law, because they're your mother in the social obligation sense only, not by blood.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 義, 理
* Righteousness, Reason
