## Mnemonics:
どうして、「ビッグアンドトール」のスーツはあんなに値段が高いんだ？
* Why are suits from the Big and Tall store so expensive?
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tall</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> expensive</span>? It's the same: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tall</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> expensive</span>. <br />Weird that this word means both of these things, yeah? Just imagine money piled up to be really tall. That money is tall because it needs to buy something expensive.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />There's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tall</span> dude trying to sell you something really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> expensive</span>. He's really going off on how great this item is and how you should buy it. This guy is a real salesman. A real <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> talker</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たか](https://jisho.org/search/たか)</span>).
