## Mnemonics:
ああ、もう！お前のせいで完全に気が散っちゃったじゃないか！話したいことって何なんだよ。オフィスで飼う犬だっけか？
* Oh jeez! Now you’ve completely distracted me. What was it that you wanted to talk about... office dog, was it?
* When something is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> all</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> perfect</span> it is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> complete</span>. Not only that, but it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> perfect</span> (because it's ALL perfect, not just partially so).
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 完, 全
* Perfect, All
