## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scatter</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be scattered</span>. You know that this verb represents when something is scattering (you're not doing the scattering), because you would never be so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ru</span>de as to scatter someone or something yourself. It only happens when it happens on its own.
* Think about something scattering. That something is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chee</span>se (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ち](https://jisho.org/search/ち)</span>), scattering all over the floor, going everywhere, getting in everything. Ugh, you hate how cheese scatters, don't you?
* 散
* Scatter
* [sound:散る_b.mp3]
