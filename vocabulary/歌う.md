## Mnemonics:
「外は雨が降ってるね。外出せずに家で歌でも歌いたいな。」「じゃあ、こうしよう。今夜は出かけるのをやめよう。で、私が夕食を作るから、あなたは私のために歌ってよ。」
* It’s raining outside. I just want to stay in and sing. I’ll tell you what. Let’s stay in tonight and I’ll make dinner for you if you’ll sing songs for me.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> song</span> so the verb vocab version of this is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to sing</span>, because you don't to song, you to sing.
* Awesomely, this uses the same reading as the reading for the vocab words <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [歌](https://jisho.org/search/歌)</span>. Just throw the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> onto the end and you have yourself the reading. So, sing your heart out and learn this word easily.
