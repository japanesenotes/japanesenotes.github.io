## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.  You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foolish</span> person will take the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> o</span>ld <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> roa</span>d (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おろ](https://jisho.org/search/おろ)</span>), instead of the new, safe one. You have to be really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stupid</span> to take an old road that's all cracked and full of scary people. Take the new one!
* 愚
* Foolish
