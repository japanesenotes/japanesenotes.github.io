大切なしょるいときくと、いつも中みをみたくなる。
* Whenever I hear that a document is very important, I always want to look at what’s inside.
* Think back to the old old olden days. Back when decisions were made with swords. A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> big</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cut</span> is going to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> important</span>. Just imagine a couple samurai squaring off, then charging, then making one big cut. It's the most important thing they'll do in their lives (if they live!).
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 大, 切
* Big, Cut
* [sound:大切_b.mp3]
