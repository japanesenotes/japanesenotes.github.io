* He got drunk out of his mind Wednesday night and was run over by a truck.
* This is a day of the week. You know this because it has <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [曜日](https://jisho.org/search/曜日)</span> in it. But what day of the week is it? The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> water</span> day of the week is where the water flows from. Think of your entire week as a big hill, with Wednesday (hump day) being in the middle. This hump is a hill. What originates from hills? Water! That's why Water day is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Wednesday</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will help to know the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [曜日](https://jisho.org/search/曜日)</span> as well.
