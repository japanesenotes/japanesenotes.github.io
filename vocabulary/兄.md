## Mnemonics:
兄は、とうふにコーヒーをかけてたべるのがすきだ。
* My older brother likes eating tofu covered in coffee.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This implies that it is your older brother, by the way. Not somebody else's.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> older brother</span> is different from everyone else's. He has odd powers... some would say powers of the force. Do you know what his name is? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ani</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あに](https://jisho.org/search/あに)</span>), short for Anikin... wait a sec, does that sound familiar?
* 兄
* Older Brother
* [sound:兄_b.mp3]
* [sound:兄_g.mp3]
