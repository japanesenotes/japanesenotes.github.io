* This word uses the on'yomi reading for the kanji, but you haven't learned the on'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [岩](https://jisho.org/search/岩)</span>, which is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がん](https://jisho.org/search/がん)</span>. When you think of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lava</span>, think about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ga</span>ndhi, coming out of the lava. He's immune, because he's a robot.
