* It will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pass through</span> what you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> believe</span> and run into some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> netting</span>.

Netting this all up (all these communications!) leaves you with a communication network. What fun!
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
