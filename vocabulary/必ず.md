## Mnemonics:
何があっても必ずさい後までワニカニをやりとげます。
* I will certainly complete WaniKani no matter what.
* This word looks like a verb but it's not (sorry!). It's an adverb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> certain</span> and the vocab version means all sorts of variations on that: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> surely</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> certainly</span>, and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> without exception</span> to name a few.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Ra, the Egyptian god asks you: Can you do it? Are you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> certain</span> you can build the pyramids? <br />Yes I <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> can ra</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かなら](https://jisho.org/search/かなら)</span>). Yes I can, you reply.
* 必
* Certain
* [sound:必ず_b.mp3]
* [sound:必ず_g.mp3]
