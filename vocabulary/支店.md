## Mnemonics:
支店長の髭は少し長すぎる。
* Our branch manager’s mustache is a bit too long.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> support</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shop</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> branch office</span>. Presumably this is because the regular shop is the shop and anything that supports it is the local (branch) office.<br />If it helps, this word has the same meaning as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [支局](https://jisho.org/search/支局)</span> which you will also be learning in this level.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 支, 店
* Support, Shop
* [sound:支店_b.mp3]
