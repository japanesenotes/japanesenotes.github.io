## Mnemonics:
四十だいにもなると、ぜんしんがかゆい。
* Since reaching my forties, my entire body has been itchy.
* What do you get when you have four tens? You get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> forty</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. The only exception to this is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [四](https://jisho.org/search/四)</span>, which uses the kun'yomi reading, since the on'yomi reading sounds too much like the word for death. Luckily you know these reading already, so there's nothing new to learn!
* 四, 十
* Four, Ten
* [sound:四十_b.mp3]
* [sound:四十_g.mp3]
