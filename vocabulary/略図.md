## Mnemonics:

* 
* An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> abbreviation</span> version of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> diagram</span> isn't the completed diagram, nor is it one you spend a lot of time on. It's the abbreviated version, so it's more like a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rough sketch</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
