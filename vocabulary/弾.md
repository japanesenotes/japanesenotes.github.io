## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Remember <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [球](https://jisho.org/search/球)</span>? This is also a bullet shape (remember how bullets used to be round spheres?). These are both similar ideas, though their intent is different, and they share the same reading.
