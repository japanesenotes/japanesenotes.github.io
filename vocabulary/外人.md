## Mnemonics:
日本人と外人のあしのながさはかなりちがう。
* Leg length is quite different between Japanese people and foreigners.
* An outside person is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foreigner</span>. This word is fairly common, though it's not super polite, either. It's okay most of the time, but it can be used derogatorily depending on the situation. The more polite version is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [外国人](https://jisho.org/search/外国人)</span> (outside country person) but you won't learn that until you learn the kanji for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [国](https://jisho.org/search/国)</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. <br />Since <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [人](https://jisho.org/search/人)</span> has two on'yomi readings, you can remember that for this word it uses <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じん](https://jisho.org/search/じん)</span> because foreigners like to wear <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> jeans</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じん](https://jisho.org/search/じん)</span>).
* 外, 人
* Outside, Person
* [sound:外人_b.mp3]
* [sound:外人_g.mp3]
