## Mnemonics:
びようしさんから、かみのけが少ないとよくいわれます。
* I’m often told by hairdressers that I don’t have much hair.
* This word has a single kanji with hiragana attached, ending in a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>. This means you know it's an adjective. What is the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> few</span>? It's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> few</span>.
* The reading for this one is fairly difficult, as it's the kun'yomi reading (you can tell it's kun'yomi because of all the hiragana attached). You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すく](https://jisho.org/search/すく)</span> part to remember the reading of this word. Think of it this way: <br />You have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> few</span> of something. This something is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suck</span>ers (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すく](https://jisho.org/search/すく)</span>). Imagine putting all (three-ish) of them in your mouth at once. How does it taste? Can you taste the flavors from each of the few?
