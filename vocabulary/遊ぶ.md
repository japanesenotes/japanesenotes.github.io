## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> play</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to play</span>.
* You want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to play</span> with everyone, but every once in a while someone doesn't want to play with you. You know what? That's okay. If someone doesn't want to play with you, they're the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a**hole</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あそ](https://jisho.org/search/あそ)</span>), not you.
* 遊
* Play
