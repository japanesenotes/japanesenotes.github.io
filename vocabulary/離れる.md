## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> detach</span>, but what happens when something detaches? It causes it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to separate</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to leave</span>. This refers to when something separates on its own. You aren't doing the separating. You know this because it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rare</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れる](https://jisho.org/search/れる)</span>) to see things separate, but sometimes you do see them. Also, whenever you see <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れる](https://jisho.org/search/れる)</span> usually it's a safe bet that you're not the one doing the action, right? Think about it.
* For the reading, think about what is separating. It's quite sad, because all of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 花</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はな](https://jisho.org/search/はな)</span>) are separating from their stems and falling on the ground, and nobody knows why. Just falling off and being sad.
