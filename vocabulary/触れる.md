## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [触る](https://jisho.org/search/触る)</span> means to touch. This means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to feel</span>. It's kind of similar but somewhat different and also uses a different reading, making this word very hard in some ways. Just think how it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rare</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れる](https://jisho.org/search/れる)</span>) for you to feel anything at all, but this time you are, so that's nice, I guess.<br />The word also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to touch on</span>, not in the physical sense, but when you touch on a subject. That's why it also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to refer to</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to mention</span>.
* The reading is totally different from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [触る](https://jisho.org/search/触る)</span> so don't let that fool you. In this case, you feel some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fur</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふれ](https://jisho.org/search/ふれ)</span>).
* 触
