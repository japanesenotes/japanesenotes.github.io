## Mnemonics:
正三角形では，三つの角の大きさがみんな同じです。
* All three internal angles of an equilateral triangle are equal.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.<br />But this word has two different meanings and each one has its own reading. You should make sure you don't mix them up. The first one is the reading you learned with the kanji. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かく](https://jisho.org/search/かく)</span> means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> angle</span>.<br />The second reading (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かど](https://jisho.org/search/かど)</span>), is something you haven't learned, and it means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> corner</span>. Just picture a deck of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> card</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かど](https://jisho.org/search/かど)</span>). Now take one card at a time and fold them to make a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> corner</span>. Now tape those cards into all the corners of your house. Why? Because it's artsy!
