## Mnemonics:

* 
* An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> again</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clothes</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> room</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> changing room</span>. You get to change again, even after changing in the morning for the first time to leave your house. This can also be a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> locker room</span> or a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dressing room</span>, so really anywhere you can change that's not your home, usually.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
