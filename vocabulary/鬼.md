* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: <br /><span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Demon</span>s are mean. This particular demon bites you on the knee, creating an O shape on your knee. He tells you he has cursed you with the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> O knee</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おに](https://jisho.org/search/おに)</span>).
