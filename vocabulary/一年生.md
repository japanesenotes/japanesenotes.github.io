まだ小学一年生が学ぶ漢字ですら知りません。
* I haven’t even learned the kanji that first grade elementary school students know yet.
* You'd maybe think this just means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> one</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> year</span> of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> life</span>, but it actually means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> first year student</span>. A second year student is a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [二年生](https://jisho.org/search/二年生)</span>, and so on. Just think about how crazy the Japanese are about school. You can see why school is life, and not life itself, making this vocab word first year student.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 一, 年, 生
* One, Year, Life
* [sound:一年生_b.mp3]
* [sound:一年生_g.mp3]
