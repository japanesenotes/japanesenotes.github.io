## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a combination of the words <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [貫く](https://jisho.org/search/貫く)</span> meaning To Go Through and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [通す](https://jisho.org/search/通す)</span> meaning To Let Pass. So when you're trying to go through an area and also let someone pass with you, you start <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to follow</span> them. Not intentionally, but you're both trying to go through at the same time so you decide <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to stick with</span> them.
* This is a combination of two words you already know, so you should already know this too!
* 貫, 通
* Pierce, Pass Through
