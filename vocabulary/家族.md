今度、俺の日本への家族旅行のことを君に話したいな。
* I wanna tell you about my family vacation in Japan some time.
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> house</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tribe</span> is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> family</span>. They live in the same house as you and they're part of your tribe. This is closer than family, though (depending on how you look at family). This is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> immediate family</span> because these are the people you live with and give birth to, etc.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 家, 族
* House, Tribe
