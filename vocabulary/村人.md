* Pessimists say, the glass is half empty, but the villager surprised me by shouting Refill!
* You have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> village</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> person</span>. That isn't someone dancing while wearing construction worker clothes, that's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> villager</span>.
* This word uses double kun'yomi for its reading, probably because it's like two separate words (village and person) put together into one big word. You should know these two kun'yomi readings (it's the main reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [村](https://jisho.org/search/村)</span> that you learned and you should know <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [人](https://jisho.org/search/人)</span> by now), though you will need to look out for the rendaku'd <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> びと</span> reading.
* 村, 人
* Village, Person
