## Mnemonics:
「ニコールって、今、付き合っている人いるの？」「ええ。エリックと1年間付き合っているわ。」「そうなんだ！彼とは、どこで出会ったの？」
* Are you seeing anyone now, Nicole? Yes, I’ve been seeing Eric for a year. Wow, where did you guys meet?
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exit</span> your house and you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> meet</span> someone. You didn’t mean to meet them, but it happened anyway. That’s why this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to meet by chance</span>.
* The reading is that of the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [出る]([出](https://jisho.org/search/出)る)</span> and the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [会う](https://jisho.org/search/会う)</span>, both of which you've hopefully seen. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [出](https://jisho.org/search/出)</span> portion may be confusing, but you can usually assume that if one part of the word is kun'yomi / vocab reading, the other part is too, which is why <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [出](https://jisho.org/search/出)</span> uses the vocab reading.<br />Oh by the way, this word can be written like this too: <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [出](https://jisho.org/search/出)合う</span>. It’s not as common, but you may come across it every now and then, so it’s good to know! 
* 出, 会
* Exit, Meet
