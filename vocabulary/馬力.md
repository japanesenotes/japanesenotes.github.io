約四年間いじくり回したおかげで、今俺の芝刈り機は450馬力もあるんだぜ。
* I tinkered with my lawnmower for about four years and now it has 450 horsepower.
* This word was probably made pretty recently. A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> horse</span>'s <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> power</span>? That is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> horsepower</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. <br />Take note that the reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [力](https://jisho.org/search/力)</span> is the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りき](https://jisho.org/search/りき)</span> version of the reading. You can remember this by thinking about how it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ricky</span> who drives the high <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> horsepower</span> cars. Vroom vroom Ricky!
