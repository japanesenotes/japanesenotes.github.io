## Mnemonics:
ガレージで、古いパンツをみつけた。
* I found an old pair of underwear in our garage.
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> old</span>? It's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> old</span>.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji with some hiragana attached, it's going to use the kun'yomi reading. You learned the on'yomi when learning the kanji portion, so let's use a mnemonic to help you with the reading of this word: <br />If you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> old</span>, you're also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> full</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふる](https://jisho.org/search/ふる)</span>) of memories. And you're probably full of old secrets. And you're full from old people food.
