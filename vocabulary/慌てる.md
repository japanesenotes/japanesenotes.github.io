## Mnemonics:
慌てず、慎重にね。
* Don't hurry, do it carefully.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> confused</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bewildered</span> but this is usually just used when someone starts <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to panic</span>. They're so confused and bewildered that they try <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to hurry</span> through things.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />Whenever you start <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to panic</span> you can't help but blurt out, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> A wha-</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あわ](https://jisho.org/search/あわ)</span>)? to everything people say and ask. For example, Would you like a mint? A WHA?! Yeah, you really do sound upset.
