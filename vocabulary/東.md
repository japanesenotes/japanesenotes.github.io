## Mnemonics:
空港の東側に住んでいます。
* I live on the east side of the airport.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />You see a man walking <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> east</span>, toward the sun rising behind that tree, but it's too bright. He trips and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> he gash</span>es (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひがし](https://jisho.org/search/ひがし)</span>) his foot on a root that was sticking out of the ground. His foot is torn up really bad, but he tries to take another step and, oh no, he gashes his foot again! This guy is not having an easy time going east.
* 東
* East
* [sound:東_b.mp3]
