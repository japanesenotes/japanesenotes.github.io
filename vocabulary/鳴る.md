## Mnemonics:
雷が鳴ったが、雨は降らなかった。
* Thunder rumbled but it didn’t rain.
* This is a lot like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [鳴く](https://jisho.org/search/鳴く)</span>, which means to chirp (or some other animal noise). This has to do with noises too, but not so much animal and more like bells (including telephones). This word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to ring</span>. If it helps, think of the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span> as a hint, kind of like the first sound of the word ring (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span>). So, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span> = ring and it's a verb, so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to ring</span>.
* The reading can come from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [鳴く](https://jisho.org/search/鳴く)</span>. So long as you know the reading for that word you can know the reading for this word as well.
* 鳴
* Chirp
* [sound:鳴る_b.mp3]
* [sound:鳴る_g.mp3]
