## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Thing</span>s with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> value</span> have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prices</span>. This is just the general prices of things.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶつ](https://jisho.org/search/ぶつ)</span> changes to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶっ](https://jisho.org/search/ぶっ)</span>, though, so hopefully that doesn't change the price you're willing to pay for this vocab? Right? Please give me your money.
* 物, 価
