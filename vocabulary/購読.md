## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> subscription</span> has been <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> read</span>. Each magazine that comes in you read. This is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> subscription</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Since you didn't learn the on'yomi for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [読](https://jisho.org/search/読)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [どく](https://jisho.org/search/どく)</span>) with the kanji, here's a mnemonic to help you out. You just got a subscription to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [どく](https://jisho.org/search/どく)</span>) magazine. It's all about docks and dock related things. How exciting.
