## Mnemonics:
ぼくのはつこいの女の子は、にんじんがきらいだった。
* The girl who was my first love didn’t like carrots.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana stuck in the middle you can guess that it is like putting two separate words that you've learned together into one word. This hiragana is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [の](https://jisho.org/search/の)</span>, a particle that makes something possessive. In this case, the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span> is of the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [女](https://jisho.org/search/女)</span>. Basically, this suggests that the woman is a child, aka a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> girl</span>.
* Since there's hiragana in here, you can bet that these kanji will use the kun'yomi readings. You already know the kun'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 女</span>. The only thing I have to make sure that you know is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span>. When you need to remember the kun'yomi reading of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span>, just think about you fighting a child (you're a jerk, apparently!). When you hit him in the face, he flies to the floor, and the ref calls out <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> KO</span>! because you just knocked the poor kid out.
* 女, 子
* Woman, Child
