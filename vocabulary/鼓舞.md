* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beat</span> makes you want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dance</span>. It's the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inspiration</span> you need to dance. The beat gives you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> encouragement</span> to dance all night long. And without such a rockin' beat you would have lame dance moves.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
