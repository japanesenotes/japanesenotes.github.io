## Mnemonics:

* 
* Go ahead and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> extend</span> it and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stretch</span> it. That's how we'll do this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> enlargement</span>.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. Of course, just to be dirty, the people who made up this word decided to use a kanji that read as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かく](https://jisho.org/search/かく)</span>. Dirty old monks that could see the future and speak English, ugh.
* 拡, 張
* Extend, Stretch
