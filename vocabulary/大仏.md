## Mnemonics:
「彼女、大仏さんと付き合っているのよ。」「とても信じられないわね。だって、彼女の父親と言ってもいいくらい年上でしょ？」
* She’s dating Mr. Giant Buddha Statue. You could have fooled me. He's old enough to be her father.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> large</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Buddha</span> doesn't make sense if you don't know the context. There are giant statues of Buddha, and these are called Daibutsu, making this word translate to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Giant Buddha Statue</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 大, 仏
* Big, Buddha
