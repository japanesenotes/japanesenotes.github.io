## Mnemonics:
あの留学生、いつも私と彼氏の写真に変顔とか変なポーズで写り込んでくるんだけど。ちょっとうざいんだよね。
* That exchange student is always photobombing pictures of my boyfriend and me. It’s kind of annoying.
* Remember <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [留学](https://jisho.org/search/留学)</span>, which means study abroad? Do you also remember <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [学生]([学](https://jisho.org/search/学)生)</span>, which is student? This word is like those two words mashed together (they share a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [学](https://jisho.org/search/学)</span>), making it a study abroad student. What's a better way to say that? How about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exchange student</span>!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 留, 学, 生
* Detain, Study, Life
* [sound:留学生_b.mp3]
