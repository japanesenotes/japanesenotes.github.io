## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> manipulate</span>, so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to manipulate</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: A guy using <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eye arts</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あやつ](https://jisho.org/search/あやつ)</span>) isn't a great guy, it's the type of guy who might try <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to manipulate</span> you via hypnosis of the eyes.
