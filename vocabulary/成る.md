## Mnemonics:
うわーー！！コウイチがとうとうアメリカ大統領に成ったよ。「為せば成る。為さねばならぬ何事も、成らぬは人の為さぬなりけり」だね！
* Oh my God! Koichi finally became the President of the United States! Where there's a will, there's a way!
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> become</span> so the vocab verb version would be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to become</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You are starting <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to become</span> something else. You're transforming, but you're not sure what it is. First, you get fins... uh oh, something in the water. Then, you gain a tail and rubbery skin... hmm, something sea mammal-like. Oh, and then a huge horn flies out of your nose. You are going to become a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> na</span>rwhal (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [な](https://jisho.org/search/な)</span>).
