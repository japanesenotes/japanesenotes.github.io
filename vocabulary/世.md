## Mnemonics:
暗殺者は別にして、スズメ蜂ほど怖いものはこの世の中にない。
* Other than assassins, nothing in this world is scarier than wasps.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. Here's a mnemonic to help you to remember it: <br />Since you have generations of people making up this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> world</span>, think of the rapper generation. What do they say all the time (obviously I don't know anything about rap)? They say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Yo</span> yo yo! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よ](https://jisho.org/search/よ)</span>).
* 世
* World
* [sound:世_b.mp3]
* [sound:世_g.mp3]
