## Mnemonics:
これって、すごく不公平だわ！ ミドリは私が欲しいものを全部手に入れて、その上私のパパとママが親じゃないだなんて！
* This is so unfair! Midori gets everything that I want. And, on top of that, she doesn’t have my mom and dad for parents.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />Just imagine your parents saying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> oh yah</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おや](https://jisho.org/search/おや)</span>) over and over at you. What did you do at school today? I beat up this kid. Oh yah?
* 親
* Parent
* [sound:親_b.mp3]
* [sound:親_g.mp3]
