## Mnemonics:

* 
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> marrow</span> of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reality</span> is the true <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> essence</span> of life. If you look deep down into reality you might even find the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> true meaning</span> of life! Hmm I wonder what that is... it probably has something to do with a certain two digit number. Oh well.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
* 真, 髄
