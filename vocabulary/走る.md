## Mnemonics:
人生走り続けるより、侍に首をはねられる方がずっとましだという結論に達しました。
* I’ve come to the conclusion that having my head cut off by a samurai would be much worse than running for my life.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> run</span> so now you know the verb version of that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to run</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はし](https://jisho.org/search/はし)</span> portion. Think of yourself running. It's nice. As you run, though, you notice the ground changing into something weird and mushy. Everything is turning into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hash</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はし](https://jisho.org/search/はし)</span>) browns. You start to get sucked in, and soon you can't run anymore. Smell the hash browns and taste them too. What a terrible run this was.
