## Mnemonics:
誰かの伝があるといいんだけど。
* But I think some kind of intermediary would be good.
* When you get someone to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> transmit</span> information, they're a type of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> intermediary</span>, a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> go-between</span>, if you will.
* When a vocab word is a single kanji with no okurigana, it takes the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn this one yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember: <br />When the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> go-between</span> gets back and is about to tell you everything the other group said, it takes him <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two ta</span>kes (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つて](https://jisho.org/search/つて)</span>) to get it all right. The other group had a lot to say and he had trouble getting it all on the first take, but he totally nailed it on the second.
* 伝
* Transmit
* [sound:伝_b.mp3]
* [sound:伝_g.mp3]
