## Mnemonics:
もう忘れなって。過ぎてしまったことは今さらどうにもならないんだから。
* Forget about it. It’s water under the bridge.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> forget</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to forget</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Wait, what <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> was</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わす](https://jisho.org/search/わす)</span>) the reading? I <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> forget</span>... What was it?
