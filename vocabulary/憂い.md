## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, but wait! It's not an adjective, it's just a noun (tricky, tricky). The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grief</span>, so this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grief</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> distress</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading when you learned <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [憂える](https://jisho.org/search/憂える)</span>. Remember that and you'll remember this!
* 憂
* Grief
* [sound:憂い_b.mp3]
* [sound:憂い_g.mp3]
