## Mnemonics:
フグさん、そっとつねって下さいね。
* Fugu, gently pinch me please.
* You know that the kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [下](https://jisho.org/search/下)</span> means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> down</span> and that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さい](https://jisho.org/search/さい)</span> sounds like the word sigh. You need to ask someone for something, so you look down, sigh, and say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> please give me</span> that thing. You're ashamed that you have to ask. But you still need it. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Please</span>, please give it to me!<br />We only use this kanji version of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ください]([くだ](https://jisho.org/search/くだ)さい)</span> when we're asking for something, that's why it's please give me. If you're just saying please you don't need the kanji at all!
* The reading for this word is an exceptional reading. You just have to be able to recall the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くだ](https://jisho.org/search/くだ)</span> part, though (since <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さい](https://jisho.org/search/さい)</span> is already there in the form of the hiragana). So, think about why you have to be polite to this misbehaving kid. Turns out, if you don't, he has the power to initiate a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Coup d'é</span>tat against you and your family, who runs the government. Just imagine yourself thinking over and over Okay... I have to be nice to this kid. If I don't... he'll initiate a Coup d'état... and that would ruin my family... You're walking on thin ice, here.
