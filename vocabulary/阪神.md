## Mnemonics:
うわぁ、阪神タイガースのファンたち、恵比寿橋からあの汚い川にダイブしたんだって？すげぇな、あいつらの頭大丈夫かよ！
* Oh my God! Hanshin Tigers fans dived off the Ebisu bridge down into the dirty river? Wow, they are nuts!
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> slope</span>s of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> god</span>s! What could this be? Well, it's mainly just a company, known as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Hanshin</span>. They're based in the area between Osaka and Kobe. Think of it this way: <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [大阪](https://jisho.org/search/大阪)</span> + <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [神戸](https://jisho.org/search/神戸)</span> = <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [阪神](https://jisho.org/search/阪神)</span>! They're everywhere, though, and even have a baseball team (the Hanshin Tigers), so it's good to know.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 阪, 神
* Heights, God
