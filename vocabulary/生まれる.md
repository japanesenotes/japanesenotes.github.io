## Mnemonics:
生まれたばかりの子どもに、さけをのませるな。
* Do not make a newborn baby drink alcohol.
* Since this is a kanji with hiragana attached that ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know that this word is a verb. What's the ultimate verb version of the kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [生](https://jisho.org/search/生)</span>? That would have to be phrased <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be born</span>. You can distinguish this one from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [生](https://jisho.org/search/生)む</span> because this word is longer. Why is it longer? Because to be born must be a horrifying feeling. Although giving birth must be painful too, just imagine how long and terrifying getting born must be. That's why it feels longer.
* You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> part of this word to read it. To remember that, let's use a mnemonic: <br />Just imagine someone being born. All they do is scream: UUUUUuuUuuUUUuuuUUUuu (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span>) the whole time. Go ahead and imagine yourself being born and doing the same thing. Say UUUuuUUuuu out loud to help you to remember.
* 生
* Life
* [sound:生まれる_b.mp3]
* [sound:生まれる_g.mp3]
