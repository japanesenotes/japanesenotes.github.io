## Mnemonics:

* 
* You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> each</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> each</span> which is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> each</span> (or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> every</span>, or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> respectively</span>). Kind of goes along the lines of each and every in English.
* The reading is weird. So sorry. Just imagine you look at <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> each</span> item. Every single one is messed up in some way. Possibly they are robots all accidentally programmed to need to kill humans. You say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> oh no oh no</span> in quick succession because this is a bad situation.
* 各, 々
* Each, Repeater
