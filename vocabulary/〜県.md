## Mnemonics:
今まで日本の何県に行ったことがあるの？
* Which prefectures in Japan have you been to?
* Attach this word onto the end of a prefecture place name and you have the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prefecture</span> portion of _____ <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prefecture</span>. These are a lot like states or provinces.
* The reading for this is the same as what you learned with the kanji, probably because it's always attached to things (so it's like jukugo). Don't write the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [〜](https://jisho.org/search/〜)</span> when you're writing in the answer, just the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けん](https://jisho.org/search/けん)</span> portion, and you'll get this one correct.
* 県
* Prefecture
* [sound:〜県_b.mp3]
* [sound:〜県_g.mp3]
