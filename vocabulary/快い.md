## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pleasant</span>? It is also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pleasant</span>.
* This word's reading is pretty weird. We're going to think back to a couple different words to put this one together. The word for heart (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [心](https://jisho.org/search/心)</span>), is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こころ](https://jisho.org/search/こころ)</span>. The word for good is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よい](https://jisho.org/search/よい)</span> (or <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)い</span>, but for this word's sake, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よい](https://jisho.org/search/よい)</span>). A good heart (feeling) is one where your heart feels nice and warm and fuzzy (figuratively, not literally. If it's literal, go to the hospital please). That is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pleasant</span> feeling. A <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こころ](https://jisho.org/search/こころ)よい</span> feeling.
