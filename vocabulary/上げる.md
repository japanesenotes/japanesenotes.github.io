## Mnemonics:
りょうてを上に上げて、大きくおならをした。
* I raised my hands and let out a huge fart.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> above</span> so the verb version of that is when you put something above you. It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to raise something</span>.<br />This is a transitive verb. That means it takes a direct object. You raise something. Like your hands!
* Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to use the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to raise</span> an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a</span>ardvark (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あ](https://jisho.org/search/あ)</span>) above your head. Why? Because even though aardvarks have long tongues, it can't reach the ants in the trees. But when you raise the aardvark it can get at those yummy ants!
