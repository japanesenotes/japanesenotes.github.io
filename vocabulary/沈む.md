## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sink</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to sink</span>. You know this is when something is just sinking on its own (you didn't sink it), because of the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [む](https://jisho.org/search/む)</span>, which shows it's a cow sinking. The cow stepped into some quicksand and now it's sinking, not because of you.
* You look at the cow. Poor cow. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> She's</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しず](https://jisho.org/search/しず)</span>) sinking.
* 沈
* Sink
* [sound:沈む_b.mp3]
* [sound:沈む_g.mp3]
