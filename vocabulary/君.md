## Mnemonics:
君は、エレベーターで一緒に閉じ込められたくない人ナンバーワンだ。
* You are the worst person to be stuck with in an elevator.
* Okay, so the kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> buddy</span> and so does the word, but it also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> you</span> as well. This is one of the several ways to say you in Japanese, and this one is kind of an affectionate you. Maybe you'd say it with someone you're close to. Maybe you'd say it with a girlfriend or boyfriend. You wouldn't want to use it with your boss or teacher, though. Make sure to keep that in mind. It's kind of like saying hey buddy or hey you, after all.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />Who's your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> buddy</span>? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kimmy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きみ](https://jisho.org/search/きみ)</span>)! If you know a Kimmy, imagine her. If you don't, find a famous Kimmy or make up a Kimmy to imagine. You ask... is it you?? Wait, you're my buddy?
* 君
* Buddy
