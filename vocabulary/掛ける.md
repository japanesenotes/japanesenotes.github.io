## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hang</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to hang</span>. This is when you hang something, like a picture. You can remember this because you don't really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> care</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ける](https://jisho.org/search/ける)</span>) about where you hang it, as long as you're the one to do it.
* The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji.
* 掛
* Hang
* [sound:掛ける_b.mp3]
* [sound:掛ける_g.mp3]
