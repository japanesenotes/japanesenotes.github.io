## Mnemonics:
ビエトはコウイチに、マミはみんなの想像の斜め上を行く変人だと告げた。
* Viet told Koichi that Mami is much weirder than everyone imagined.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> announce</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to announce</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: I'd like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to announce</span>... we're not having one baby, we're having <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>) babies!
* 告
* Announce
