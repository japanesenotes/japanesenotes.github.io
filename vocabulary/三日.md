三月三日はひなまつりです。
* The third day of March is Girl’s Day.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Third day</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> day three</span>. No matter how you look at this word, it makes a lot of sense.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Counting days, however, are an exception (at least up to ten). You need to use the kun'yomi readings to read this word. You already know the kun'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [三](https://jisho.org/search/三)</span> from when you learned the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [三](https://jisho.org/search/三)つ</span>. Here is a way to remember the reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [日](https://jisho.org/search/日)</span>:<br />On the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> third day</span> you have to give <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> me</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [み](https://jisho.org/search/み)</span>) a ride in your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> car</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>). I don't have a car of my own, so don't forget me, okay?
* 三, 日
* Three, Sun
* [sound:三日_b.mp3]
* [sound:三日_g.mp3]
