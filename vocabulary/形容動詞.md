* A <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [形容詞](https://jisho.org/search/形容詞)</span> is an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> adjective</span>. So what about an adjective with a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [動詞](https://jisho.org/search/動詞)</span> (verb) in there? How does that make sense? I'm not entirely sure either, but an adjective with movement in it is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> na adjective</span>. These are the adjectives that can end with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [な](https://jisho.org/search/な)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [便利な](https://jisho.org/search/便利な)</span>, for example). In fact, they're more like nouns than they are verbs, so what gives? Whatever it is, just decide you don't want to deal with this craziness. Just say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nah</span>, I don't care about this anymore.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. It will help to know <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [形容詞](https://jisho.org/search/形容詞)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [動詞](https://jisho.org/search/動詞)</span> as well, since they're both parts of this word.
