* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* The kanji and the vocab are exactly the same, even the reading. This one uses the on'yomi probably because it's often attached to other words (specifying a bureau, for example), so that's why it follows jukugo conventions despite being all alone.
