## Mnemonics:
東大に受かったなんて、凄いじゃないですか！
* That's wonderful that you got accepted by Tokyo University!
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> amazing</span>? It's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> amazing</span>! Or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> terrible</span>. This word can be both good and bad, it really depends on the context, because what is amazing is usually also a little awful. You know? 
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />The most <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> amazing</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> terrible</span> thing you've ever seen is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Su</span>it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Go</span>dzilla (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すご](https://jisho.org/search/すご)</span>). Godzilla was wearing a nice suit (amazing!) but also destroying your home, your friends, and your family (terrible!).
