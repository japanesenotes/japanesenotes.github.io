## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are almost exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />When things are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sparse</span>, you won't have food or toys or internet. It's hard for everyone. So your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ma</span>ma would <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> baa</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まば](https://jisho.org/search/まば)</span>) to entertain you and get you to stop thinking about how thin you and her were getting. Mama baaing made you calm and happy. Thanks mama.
