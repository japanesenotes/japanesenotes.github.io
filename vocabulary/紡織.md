## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Spinning</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> weaving</span> means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spinning and weaving</span>. Yay!
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [織](https://jisho.org/search/織)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />While you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spinning and weaving</span> you are always absolutely <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shock</span>ed (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょく](https://jisho.org/search/しょく)</span>) by what you make. You never really know when you start and then BAM! You made elephant slippers. That's just how it works and it shocks you every single time.
* 紡, 織
