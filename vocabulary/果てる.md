## Mnemonics:
いつ果てるともなく続く会議に、社員は全員ウンザリしていた。
* The meeting continued without any sign of ending and the employees were getting fed up.
* If you tear (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てる](https://jisho.org/search/てる)</span>) up a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fruit</span>, its life is going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to end</span>. Fruit can't go on when they've been beaten up so much. 
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />The fruit's life is about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to end</span> and you laugh, Hahahaha (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span>)! And then you start tearing at it more! What's wrong with you? Weirdo...
* 果
* Fruit
* [sound:果てる_b.mp3]
* [sound:果てる_g.mp3]
