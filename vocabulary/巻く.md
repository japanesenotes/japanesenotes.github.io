## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scroll</span>. But, you don't to scroll. What do you do to scrolls, though? You roll them up, making this word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to roll</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to roll up</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: The thing you are rolling up is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ma</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ま](https://jisho.org/search/ま)</span>). She's going wild again, so you throw her into a blanket and roll her up to hold her down.
