## Mnemonics:

* 
* This looks like an adjective, but it's actually a noun. This word is the same as the kanji meaning: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> vow</span> (or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> oath</span>).
* This has the same reading as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [近い](https://jisho.org/search/近い)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちかい](https://jisho.org/search/ちかい)</span>). Just think about how when you're making a vow or oath, you become closer to the thing or person you're vowing to. You belong to them, in a way, which is why you become <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> close</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [近い](https://jisho.org/search/近い)</span>).
