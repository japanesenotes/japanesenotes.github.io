チーズベーコンバーガー通りには、ガソリンスタンドってあったっけ？
* Were there any gas stations on Bacon Cheeseburger Avenue?
* You know the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [通る](https://jisho.org/search/通る)</span> hopefully by now. That is the verb version of this word, which means to pass through. So, if this is the noun version, what is it that you use to pass through something? To drive or walk along? That would be an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> avenue</span> (or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> street</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> road</span>, etc). This is a pretty common word in Japan, and good for not getting lost.
* The reading is the same as the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [通る](https://jisho.org/search/通る)</span>, so as long as you know that, you should be able to read this one as well. Mind the strange long <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)</span> sound!
* 通
* Pass Through
* [sound:通り_b.mp3]
* [sound:通り_g.mp3]
