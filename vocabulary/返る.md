## Mnemonics:
貸したお金がちゃんと返ってくると思ったら大間違いよ。
* Thinking my money would be returned properly was a huge mistake.
* You hopefully know the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [返す](https://jisho.org/search/返す)</span>, which means to return (as in, you're doing the direct action of returning something). This word, on the other hand, is the version where something just returns (and you're not doing the action of returning). Use the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span> to help you to remember this. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span> the Kangaroo is returned to you. You don't do any of the returning, it just happens or someone else does it. That's why this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be returned</span>.
* The reading is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [返す](https://jisho.org/search/返す)</span>, so as long as you know that you'll be able to apply it here to learn the reading of this word as well.
* 返
* Return
