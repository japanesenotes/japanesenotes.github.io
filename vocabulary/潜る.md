## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> conceal</span>, but the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to pass through</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to pass under</span>. Technically, you're concealed, but it's a little more active. You're passing through unnoticed, or passing under something. You're evading.
* Why are you trying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to pass through</span> without getting seen? Because there's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> couga</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くぐ](https://jisho.org/search/くぐ)</span>) hunting you, and if it sees you... well... you're dead meat.
