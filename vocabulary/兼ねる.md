## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> concurrently</span>, but since you can't to concurrently, we're going to have to come up with another word to use: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to combine</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to double as</span>. Since this kanji has to do with something having a dual purpose, we can say that something can combine as being another thing, or double as being another thing, which is where these words come from.
* For example, a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>) can double as a place to sleep at night when not enough people become members of WaniKani.
