## Mnemonics:

* 
* In order to use a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> house counter</span> in the first place, you need to have something to count. That's why you have to find <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eaves</span>. And all those eaves together <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stand in a row</span>.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: <br />These houses that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stand in a row</span> are neat and fun to count, but you can't go in because you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> no key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [のき](https://jisho.org/search/のき)</span>). With no key, those <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eaves</span> are just there for you to look at.
