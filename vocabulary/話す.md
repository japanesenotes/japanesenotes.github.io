## Mnemonics:
あなたが話すのを聞いていると、なぜかいつも、紐無しで橋からバンジー・ジャンプをしているような気になります。
* Every time I hear you speak, I feel like jumping off of a bridge without a bungee cord for some reason.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> talk</span> so the verb version of this is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to talk</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to speak</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Every time you try <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to speak</span>, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [花](https://jisho.org/search/花)</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はな](https://jisho.org/search/はな)</span>) just sprout out of your mouth preventing you. Imagine your mouth full of flowers. Taste them, spit them out, and try to speak again. Same problem.
* 話
* Talk
* [sound:話す_b.mp3]
* [sound:話す_g.mp3]
