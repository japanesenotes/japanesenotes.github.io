布団の勧誘って、何であんなにしつこいのかなぁ。何度来られても買わないものは買わないっつうの。ほんと、鬱陶しい！
* I’m getting sick of these futon salespeople. Can’t they understand that if I don’t buy something after several visits, that I’m never going to buy it? So annoying.
* This one's a little weird. You have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> group</span> of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cloth</span>. Think about this. If you group together a bunch of cloth into one big cloth, you have something nice and soft. What can you use this nice and soft cloth things for? Well, you can sleep on it. This is the Japanese word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> futon</span>, which you may have heard in English before (though the Japanese futon is quite different from the American one). You can also translate this to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bedding</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sleeping mat</span> too.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [団](https://jisho.org/search/団)</span> is the secondary reading that went with the kanji, though, so watch out for that. If you can figure out the meaning of this word, chances are you already know how to spell it, so carry that over to Japanese.
* 布, 団
* Cloth, Group
