## Mnemonics:
スミス先生、生徒が二人足りません。数えましたが38人しかいないんです。
* There are two students missing, Mr. Smith. I only counted thirty-eight children.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> count</span>, so obviously the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to count</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You begin <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to count</span> vocabulary words. You're out of control and you can't stop. One after another. Scientists have to come in, but they can't figure out the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cause</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かぞ](https://jisho.org/search/かぞ)</span>) of your counting. They drag you away to a padded cell where they keep testing you trying to figure out the cause of your craziness.
