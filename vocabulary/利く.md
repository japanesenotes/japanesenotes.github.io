## Mnemonics:
コウイチは中々融通の利く男だ。
* Koichi is a pretty flexible man.
* You know the kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> profit</span>. When you make it into a verb, though, it means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to work well</span>. If you think about it, when something works well it makes you a profit.
* What works so well? Your special <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>) that can unlock anyone and anything's potential. Imagine putting it into a key slot in someone's back. Someone who's a good for nothing can't-do-anything is now an effective member of society! Go around using your key on other non-effective things and show them that anything is possible!
