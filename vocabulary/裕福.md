## Mnemonics:
僕の両親はド金持ちって訳じゃないけど、比較的裕福な方ではあります。
* My parents are not super rich but they are relatively wealthy.
* You have such <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> abundant</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> luck</span>! When you have abundant luck, most people probably would think you also have a lot of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wealth</span>, because lots of wealth equals lots of luck, right?
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 裕, 福
