## Mnemonics:
わたしは円い月がこわい。
* I’m afraid of the full moon.
* This word is made up of a single kanji with hiragana attached to it. That hiragana ends with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> which means it's an adjective. So, what's the adjective form of the kanji that's in this word? <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [円](https://jisho.org/search/円)</span> means both yen and round but in this case we're looking at the round one (because something isn't going to be yenny). The adjective version of round is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> round</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> circular</span>. Just like a yen coin, this round is a flat round. As in, if you draw a circle on a piece of paper, you could use this word. Same goes with yen, which is why yen and round both use the same kanji.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />The reading for the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [円](https://jisho.org/search/円)</span> portion of this word is the same as a kanji you're learning in this level: <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [丸](https://jisho.org/search/丸)</span>. That kanji means something really similar to this kanji. And guess what? They also share a reading. So, if you know that the reading of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [丸](https://jisho.org/search/丸)</span> is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まる](https://jisho.org/search/まる)</span> then you'll also know that the reading for this word is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> まる</span>!
