* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> order</span> of things is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> preface</span> to the entire <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sequence</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> steps</span> we're planning on taking. So, just remember. The order is just the preface. It is what allows us to come up with a sequence.
