## Mnemonics:
もう！まとわりつくのは止めてよ！集中できないでしょ。
* Hey! Stop breathing down my neck. I can’t concentrate.
* When you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> collect</span> to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> middle</span> of yourself, you are collecting towards your brain. All energy is going towards there, massing up in the middle, giving you extreme <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> concentration</span> abilities. <br />Just imagine a light in the middle of your brain, so concentrated that you're able to concentrate, shooting a little laser out of your forehead onto the thing you're concentrating on.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 集, 中
* Collect, Middle
