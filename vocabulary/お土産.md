## Mnemonics:

* 
* Are you visiting a neat place? Grab some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dirt</span> and bring it back with you. Then pretend to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> give birth</span> to it in front of your friends. That dirt is now a special <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> souvenir</span>! It's the best <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> present</span> you could ever give someone!
* These readings are exceptions, sorry! Here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />When someone asks you who gave you a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> souvenir</span>, just say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Miya ga</span>ve (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みやげ](https://jisho.org/search/みやげ)</span>) it to me. Who's Miya? No idea. But neither do they. You never have to remember who gave you anything ever again! Miya gave you everything you own. She's probably a great person.
* 土, 産
* Dirt, Give Birth
