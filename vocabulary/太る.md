## Mnemonics:
太れば太るほど、わたしはおなかがすく。
* The fatter I get, the hungrier I become.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fat</span> so the verb form of that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to get fat</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You have to learn the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふと](https://jisho.org/search/ふと)</span> portion of this word to be able to read it. Here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You're getting fat so quickly that you can see your body expanding. You look down - at first you can see your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foot</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふと](https://jisho.org/search/ふと)</span>) but then a second later you can't. You can't see your foot because you're getting fat, even when you stick your foot way out. What's going on?
* 太
* Fat
* [sound:太る_b.mp3]
* [sound:太る_g.mp3]
