## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> based on</span> and the verb means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be due to</span>. This is probably because when something is based off something, it does something else, which is due to what it was based on. It was caused by what it was based on.
* For example, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>gurt is due to milk. If milk didn't exist, neither would yogurt.
