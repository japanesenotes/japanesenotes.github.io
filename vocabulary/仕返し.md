## Mnemonics:
プリンを食べられた仕返しに、コウイチの大すきなヨーグルトを食べてやった。
* I ate Koichi's favorite yogurt to get back at him for eating my pudding.
* When you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> return</span> the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> doing</span>s of another person, you're doing it to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> get even</span> (whether it's a nice thing or a mean thing).
* The readings are a bit weird, here. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [仕](https://jisho.org/search/仕)</span> gets its on'yomi reading... you should be okay with that. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [返し](https://jisho.org/search/返し)</span> gets the kun'yomi reading, though, which is the reading you saw with the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [返す](https://jisho.org/search/返す)</span> in level 9. You can tell this part uses the kun'yomi vocab reading because it has that hiragana attached to it. Just remember to distinguish between the two parts of the word to remember the readings.
* 仕, 返
* Doing, Return
* [sound:仕返し_b.mp3]
* [sound:仕返し_g.mp3]
