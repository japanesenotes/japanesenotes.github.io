## Mnemonics:
「それは本当にいい考えだね。そうしよう。」「よし、じゃあ、それで話は決まりだ。」
* That’s a really good idea. Let’s do that. Okay, then it’s been decided.
* You've seen the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [決める](https://jisho.org/search/決める)</span> before, hopefully. This is similar, except for instead of doing the action of deciding, something has just been decided (by something or someone else). You are not the decision maker, here. That's why this word is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be decided</span>.
* The reading is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [決める](https://jisho.org/search/決める)</span>, so make sure you know that word so you can apply that knowledge over here.
* 決
* Decide
* [sound:決まる_b.mp3]
* [sound:決まる_g.mp3]
