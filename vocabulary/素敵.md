## Mnemonics:

* 
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> element</span> of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> enemy</span> isn't something you should think of as bad. You have to have the enemy element if you are to have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lovely</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dreamy</span>, and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beautiful</span> things too. This is a good word when you're talking about some dude you think is hawt. Doesn't work as well with girls.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [素](https://jisho.org/search/素)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />Oh wow, you look really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lovely</span> in that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> su</span>it (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span>). Yes, I can see you through the Internet, and I have to say, that suit is just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dreamy</span>! Don't ever take it off.
* 素, 敵
