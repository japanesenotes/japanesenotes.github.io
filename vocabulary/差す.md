## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> distinction</span>. To distinct something would be nice, but this is used more like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to shine at</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to shine on</span>, like when a light shines on someone on a stage, distinguishing them from everyone else.
* The reading of the kanji is actually the same as the reading for this word, making things easy (both on'yomi and kun'yomi are <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)</span>).
* 差
* Distinction
* [sound:差す_b.mp3]
* [sound:差す_g.mp3]
