## Mnemonics:
あなたからのメール、文字化けしちゃったみたいなんだけど、何て書いてたの？
* It looks like that email from you contained corrupted characters, what did you write?
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> writing</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> letter</span> is simpler than it sounds. It's really just a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> letter</span>, right? You're reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [文字]([文](https://jisho.org/search/文)字)</span> right now, in fact!
* The reading for this word is just the jukugo, but the reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [文](https://jisho.org/search/文)</span> is a little bit modified. Instead of the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もん]([も](https://jisho.org/search/も)ん)</span>, which you learned with the kanji, it's just <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [も](https://jisho.org/search/も)</span>. You can remember this because you're shortening this word in a way as well. The writing letter is shortened to letter. So, think of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もん]([も](https://jisho.org/search/も)ん)</span> being shortened to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [も](https://jisho.org/search/も)</span>.
