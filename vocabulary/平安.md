* Walking through the old growth forests in British Columbia was so peaceful.
* Something is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flat</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> relax</span>ed. That is you. What words does that describe? To me, that would be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> peace</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tranquility</span>. Just imagine something that is flat and relaxed, like a field of grass with happy people in it. It's so peaceful! It's so tranquil!
