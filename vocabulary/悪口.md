## Mnemonics:
友達がみんなで私の悪口を言っているのを聞いちゃったんだよね。
* I heard that all of my friends were saying bad things about me.
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bad</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mouth</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> saying bad things</span> (as usual!). Everything that comes out of this bad mouth of yours is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> verbal abuse</span>. One day someone's going to pop you in that bad mouth of yours.
* The reading is the kun'yomi vocab readings for these two kanji, probably because this word is just two words put together into one (bad + mouth). Use your knowledge of the vocab words <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [悪い](https://jisho.org/search/悪い)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [口](https://jisho.org/search/口)</span> to learn the reading of this word.<br />Okay, I lied. You can also do <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わるぐち](https://jisho.org/search/わるぐち)</span> if you want. Sorry to say such bad things before.
* 悪, 口
* Bad, Mouth
* [sound:悪口_b.mp3]
* [sound:悪口_g.mp3]
