## Mnemonics:

* 
* You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> one</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> muscle</span>, therefore it only does one thing. That's it. It is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> single mindedly</span> doing that one thing. It is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> intently</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> earnestly</span> doing that one thing.
* The reading is a bit weird. It's the kun'yomi readings, where <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [一](https://jisho.org/search/一)</span> is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひと](https://jisho.org/search/ひと)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [筋](https://jisho.org/search/筋)</span> is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すじ](https://jisho.org/search/すじ)</span>. Look back on the vocab words that use these readings to remember this one.
* 一, 筋
* One, Muscle
