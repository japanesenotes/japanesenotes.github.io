## Mnemonics:
惑星が太陽の周りを回るように、その子猫たちが親猫の周りを回っている。
* Those kittens revolve around their mother like the planets revolve around the sun.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> times</span>. There's no good verb for the word times but you can probably imagine something doing something over and over and over again. What word would represent this? It would be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to revolve</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have a bag of walnuts that you're bringing to a friend's house but you trip and drop them all on the ground. You shout, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Mah Wa</span>lnuts! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まわ](https://jisho.org/search/まわ)</span>) as they start <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to revolve</span> around you on the ground. Picture your walnuts going around you, getting all dirty.
