## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scary</span>? It's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scary</span>.
* You know what's really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scary</span>, like double scary (because kanji and vocab both mean scary)? How about your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cowo</span>rkers (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こわ](https://jisho.org/search/こわ)</span>). They are all insane, and you know it. Absolute nutjobs they are.
