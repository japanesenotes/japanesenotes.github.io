## Mnemonics:
平らで細長いパスタの名前覚えてない？
* Do you remember the name of the pasta that is thin, long and flat?
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same with a little hiragana sticking out. Because the hiragana doesn't really indicate what it is, it's okay to assume that they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a kanji plus some hiragana attached, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />Something is very, very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flat</span>. Perhaps someone who doesn't eat much, like a model? Which model? Let's imagine it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Tyra</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たいら](https://jisho.org/search/たいら)</span>) Banks.
