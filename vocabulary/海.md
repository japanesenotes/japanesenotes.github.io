## Mnemonics:
映画「水の世界」は、実は、海の底に住んでいる超頭のいい魚によって書かれた作品だ。
* The movie Water World was actually written by a race of super-intelligent fish that live at the bottom of the ocean.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />You visit the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sea</span>. Strangely, it asks you who is visiting. You're so full of yourself (even in front of the sea/ocean) that you reply: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> um, me</span>? (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うみ](https://jisho.org/search/うみ)</span>). Imagine yourself feeling this full of yourself.
