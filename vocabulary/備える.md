## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> provide</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to provide</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to provide</span> your friends with their own <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sauna</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そな](https://jisho.org/search/そな)</span>) because they don't want to use your shower. This requires you to go out and buy a sauna for your house (very expensive) just so you can provide your needy friends with what they want (a sauna). Feel angry you have to provide this.
