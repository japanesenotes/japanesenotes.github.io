## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> search</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to search for</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You're searching all around for a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sagger</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さが](https://jisho.org/search/さが)</span>) on your body. This is a flap of skin that is sagging on your body really far, and you probably should get it removed.
