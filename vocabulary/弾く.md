## Mnemonics:

* 
* You'd think that this means to bullet but it does not. It means to play a stringed instrument (just stringed ones). Just imagine taking a bullet and using it as a pick for a guitar, which is the stringed instrument you're playing.
* The reading is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [引く](https://jisho.org/search/引く)</span>, which is to pull. When you play a stringed instrument, you are pulling the string in a direction to make it vibrate and create a sound. So, to pull and to play a stringed instrument share a reading.
* 弾
* Bullet
* [sound:弾く_b.mp3]
* [sound:弾く_g.mp3]
