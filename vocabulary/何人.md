## Mnemonics:
夕食にはいったい何人の人がやって来るんですか？
* How many people will be joining us for dinner?
* When you ask <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> what</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> people</span> you're not actually asking what people? You're asking <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> how many people</span>. One thing you'll notice with Japanese and kanji is that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [何](https://jisho.org/search/何)</span>, when added to other things, often means how many _____ rather than what ____. Just something you have to know and experience a bit to catch on to, but you will, I believe in you.
* This word uses the kun'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [何](https://jisho.org/search/何)</span> and the on'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [人](https://jisho.org/search/人)</span>. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Take note that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [人](https://jisho.org/search/人)</span> uses its <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にん](https://jisho.org/search/にん)</span> reading here.
* 何, 人
* What, Person
* [sound:何人_b.mp3]
* [sound:何人_g.mp3]
