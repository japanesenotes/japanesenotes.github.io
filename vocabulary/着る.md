## Mnemonics:
一昨日の彼氏の誕生日会には、黒の膝丈のドレスを着ていったんだ。
* I wore a knee-length black dress at my boyfriend’s birthday party the day before yesterday.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wear</span> so this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to wear</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to put on</span>. You'll need to differentiate it from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [着く](https://jisho.org/search/着く)</span> which means (to arrive), though. Just think of how the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ru</span>de guy trying to get you to wear things you don't like wearing.
* What do you want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to wear</span> today? How about a dress made entirely of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>)? Feel the metal on your skin and the weight on your shoulders. It's not a comfortable thing to put on. Maybe just stick with wearing a single key around your neck next time.
