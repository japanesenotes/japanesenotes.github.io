## Mnemonics:

* 
* You know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [祖父](https://jisho.org/search/祖父)</span> is grandfather and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [祖母](https://jisho.org/search/祖母)</span> is grandmother. This is both combined. Is it some hybrid grandmapa monster you've created in your lab? Hardly, it just refers to your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grandparents</span>.
* The reading comes from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [祖父](https://jisho.org/search/祖父)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [祖母](https://jisho.org/search/祖母)</span>, which are exceptional readings on their own, so you'll need them in order to be able to read this one too.
* 祖, 父, 母
* Ancestor, Father, Mother
