## Mnemonics:

* 
* Something is a trouble (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [面倒](https://jisho.org/search/面倒)</span>) and it is smelly (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [臭い](https://jisho.org/search/臭い)</span>). So what is something that's smelly and a trouble? Well, something that's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> troublesome</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a bother</span>, I suppose. Basically you can ignore the smelly part. For some reason someone threw that back in, but smelly things are a bother, I suppose.
* The reading is the words <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [面倒](https://jisho.org/search/面倒)</span> plus <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [臭い](https://jisho.org/search/臭い)</span> added together. Just make sure you know those words and you'll know this one too!
* 面, 倒, 臭
* Face, Overthrow, Stinking
* [sound:面倒臭い_b.mp3]
* [sound:面倒臭い_g.mp3]
