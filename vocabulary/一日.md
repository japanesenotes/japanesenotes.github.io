## Mnemonics:
本とうに一日でこの本をよんだんですか？
* Did you really read this book in one day?
* This word has two different meanings. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> One day</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> first day</span>. No matter how you look at this word, those meanings make a lot of sense.
* The first meaning is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> one day</span>, and it has the same reading as the kanji you learned, so you should already know this reading.<br />The reading for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> first day</span>, however, is a big old exception. It doesn’t take the on’yomi or kun’yomi readings, and has its own special (weird) readings. Here’s a mnemonic to help  you remember this one:<br />On the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> first day</span> of your new relationship you can get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two touch</span>es (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ついたち](https://jisho.org/search/ついたち)</span>) only. That’s the rule! You can touch their hand and maybe high five. But that’s all you get. Just think when you’re on your first day of dating, two touches! Two touches only!
* 一, 日
* One, Sun
* [sound:一日_b.mp3]
