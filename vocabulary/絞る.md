## Mnemonics:

* 
* You've learned the word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [絞める](https://jisho.org/search/絞める)</span></span> as to strangle. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [絞る](https://jisho.org/search/絞る)</span>, however, means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to wring out</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to squeeze</span>. You can remember this one doesn't mean to strangle because a male (める) is statistically more likely to strangle someone. But you're not into strangling people, so you just try to wring out towels instead.
* This word starts with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span> just like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [絞める](https://jisho.org/search/絞める)</span>, but it has an extra <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼ](https://jisho.org/search/ぼ)</span> in there, making the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)ぼ</span>. You can remember this, because if you're going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to wring out</span> a towel, you're probably quite bored (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼ](https://jisho.org/search/ぼ)る</span>). Strangling is not a bore, though we don't recommend it.
