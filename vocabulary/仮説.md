面白いとは思うのですが、もしそれを題材に記事を書きたいのであれば、その仮説を裏付ける資料を見つけてくださいね。
* I think that’s interesting, but if you want to write an article about that topic you need to find data to prove your hypothesis.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> temporary</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> theory</span> isn't one that's set in stone yet. In fact, it's not really a theory at all, it's more of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hypothesis</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 仮, 説
* Temporary, Theory
