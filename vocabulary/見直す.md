大学の授業の選択を見直す方がいいと思うよ。だって、愚鳩を捕まえるのが、いいキャリアになるとは思えないもん。
* I think you should reevaluate your choices in university classes. I don’t think catching dodo birds is a good career path.
* You know the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [直す](https://jisho.org/search/直す)</span> from a couple levels ago. It means to fix. So, when you fix what you see, what are you doing? You're reevaluating something. That's why this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to reevaluate</span>.
* The readings are all kun'yomi readings, like the vocab you've seen already. This is like two vocab words put together, which is why it's using the kun'yomi reading. The hiragana on the end is a hint!
* 見, 直
* See, Fix
* [sound:見直す_b.mp3]
* [sound:見直す_g.mp3]
