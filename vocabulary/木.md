## Mnemonics:
あのりんごの木からおちたのは、はじめてじゃない。
* It wasn’t my first time falling from the apple tree.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:<br />You walk up to the tree. You have to get inside, because it takes you someplace secret. So, you take out your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>) and put it in the slot, opening the door in the tree so you can slip inside.
* 木
