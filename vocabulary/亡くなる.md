## Mnemonics:
もし母さんが亡くなったら、僕の料理を作ってくれる人がいなくなってしまう。
* If my mom passes away, the person who makes food for me will be gone.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. This word is actually two words put together, though. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [亡く](https://jisho.org/search/亡く)</span> means be deceased. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なる]([な](https://jisho.org/search/な)る)</span> means to become. So put that all together and you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to pass away</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to become deceased</span>. It's basically a polite way to say something died (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [死ぬ](https://jisho.org/search/死ぬ)</span>).
* To learn to read this kanji you have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [な](https://jisho.org/search/な)</span> part of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [亡く](https://jisho.org/search/亡く)</span>, though our mnemonic will use the whole thing.<br />If you're about to become deceased, you are probably <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> knock</span>ing (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [な](https://jisho.org/search/な)く</span>) on death's door.
* 亡
* Death
* [sound:亡くなる_b.mp3]
