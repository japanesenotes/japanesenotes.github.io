## Mnemonics:
一昨日、夫の不倫現場を見てしまったんです。
* The day before last I caught my husband cheating on me.
* Remember how you learned that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [昨日](https://jisho.org/search/昨日)</span> means yesterday? Well <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> one</span> day <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> previous</span> to that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> day</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> day before last</span>. 
* This reading is an exception. Let's use this mnemonic to remember it:<br />The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> day before last</span> you bought an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> O toe toy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おととい](https://jisho.org/search/おととい)</span>). It's a kid's toy in the shape of the letter O that you put on your toe. You know it was the day before last because you wore it all yesterday, and now today your toe is sore. If only you could go back to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> day before yesterday</span> to tell yourself not to buy that O toe toy! Or at least not to wear it for the whole next day!
* 一, 昨, 日
* One, Previous, Sun
