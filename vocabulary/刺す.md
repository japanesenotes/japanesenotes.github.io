## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stab</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to stab</span>.
* If you're going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to stab</span> someone, use a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> saw</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)</span>). It may seem more difficult to stab them with a saw at first, but when you see the damage, plus how hard it is to get back out, you'll realize a saw is the ideal stabbing tool.
