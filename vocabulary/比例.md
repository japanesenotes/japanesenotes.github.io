## Mnemonics:
外国語能力は、いつでも時間変化率に比例するという訳ではない。
* Foreign language ability doesn’t always improve in proportion to the rate of change.
* This is a tough one. When you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> compare</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> examples</span> (in this case of numbers) you are figuring out the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> proportion</span> / <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ratio</span>. A ratio, for example, has one number on top of another. They are examples being compared. Same with proportions. Without two things to compare, proportion doesn't make sense. That's why when you compare examples, you are dealing with proportions or ratios.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 比, 例
* Compare, Example
* [sound:比例_b.mp3]
