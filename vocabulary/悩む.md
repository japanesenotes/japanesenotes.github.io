## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> worry</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to worry</span>.
* The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji, so no need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to worry</span> about it.
* 悩
* Worry
* [sound:悩む_b.mp3]
* [sound:悩む_g.mp3]
