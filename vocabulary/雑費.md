## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Random</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> expense</span>s are miscellaneous expenses. Not actually random, but they feel that way.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ざつ](https://jisho.org/search/ざつ)</span> goes to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ざっ](https://jisho.org/search/ざっ)</span> and the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひ](https://jisho.org/search/ひ)</span> goes to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぴ](https://jisho.org/search/ぴ)</span>, making it into a dumb sounding word, like zappy (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ざっ](https://jisho.org/search/ざっ)ぴ</span>), so you can think about how some of your miscellaneous expenses were on zappy items.
