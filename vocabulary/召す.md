## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> call</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to respectfully call</span>. It can also be used as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to respectfully eat</span> or to respectfully invite too. It's a really useful word like that. As long as you remember it's the respectful/honorific way of doing things you should be fine.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />If you want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to respectfully call</span> out to someone you need to make sure you don't look them in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 目</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [め](https://jisho.org/search/め)</span>) because that's super rude. Always remember to turn your <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [目](https://jisho.org/search/目)</span> away to show respect.
