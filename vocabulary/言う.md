## Mnemonics:
ジェイクに、足を踏んでごめんって言うつもりなの？
* Are you going to say sorry to Jake for stepping on his foot?
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> say</span>, so the verb version of that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to say</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />To remember the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> we use the word eagle. <br />You're trying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to say</span> something, but every time you try to say anything an eagle swoops down and pecks at your face then flies away. Just imagine yourself saying tiny bits of words, then an eagle crashing down on your face. Then, you wait in silence. Nothing happens. You try to say something again, and the eagle swoops down on you again.
