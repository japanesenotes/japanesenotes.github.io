## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neglect</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be negligent</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to neglect</span> something.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />If you always seem <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be negligent</span> to your kids you'll end up with this situation. It's winter and your kid comes home from school covered in snow and sneezing. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Oh, coat</span>... (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おこた](https://jisho.org/search/おこた)</span>) you say. You didn't give them a coat when they went out today. Maybe if you weren't so negligent that wouldn't have happened.
