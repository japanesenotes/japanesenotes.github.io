## Mnemonics:
「ねぇ、知ってる？サラがベスと付き合ってるのよ。」「え、知らなかった。サラのこと親友だと思ってたけど、私そのこと何も聞いてないわ。」
* Hey, you know what? Sara is going out with Beth. What? I didn’t know that. I thought she was my best friend but she never told me about that.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> friend</span> who is like one of your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> parent</span>s is someone who will look out for you. They are like family, in fact! That's why this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> best friend</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> close friend</span>. Just imagine someone who watches over you like a parent would. This is the way to describe them.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 親, 友
* Parent, Friend
