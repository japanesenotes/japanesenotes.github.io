## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* The reading is different from the one you learned with the kanji. Someone waves a folding fan at you, but it just blows hot air at you. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ohh gee</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おうぎ](https://jisho.org/search/おうぎ)</span>), you say. Thanks for nothing.
