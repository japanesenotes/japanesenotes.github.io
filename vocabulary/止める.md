## Mnemonics:
かれがはしりさるのを止めるひつようがある。
* We need to stop him from running away.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stop</span> and the verb vocab version of that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to stop something</span>.<br />This particular word is when you're stopping something (i.e. doing the action of stopping it).
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to stop something</span> from moving. Maybe a car... or a door... or a person... whatever you want. To stop this thing, you throw out your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> toe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [と](https://jisho.org/search/と)</span>), getting it smashed in the process. Imagine it bleeding and swelling up. How much it hurts! You put your toe out to stop this big thing, what a mistake!
* 止
* Stop
* [sound:止める_b.mp3]
