## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember: <br /><span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Leather</span> is the skin of a cow, right? How do you say skin in Japanese? Remember <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [皮](https://jisho.org/search/皮)</span> aka <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> かわ</span>? It has the same reading as that, and they're both skin, so hopefully that makes it easier to remember.
* 革
* Leather
* [sound:革_b.mp3]
* [sound:革_g.mp3]
