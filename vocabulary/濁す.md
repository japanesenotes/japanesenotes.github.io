## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> muddy</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to make muddy</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to make cloudy</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />If you want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to make muddy</span>, meaning make yourself muddy, you should have your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> knee</span>s <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> go</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にご](https://jisho.org/search/にご)</span>) first. When you have your knees go first the mud splashes all over you but you don't hurt your hands or your butt doing it.
