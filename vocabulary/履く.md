## Mnemonics:
道路上のウンチを踏まないようにするために、人々がハイヒールを履き始めたって知ってた？
* Did you know that people started wearing high heels in order to avoid stepping on poop in the streets?
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boots</span>, but to boots doesn't make sense. What actions do you do with boots, though, usually? You put them on. That's why this word is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to put on shoes</span> (or boots, I guess). It's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to put on pants</span>, probably because it's all kind of the same motion, no?
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You decide <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to put on shoes</span>. That will teach Mrs. Chou and her streets! <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> HA</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span>) HA HA! you laugh out loud like a maniac.
