## Mnemonics:

* 
* You already learned that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [逸らす](https://jisho.org/search/逸らす)</span> means to turn away, so this means that but also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to stray</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.  You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />If you're the type of person who starts <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to stray</span> easily, you'll end up saying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sorry</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [それ](https://jisho.org/search/それ)</span>) a lot. Even if you don't do it often, if you stray, say sorry!
