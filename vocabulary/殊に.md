## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* This is the kanji followed by the particle <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [に](https://jisho.org/search/に)</span>, so it uses the kun'yomi reading like a kanji does if it's alone. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />What do you wear when it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> especially</span> cold out? Your favorite <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coat</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こと](https://jisho.org/search/こと)</span>). You only wear it when it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> unusually</span> cold though, never any other time.
