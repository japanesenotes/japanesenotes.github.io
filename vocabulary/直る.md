## Mnemonics:
農夫の壊れたトラクターは直った。
* The farmer’s broken tractor was fixed.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fix</span> so the verb version is similar to that, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be fixed</span>. This word is for when something is fixed, but you're not the one fixing it.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have to learn the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なお](https://jisho.org/search/なお)</span> part. Think of it this way. Something needs <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be fixed</span>. It's urgent! You have to fix it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> now</span>! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なお](https://jisho.org/search/なお)</span>). This will also work with the similar word, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [直す](https://jisho.org/search/直す)</span>, which you'll learn soon if you haven't already.
* 直
* Fix
* [sound:直る_b.mp3]
* [sound:直る_g.mp3]
