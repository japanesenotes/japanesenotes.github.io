## Mnemonics:

* 
* An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eternity</span> that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> far</span> away is not really an eternity, it just feels like it. It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> forever</span>, but not the real kind of forever that's actually forever. That's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [永久](https://jisho.org/search/永久)</span>, which is a real forever, this is more like whoa, I haven't eaten sushi in forever (actually, you have).
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
* 永, 遠
* Eternity, Far
* [sound:永遠_b.mp3]
* [sound:永遠_g.mp3]
