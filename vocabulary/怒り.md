## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is the noun version of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [怒る](https://jisho.org/search/怒る)</span>. So instead of being to be angry, it's just the idea and concept of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> anger</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wrath</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />I have a lot of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> anger</span> because <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> I carry</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いかり](https://jisho.org/search/いかり)</span>) all of my own things (books, luggage, drinks) and no one will ever carry them for me. Plus, the more things I carry, the more anger I carry inside. Ahh!
* 怒
* Angry
* [sound:怒り_b.mp3]
