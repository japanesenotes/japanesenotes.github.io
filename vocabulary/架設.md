## Mnemonics:

* 
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shelf</span>, once <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> establish</span>ed, makes up the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> construction</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> building</span> of the building. Just think of a building that's being built. It looks like a little shelf, doesn't it? That's important because this type of construction usually goes over something between two things, like a bridge.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
* 架, 設
* Shelf, Establish
