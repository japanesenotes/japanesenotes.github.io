## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> celebrate</span>, so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to celebrate</span>. When you burn this word, you should <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [祝う](https://jisho.org/search/祝う)</span>!
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: When you celebrate something, you have to yell out your celebrations. Yell out <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> いわう</span> three times! It's kind of like a combination of the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いい](https://jisho.org/search/いい)</span> (good) and wow. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いい](https://jisho.org/search/いい)</span>wow! <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いい](https://jisho.org/search/いい)</span>wow! Just make sure the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いい](https://jisho.org/search/いい)</span> gets shortened, because it's getting combined.
