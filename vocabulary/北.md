## Mnemonics:
北アメリカのゆうれいはとてもこわい。
* The ghosts in North America are so scary.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />You're going to the far <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> north</span> where it's very cold (north pole, perhaps?). One of the most important things you bring with you is a survival <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kit</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きた](https://jisho.org/search/きた)</span>).
* 北
