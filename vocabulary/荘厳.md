## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> villa</span> that's kept under really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> strict</span> rules will press <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> solemnity</span> on everyone who tries to stay there.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [厳](https://jisho.org/search/厳)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />To help you understand the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> solemnity</span> of a moment of silence, usually a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gon</span>g (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ごん](https://jisho.org/search/ごん)</span>) will play a few times. As you listen to the echo and silence that comes after it. The gravity of what you're being silent for really sinks in.
* 荘, 厳
* Villa, Strict
* [sound:荘厳_b.mp3]
* [sound:荘厳_g.mp3]
