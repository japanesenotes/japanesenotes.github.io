## Mnemonics:
うわっ、この青いペンキ、あの赤いペンキと全く同じ臭いがする。
* Wow, this blue paint smells exactly like the red paint.
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blue</span>? It's still <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blue</span>!
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あお](https://jisho.org/search/あお)</span> portion to read this word. Think of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blue</span> things on your body. Those are bruises. Touch them. What would you say? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> OW!</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あお](https://jisho.org/search/あお)</span>).
