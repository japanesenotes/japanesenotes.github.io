## Mnemonics:
おかあさんは、のこりのかぞくがたばになってもかなわない力をもっている。
* My mom is more powerful than the rest of my family put together.
* When a vocab word is made up of a single kanji and that's it, it almost always takes the meaning from its parent kanji. So, this vocab word also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> power</span>.
* When a vocab word is a single kanji all alone with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji), it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn the kun'yomi reading with the kanji, so for this vocab word, we'll use a mnemonic.<br />The most powerful man in the world. All his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> power</span> came from his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cheek</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちから](https://jisho.org/search/ちから)</span>). Imagine him blowing up his cheek like a giant balloon, then unleashing his power on you. Thwap thwap thwap thwap.
