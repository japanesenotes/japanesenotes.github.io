## Mnemonics:
一月にたべるアイスクリームもわるくない。
* It’s not bad to eat ice cream in January.
* Since the kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [月](https://jisho.org/search/月)</span> mean both moon and month (because a moon cycle is about a month, presumably), what is the number one month? In English we have an actual name for it, and that name is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> January</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. This is a specific month, so it uses the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がつ](https://jisho.org/search/がつ)</span> reading.
* 一, 月
* One, Moon
* [sound:一月_b.mp3]
* [sound:一月_g.mp3]
