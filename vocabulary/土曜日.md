クソ上司に土曜日も働かなきゃいけないと言われた上に、風邪をひいてしまい、さらには彼女にも振られたよ。俺の人生はクソだ。
* My stupid boss just told me that I have to work Saturday. Plus, I just caught a cold. And on top of that, my girlfriend dumped me. My life sucks.
* This is a day of the week. You know this because it has <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [曜日](https://jisho.org/search/曜日)</span> in it. But what day of the week is it? The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> earth</span> day of the week is a day you find yourself close to the earth. Either you found you drank too much on Friday, so on this day's morning you're laying right on the ground of earth. Or, maybe you just want to sleep in after staying up late on Friday. Either way, this day you lay close to the earth is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Saturday</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will help to know the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [曜日](https://jisho.org/search/曜日)</span> as well.
* 土, 曜, 日
* Dirt, Weekday, Sun
