## Mnemonics:
ほら、肉を焼く前にちゃんと筋を切っておかなかったから焼いたら縮んじゃったでしょ？
* Look, isn't it because you didn't cut the tendons before you fried it that the meat shrunk?
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well, at least on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tendon</span> side of things.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You get a horrible <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tendon</span> injury, making it so you can't walk anymore. You're so upset that you blame it on Jesus. So, you go and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue Je</span>sus for this tendon injury, and win in court, amazingly.
* 筋
* Muscle
* [sound:筋_b.mp3]
* [sound:筋_g.mp3]
