## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> multiply</span> and the verb vocab version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to multiply</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to increase</span>.
* What is multiplying? Your use of the word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fu</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>) for when you laugh. You used to say just ha ha ha like everyone else. Now the occurrences of you saying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fufufu</span> is really multiplying. You might also notice that this is similar to the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [増える](https://jisho.org/search/増える)</span>, which means to increase. This has a similar meaning and the same reading, use that to your advantage!
