## Mnemonics:
火は、かれのかみのけをぜんぶやいてしまった。
* The fire burned off all of his hair.
* This vocab is made from a single kanji, which means it shares the same meaning as the parent kanji: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fire</span>.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:<br />What comes off of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fire</span>? Lots and lots of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hea</span>t (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひ](https://jisho.org/search/ひ)</span>). Feel it coming off the fire, touching and warming your face.
