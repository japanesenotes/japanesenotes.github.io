## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> random</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boil</span> isn't all that random. It's specifically the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> new year's dish</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mochi soup</span>, eaten on new years. Old people and children tend to die every year from this (choking on the mochi), so be  careful if you eat it! Maybe the reason it's called random boil is because someone decided to boil a bunch of random things (like mochi) and then it became a new years dish later on. Who knows. That information isn't even known by the ancients.
* You learned the reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [煮](https://jisho.org/search/煮)</span> on the kanji page, but the reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [雑](https://jisho.org/search/雑)</span> is an exceptional one. You did learn this reading with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [雑](https://jisho.org/search/雑)巾</span>, though. Just imagine yourself with a dust cloth in your new year's dish.
* 雑, 煮
