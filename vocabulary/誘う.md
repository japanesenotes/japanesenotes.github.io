## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> invite</span>. The verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to invite</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> saw so</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さそ](https://jisho.org/search/さそ)</span>) much in this person that you decided <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to invite</span> them to dinner.
