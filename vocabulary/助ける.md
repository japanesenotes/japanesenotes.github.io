## Mnemonics:
チリチーズブリトーを食べるのを助けて欲しい人はいますか？私はそれがとても得意ですよ！
* Does anybody need any help eating their chili and cheese burrito? I’m really good at it!
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> help</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to help</span>. Don't confuse this with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [助かる](https://jisho.org/search/助かる)</span> which means to be helped. You know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [助ける](https://jisho.org/search/助ける)</span> is to help because you're doing the helping. You know that you're doing the helping because you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> care</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ける](https://jisho.org/search/ける)</span>).
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to help</span> someone. Someone is hanging off a cliff and out of reach. They ask you, the person standing above them, to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> toss</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たす](https://jisho.org/search/たす)</span>) them a rope, but you refuse. TOSS IT! they yell. I WILL NOT TOSS IT, you respond. You're a jerk.
