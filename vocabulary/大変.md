## Mnemonics:
災害時は、電話回線もネット回線も混み合って、繋がりづらくなるので、ブログの更新が大変です。
* When there's a disaster, the phone and Internet circuits are overloaded and it gets hard to connect to them, so it's difficult to upload new blog posts.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> big</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> change</span> is a really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> serious</span> thing. And people don't like change, either, making it a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> terrible</span> event. <br />Also, in more recent history this has come to mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> very</span> as well.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 大, 変
* Big, Change
* [sound:大変_b.mp3]
* [sound:大変_g.mp3]
