## Mnemonics:
この小刀はよく切れる。
* This knife cuts well.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb.<br />This is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cut</span> so this means something is cut. Something breaks or snaps. No direct object here. That's why this verb means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be cut</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span> portion: <br />Something is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> snap</span>ping. Turns out that something is your arm. Your arm is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 木</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>) that grew out of you one day. What's this ki doing here? you ask. Then it suddenly <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> break</span>s in half! OW OW OW! My ki! It's been cut!!
