## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> zero</span>, but the verb vocab version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to spill</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to drop</span>. Just imagine something that's spilling and dropping. Eventually it will reach <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> zero</span>.
* Imagine a barrel of corn <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cob</span>s, spilling and dropping out corn cobs, until they reach zero.
