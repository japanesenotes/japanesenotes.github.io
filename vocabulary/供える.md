## Mnemonics:

* 
* You don't <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> servant</span> something... but what do servants do? You are their god, so they have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to make an offering</span> to you every day.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: The offering you demand from your servants? A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sona</span>ta (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そな](https://jisho.org/search/そな)</span>), written in your honor.
* 供
* Servant
* [sound:供える_b.mp3]
* [sound:供える_g.mp3]
