## Mnemonics:
この事件を人に語ることはできない。
* I can’t talk about this case with people.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> language</span>, so when you do language you're going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to talk</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Sometimes when you're trying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to talk</span>, there will be that one person who always cuts you off <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to tell</span> everyone what they want to say. We call them language <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cutter</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かた](https://jisho.org/search/かた)</span>). They cut you off and make everyone pay attention to what they're saying. Don't be a language cutter.
