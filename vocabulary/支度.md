## Mnemonics:
いつまで寝てるの！早く起きて支度しなさい！！
* How long are you sleeping? Get up now and get ready!
* This one's a little weird. When you want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> support</span> someone in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> degrees</span> you need lots of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> preparation</span>. It takes time and planning to support someone over a period of time like that.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [度](https://jisho.org/search/度)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember them together:<br />In <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> preparation</span> for getting sheared, a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p will sit on a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tack</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [したく](https://jisho.org/search/したく)</span>). This sheep tacking makes it so that the shearing part is nothing! Imagine watching some sheep <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> getting ready</span> by sitting on tacks. Yikes. You want to tell them being sheared doesn't hurt and that sheep tacking is worse, but something makes you think they won't listen to you.
