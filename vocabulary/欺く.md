## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deceit</span>, so when you're doing deceit, you are going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to deceive</span> someone.
* As a human everyone would know who you are. You can't deceive anyone like that. But, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> as a moo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あざむ](https://jisho.org/search/あざむ)</span>)... a cow is what I mean... nobody would know who you are.
