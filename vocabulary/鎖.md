## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />The best way to break out of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chains</span> life puts on you is to put on a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cool sari</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くさり](https://jisho.org/search/くさり)</span>). A cool sari will remind you where you come from. Who your family is. And how beautiful you look. Cast off those chains and put on a cool sari!
