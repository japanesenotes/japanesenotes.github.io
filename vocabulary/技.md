## Mnemonics:
柔道では力より技のほうが大切であります。
* In judo, technique is more important than strength.
* What is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> skill</span>? It's something you can do, and do quite well. It is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> technique</span> that you can make happen with ease.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You do your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> technique</span> on a bad guy, coming at you. You flip him over and knock him out. He <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> was</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わざ](https://jisho.org/search/わざ)</span>) a threat, but now he's not. You look closer at the bad guy. Turns out it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Woz</span>, the Apple Co-founder. He was just trying to hand you an iPhone12, not grab your wrist. Whoops!
