## Mnemonics:
ねぇ、気をつけた方がいいよ。あの男がさっきあんたの飲み物に何か混ぜてたのを見たよ。
* Hey, you should watch out, I saw that guy mix something into your drink.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mix</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to mix</span>. This is when you're doing the mixing. You can remember this because <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> there</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぜる](https://jisho.org/search/ぜる)</span>) is much mixing to be done so it's best if you just do it because nobody else will.<br />The connotation for this word is you can't distinguish the things you're mixing, like combining paints, which become one mixed color that isn't two separate colors anymore.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You're doing mixing like your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ma</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ま](https://jisho.org/search/ま)</span>) taught you, which is why when you do the mixing things get done around here a lot faster.<br />You can also use the level 5 vocab <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [交ぜる](https://jisho.org/search/交ぜる)</span> to help you remember as it has the same meaning and reading!
