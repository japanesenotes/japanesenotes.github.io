## Mnemonics:

* 
* It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pleasant</span> but also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fast</span>. When getting on a train, it's nice to find a train that's both of these things. What makes it pleasant? That would be the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> high speed</span>. What makes it fast? Also the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> high speed</span>. Really, if you're on a train you'd rather get to your destination sooner than later, so a high speed <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [快速](https://jisho.org/search/快速)</span> train is the way to go.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
