* Someone who's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shock</span>ed at everything all the time will seem like an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> idiot</span>. At this point, putting your drinks in a glass shouldn't be surprising. I mean, come on. Only a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fool</span> lets himself be shocked by everything he sees.
* Remember when you learned <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [呆ける](https://jisho.org/search/呆ける)</span>? Well just cut the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span> part off the end and it's exactly the same! If you can remember that, you'll remember this reading as well.
