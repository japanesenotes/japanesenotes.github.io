## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a bit of a weird word. The kanji is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> char</span>, and a previous word you learned (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [焦げる](https://jisho.org/search/焦げる)</span>) is to be burned. This, on the other hand, is to be in a hurry or to be impatient. I guess if you're getting burned or have that feeling, you're going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be in a hurry</span> and you're going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be impatient</span>. You can tell that this is that word because it only has one kana, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span>, which stands for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ru</span>de. You're feeling someone is being rude (or maybe you are), which is why you have this feeling of impatience and hurrying.
* You're being rude, but you're also being a big <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ass</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あせ](https://jisho.org/search/あせ)</span>) with your impatience.
