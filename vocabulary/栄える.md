## Mnemonics:
中国には、覚せい剤の生産で栄えていた村がありました。
* There was a village in China flourishing from their production of stimulants.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flourish</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prosper</span>, so the verb vocab versions of these would be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to flourish</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to prosper</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: What do you flourish at? You're an amazing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soccer</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さか](https://jisho.org/search/さか)</span>) player who flourishes and prospers no matter where you go to play this wonderful (but not as good as baseball) sport.
* 栄
* Prosper
