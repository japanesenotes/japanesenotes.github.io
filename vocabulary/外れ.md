## Mnemonics:
「あたりが出ると、もう一本」とかかれたアイスをかったが、ぜんぶ外れだった。
* I bought some ice cream that had, If you hit, you get another written on them, but they were all misses.
* The kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [外](https://jisho.org/search/外)</span></span> alone means outside. This word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> extremity</span>. How can you remember this? Just think of the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れ](https://jisho.org/search/れ)</span> as a ray of sunshine. Where you are, in the extremity of space, even the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れ](https://jisho.org/search/れ)</span>s of the sun cannot be seen. So, when <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [外](https://jisho.org/search/外)</span> is combined with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れ](https://jisho.org/search/れ)</span> just think of this.
* Let's continue the previous story: You're off in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> extremity</span> of the space. You are at the edge, and you look further. All you can see is a sticky yellow <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> haze</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はず](https://jisho.org/search/はず)</span>) out in the infinite beyond.
