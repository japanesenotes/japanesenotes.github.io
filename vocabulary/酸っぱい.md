* The taste of something with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> acid</span> is... well... you'd think it'd be acidic, but it's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sour</span> taste. Some acidic things are pretty sour, though. Lemons are pretty acidic, and they're super sour too, so think about that when you need to remember this word.
