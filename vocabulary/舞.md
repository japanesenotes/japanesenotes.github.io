## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />People think you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dancing</span>, but you're really jumping from the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mice</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まい](https://jisho.org/search/まい)</span>) running on your floor. You don't want the mice running up your legs so you have to hop from one to the other, making it look like you're dancing.
* 舞
