## Mnemonics:

* 
* I want you to try to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bear</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> this</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> truth</span> and that's these kanji make up the word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clownfish</span>! Do you think a clownfish is this bear? I'm telling the truth! Maybe. 
* This word consists of the kun'yomi readings for all the kanji. You haven't learned these readings for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [之](https://jisho.org/search/之)</span> or <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [実](https://jisho.org/search/実)</span> yet though, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />If you get too close to a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clownfish</span>, it will hide inside its stinging anemone and shout, YOU DON'T <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> KNOW ME</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [のみ](https://jisho.org/search/のみ)</span>)! It's true, you don't know this clownfish, but you want to. I guess all of them are afraid of strangers though... how will you know me if you don't give me a chance, clownfish?!
