## Mnemonics:

* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [振る](https://jisho.org/search/振る)</span> is to shake. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [仮名](https://jisho.org/search/仮名)</span> is kana. This word refers to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> furigana</span>, which is the little kana that's put next to kanji for the people who don't use WaniKani and can't read anything. As to why it's called shake kana? I have no clue. Just imagine putting little kana next to kanji and watching them shake around, though, and you should be good to go.
* The readings are <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [振る](https://jisho.org/search/振る)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [仮名](https://jisho.org/search/仮名)</span> put together into one. If you know those words, you won't need no furigana to help you with this word.
* 振, 仮, 名
* Shake, Temporary, Name
