## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> supplement</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to supplement</span>.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Oh, gee, now</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おぎな](https://jisho.org/search/おぎな)</span>) you're going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to supplement</span> it? That would have been helpful earlier. Might help to say oh gee now with a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎ](https://jisho.org/search/ぎ)</span> sound instead of ji sound out loud, too. This is a tricky reading, won't be learned too easily, so think about it a bit now.
