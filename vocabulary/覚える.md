## Mnemonics:
十年前、お前が俺に殺人の容疑をかけたことは、今でも覚えているぞ。
* I still remember that you suspected me of murder ten years ago.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> memorize</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to memorize</span>. That shouldn't be too hard <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to remember</span>, right?
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use one of the kun'yomi readings. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />The best way <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to memorize</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to remember</span> something is to make up a song and play it on your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> oboe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おぼ](https://jisho.org/search/おぼ)</span>). Something about playing it makes it so you can memorize anything. You're so talented.
