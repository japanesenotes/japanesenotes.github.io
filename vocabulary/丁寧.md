* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> street</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rather</span> than a not-street. That's what I'm offering you to walk on. It's much nicer this way. I am being <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> polite</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> courteous</span> by offering you this street.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [丁](https://jisho.org/search/丁)</span> is an unexpected one. It's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てい](https://jisho.org/search/てい)</span> instead of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょう](https://jisho.org/search/ちょう)</span>, so think about how the street is lined with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ta</span>ter (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てい](https://jisho.org/search/てい)</span>) tots, and how you can eat from them as you walk along on your trek. How <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> polite</span> of someone to leave them there for you!
