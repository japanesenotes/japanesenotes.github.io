## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You make <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lacquer</span> out of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> u</span>ni <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> roo</span>t <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sh*</span>t (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うるし](https://jisho.org/search/うるし)</span>). You gotta get deep in the uni to the root of its sh*t and rub it into a paste to make the lacquer. Then rub that on wooden stuff! Yay! Uni root sh*t!
