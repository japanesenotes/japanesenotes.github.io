## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chastise</span> but the verb vocab version is to learn by experience. I guess these are kind of similar. When you make a mistake, someone will chastise you, and then you will learn by experience (either via the experience or via the chastising).
* As a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> child</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span>) you got a lot of chastising, I bet. A lot of learning by experience (of chastising).
* 懲
* Chastise
* [sound:懲りる_b.mp3]
* [sound:懲りる_g.mp3]
