## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> urge</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to urge</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Are you trying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to urge</span> me to do that? Are you trying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to coerce</span> me to do that? Which one is it? It's all <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sema</span>ntics (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せま](https://jisho.org/search/せま)</span>)!
