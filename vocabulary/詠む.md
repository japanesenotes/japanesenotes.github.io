## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> compose</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to compose</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to compose</span> a poem but all you have for inspiration is what's in your pocket. You reach in and find a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>-yo (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よ](https://jisho.org/search/よ)</span>). Ah yes, this will do. So you compose a poem about your yo-yo:<br />One string to rule them all,<br />One string to find them,<br />One string to- hey wait a minute...
