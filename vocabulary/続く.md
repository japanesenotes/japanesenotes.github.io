## Mnemonics:
金玉を捻ってしまい、痛みが五時間以上も続いています。
* I twisted my testicles and the pain has lasted for over five hours.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> continue</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to continue</span>. Please continue.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Two du</span>des (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つづ](https://jisho.org/search/つづ)</span>) get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to continue</span> on. I'm afraid you two ladies are going to have to stay here. This is a dudes only night club.
