## Mnemonics:
牛乳は悪くなっていたけど、俺は気にしなかった。
* The milk went bad, but I didn’t care.
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bad</span>? It's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bad</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Do you know how in the Mario universe all the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bad</span> versions are called <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> WARU</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わる](https://jisho.org/search/わる)</span>)? For example: WARUIJI and WARIO. That's because they are bad. They come from this kanji. So, if you ever need to remember this reading, just think back to Wario and Waruigi.
