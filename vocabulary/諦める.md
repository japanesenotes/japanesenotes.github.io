## Mnemonics:
山のようなレビューを諦めずにやるかリセットするかは、とても難しい選択です。
* Doing a mountain of reviews without giving up or resetting—it's a difficult choice.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> give up</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> abandon</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to give up</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to abandon</span>.
* Just before you're ready <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to give up</span> on something, you yell, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> AKIRA</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あきら](https://jisho.org/search/あきら)</span>)! You don't know anyone named Akira, you just saw it in a movie once and it made sense, you know? So now when you've tried really hard on something, but you have to abandon it anyway, you shout AKIRA into the sky.<br />I just did it while trying to write this mnemonic!
* 諦
* Give Up
* [sound:諦める_b.mp3]
* [sound:諦める_g.mp3]
