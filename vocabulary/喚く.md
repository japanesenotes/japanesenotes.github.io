## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scream</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to scream</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to shout</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />If you want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to shout</span> at someone you should pick a word that will really hit them. Give them a big <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> whammy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わめ](https://jisho.org/search/わめ)</span>) to the face! Hey, that word works. Shout WHAMMY!
