## Mnemonics:
俺とお前は昔は切っても切れない仲だっただろ。でもさ、 ほら、今は昔とは違うというか何というか、えっと…正直いって、お前のこと苦手なんだよ。
* You and I used to be inseparable, but you know, now it’s like… things are different. Honestly, I feel uncomfortable with you.
* A suffering hand is a little misleading. Think more in terms of the words <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [苦い](https://jisho.org/search/苦い)</span> (bitter) and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [手](https://jisho.org/search/手)</span> (person... remember how that happens sometimes?). Now think of this word like you're bitter about having to work with someone. Why? Because they are extremely <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hard to deal with</span>.
* The reading is that of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [苦い](https://jisho.org/search/苦い)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にがい](https://jisho.org/search/にがい)</span>) plus regular old <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [手](https://jisho.org/search/手)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [て](https://jisho.org/search/て)</span>). Remember, this is your bitter person, the person who's hard to deal with. So, it uses the strange <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にがい](https://jisho.org/search/にがい)</span> reading.
* 苦, 手
* Suffering, Hand
