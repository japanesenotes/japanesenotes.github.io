一日で休むことができるのは、トイレに座っている時だけだ。
* The only time that I rest each day is when I’m sitting on the toilet.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rest</span>, so what's the verb version of that? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to rest</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.
