これは俺の個人的な意見なんだけど、たまに、日本は本当に変わった国だなぁと思うんだよね。
* This is just my personal opinion, but I sometimes think that Japan is a really weird country.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> idea</span> you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> see</span> in your head is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> opinion</span>. As the dude once said... That's just, like, your <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [意見]([意](https://jisho.org/search/意)見)</span>, man.
* The reading is all on'yomi, meaning <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [意](https://jisho.org/search/意)</span> is just fine. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [見](https://jisho.org/search/見)</span>'s on'yomi (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けん](https://jisho.org/search/けん)</span>) is a reading you didn't learn with the kanji because it's so much less useful, but you do have to know it here. You've seen it with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [発見](https://jisho.org/search/発見)</span> a couple levels ago, so that should help. In this case, just think about how your opinion is that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ken</span> needs a new girlfriend. Barbie doesn't treat him right and he's always coming to the bar with new bruises... That Ken. Tell him your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> opinion</span>.
* 意, 見
