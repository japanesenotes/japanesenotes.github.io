## Mnemonics:
聖書の一番始めには何が書かれているの？
* What are the first words at the beginning of the Bible?
* You know the kanji part means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> begin</span>. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [に](https://jisho.org/search/に)</span> on the end refers to a direction. So, think of this like the direction of the beginning which would be where things all started. That's why this word/phrase means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> in the beginning</span>.
* The reading is kun'yomi (look at all that hiragana!) but that's the reading you learned with the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [始める](https://jisho.org/search/始める)</span>, so have no fear, you got it!
* 始
* Begin
* [sound:始めに_b.mp3]
* [sound:始めに_g.mp3]
