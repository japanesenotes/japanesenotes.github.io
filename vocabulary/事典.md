## Mnemonics:
本としてはちょっと大きすぎたので、私は百科事典を枕として使っていました。
* I used my encyclopedia as a pillow because it was too big to be a book.
* Something filled with the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rule</span>s of various <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> action</span>s is something that contains a ton of knowledge. It contains all things and actions, right? What kind of thing is filled with all this information (that existed during the creation of words and kanji?)? One thing would be an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> encyclopedia</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 事, 典
* Action, Rule
