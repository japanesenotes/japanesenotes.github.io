## Mnemonics:
スラリと刀をぬいたあのおとこはだれだ？
* Who’s the guy who just whipped out a sword?
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well!
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. I'm hoping you already know this word - that will make everything much easier. It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> かたな</span> (you know what a katana is, right?).
