## Mnemonics:
自分の親が常に正しいわけではないことを知るのに、時間がかかる子どももいます。
* It takes some kids a while to realize their parents aren’t always right.
* Something that goes towards <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> normal</span> is something that happens <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ordinarily</span>.
* The reading is the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn. In order to learn it, think of this: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ordinarily</span>, I <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tune</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つね](https://jisho.org/search/つね)</span>) my violin, but today I just said screw it and didn't tune it. So, now I sound like crap. Imagine this compared to how I ordinarily sound.
* 常
* Ordinary
* [sound:常に_b.mp3]
* [sound:常に_g.mp3]
