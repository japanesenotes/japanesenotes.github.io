## Mnemonics:
うちのご近所さんは、鳥を撃ち落としては、うちの池に投げ入れる。
* My neighbor keeps tossing the dead birds that he shoots into my pond.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* If you fall into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pond</span>, what sound do you make? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> EEEEK</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いけ](https://jisho.org/search/いけ)</span>)! Or maybe you're just afraid of ponds (I don't blame you, there are probably snakes or leeches or alligators in there) and you EEEEK when someone mentions them.
