## Mnemonics:

* 
* It <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hang</span>s on an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> axis</span> point. The axis opens up, and reveals a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hanging scroll</span>. This might take a little extra imagination, but I believe in you.
* For <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [掛](https://jisho.org/search/掛)</span> you'll want to think back to the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [掛](https://jisho.org/search/掛)ける</span>, then shorten it and shove it into the kanji half way (the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かけ](https://jisho.org/search/かけ)</span> part at least). For <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [軸](https://jisho.org/search/軸)</span> that's the reading you learned with the kanji, so at least you have that to work off of.
* 掛, 軸
* Hang, Axis
