## Mnemonics:
壁に寄りかかって体を支えるのがとても楽しかった。
* It was very fun for me to support myself up against the wall.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> support</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to support</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to support</span> someone. In order to support them, you grab two saws. One saw and another saw. A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> saw saw</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ささ](https://jisho.org/search/ささ)</span> combination good enough to do all the supporting you need - and maybe cut some supports too).
* 支
* Support
* [sound:支える_b.mp3]
