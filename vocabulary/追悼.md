## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Follow</span> people who <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grieve</span> by <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mourning</span> with them. You don't want to be the only one who doesn't seem sad.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [追](https://jisho.org/search/追)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mourning</span> the loss of your pet pig. You can't help but yell <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> SOOEY</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つい](https://jisho.org/search/つい)</span>) to the sky, hoping she'll come back to life. It doesn't work so you stay in a state of mourning for the rest of your life. She was your best pig friend, after all.
* 追, 悼
* Follow, Grieve
