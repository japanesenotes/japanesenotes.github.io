## Mnemonics:
手作りのプレゼントは、どれだけ暇な時間があるかってことがバレてしまうので、結構怖い。
* Handmade presents are pretty scary because they reveal that you have too much free time.
* When something is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> made</span> with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hand</span>, it is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> handmade</span>.
* The readings for these kanji are the kun'yomi readings. Just think of this word as two separate words put together (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [手](https://jisho.org/search/手)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [作る](https://jisho.org/search/作る)</span>). The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span> in <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [作る](https://jisho.org/search/作る)</span> gets changed to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [り](https://jisho.org/search/り)</span> because it's an adjective, and the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span> in <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)くり</span> gets changed to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [づ](https://jisho.org/search/づ)</span> because of the way the words are combined with each other. You should know most of the reading that is in this word, though it will probably take a little bit of thinking to sort out the little changes in those readings.
* 手, 作
* Hand, Make
