## Mnemonics:
一生の内、少なくとも一度は富士山に登ることが夢なんです。
* A dream of mine is to climb Mt. Fuji at least once in my lifetime.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> climb</span> so the verb vocab version would be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to climb</span> (or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to ascend</span>), if that's the kind of thing you're into.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. This has the same reading as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [上る](https://jisho.org/search/上る)</span> which you learned all that time ago in Level 1. If you can remember that, you can remember this one!
* 登
* Climb
* [sound:登る_b.mp3]
* [sound:登る_g.mp3]
