## Mnemonics:
テスラ・コイルをどうやって作るのかを知っていたら良かったんだけどな。
* I wish I knew how to make a Tesla coil.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> make</span>. The verb form of that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to make</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つく](https://jisho.org/search/つく)</span> portion. In order to do that let's think about something that you're going to make. Imagine something really awesome. You complete it and look at your masterpiece. It's amazing. You realize right then and there that it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> too coo</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つく](https://jisho.org/search/つく)</span>) for the general public to see. You proceed to smash it. It's way too cool.
