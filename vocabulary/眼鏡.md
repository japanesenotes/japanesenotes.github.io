## Mnemonics:

* 
* An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eyeball</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mirror</span> is something that refracts and focuses light into your eyeball in a different way so you can see better. Really, these things are glasses, not eye mirrors, but same sort of things when you get down to it. Just imagine someone wearing mirrors on their eyes, and when you ask them what those are for, they just say they're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> glasses</span>.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [眼](https://jisho.org/search/眼)</span> is the same as the vocab <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [眼](https://jisho.org/search/眼)</span>. The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [鏡](https://jisho.org/search/鏡)</span> is an exception, totally different. It shares a reading with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [金](https://jisho.org/search/金)</span> (gold), though, so think of the mirrors on the person's eyes being made of gold. What nice glasses!<br />This word can also be read as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がんきょう](https://jisho.org/search/がんきょう)</span>, but usually only on official/written documents. If you're speaking and not reading a government document, you should say <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [めがね](https://jisho.org/search/めがね)</span>!
* 眼, 鏡
* Eyeball, Mirror
