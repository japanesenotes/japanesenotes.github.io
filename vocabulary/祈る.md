## Mnemonics:
日本の国技である相撲が、かつては米の豊作を祈る儀式だったことを知ってる日本人がたくさんいるとは思えないな。
* I don’t think many Japanese people know Japan’s national sport sumo used to be a ritual to pray for a bountiful rice harvest.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pray</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to pray</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You gotta pray if you want Santa to bring you Christmas presents! <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> I know</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いの](https://jisho.org/search/いの)</span>), I know, you reply as you begin to pray to Santa. You should say this out loud to remember it better.
* 祈
* Pray
* [sound:祈る_b.mp3]
* [sound:祈る_g.mp3]
