## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spinning</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to spin</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to make yarn</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Before you start <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to spin</span> you have to let out <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two moo</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つむ](https://jisho.org/search/つむ)</span>) as tribute to the cows that gave you their fur <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to make yarn</span> out of. Go on, two moos, right now. Hey, out loud, not in your head!
