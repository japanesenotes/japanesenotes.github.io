## Mnemonics:
あなたは口が固いから教えてあげるけど、私、アヤがキンニクマの洗濯板のような腹筋と岩のように硬い胸筋を触っているのを見ちゃったんだよね。
* I'm telling this to you because you are a tight-lipped man, but I saw Aya touching Kinnikuma’s washboard stomach and rock-hard pecs.
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hard</span>? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hard</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You need to cut something that's extremely <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hard</span> so you pull out your diamond <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cutter</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かた](https://jisho.org/search/かた)</span>). Go ahead and imagine yourself cutting this ridiculously hard thing. Good thing you have diamond cutters, though.
