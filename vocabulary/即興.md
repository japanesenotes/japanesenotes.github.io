## Mnemonics:

* 
* An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> instant</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> interest</span> in something you didn't have interest in before? Well, time for some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> improvisation</span>, because you're going to have to pretend you have interest in it (since you don't actually).
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. Watch out for the shortening of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そく](https://jisho.org/search/そく)</span>.
* 即, 興
* Instant, Interest
