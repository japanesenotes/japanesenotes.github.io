## Mnemonics:

* 
* There comes a time when you need to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pull</span> yourself out of the workforce and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> retreat</span> into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> retirement</span>. At some point in everyone's lives you just can't do it anymore and you have to pull yourself out to settle down and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> retire</span>.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [引](https://jisho.org/search/引)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You can only <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> retire</span> from your life and go up to heaven if you are found <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> in</span>nocent (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いん](https://jisho.org/search/いん)</span>) of all the bad things you did on earth. Just like your job won't let you retire with good benefits if you weren't found innocent of eating your bosses cookies everyday. So if you want to have a good <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> retirement</span>, you better be innocent.
* 引, 退
