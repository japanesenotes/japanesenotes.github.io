## Mnemonics:
カピバラが食べられるのかどうか、ちょっと調べてくれない？
* Can you research capybaras and see if they are edible?
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> investigate</span> so the vocab verb version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to investigate</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You are hired <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to investigate</span> someone's wife. It is said that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> she love</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しら](https://jisho.org/search/しら)</span>) another man... but you need to investigate her to find out if that's true, for her husband of course.
