## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> present time</span>, but you can't to present time. If you try to do present time, the best you can do is try <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to show</span> it. Kind of a weird connection, but if you think through it a couple times it might get better.
* Do you remember learning <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [現れる](https://jisho.org/search/現れる)</span>? This has the same exact pronunciation!
* 現
* Present Time
* [sound:現す_b.mp3]
* [sound:現す_g.mp3]
