## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: <br />You're staring really closely at this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deer</span>, but something looks off. You get closer, slowly, and you realize it's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p in a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しか](https://jisho.org/search/しか)</span>) shaped like a deer. The sheep car deer suddenly turns toward you rushing forward, legs raised. Ahh, get outta there! (The lesson here is to never get too close to a deer. You never know its true form until it's too late.)
