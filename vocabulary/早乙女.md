## Mnemonics:

* 
* A young <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> woman</span> who is planting rice from <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> early</span> morning into the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> latter</span> evenings is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rice planting girl</span>. You'll see them out there all day long, from dawn till dusk, planting, taking care of, and picking rice.
* This is a really weird exception, sorry. You've kind of learned these reading, but they're like... weird variations of them.<br />Take the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)</span> from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [早速](https://jisho.org/search/早速)</span>, the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おつ](https://jisho.org/search/おつ)</span> becomes <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おと](https://jisho.org/search/おと)</span>, and then the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [女](https://jisho.org/search/女)</span> kun'yomi <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [め](https://jisho.org/search/め)</span> (hey that one's normal!). And you get <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)おとめ</span>. You might need to just memorize this one.
