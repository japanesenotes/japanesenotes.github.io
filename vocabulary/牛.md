## Mnemonics:
デイブは、牛にゅうのために牛をかっている。
* Dave keeps cows for milk.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. Here's a mnemonic to help you to remember it: <br />You're leading the cows around the field. To get them to move, you yell out <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> USH</span>, USH, USH! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うし](https://jisho.org/search/うし)</span>) because you have a speech impediment and want to say MUSH MUSH MUSH. Go ahead and say this out loud, yelling it if you can.
* 牛
* Cow
* [sound:牛_b.mp3]
* [sound:牛_g.mp3]
