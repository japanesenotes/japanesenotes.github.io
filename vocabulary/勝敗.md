## Mnemonics:
私の両親はいつも、全力を尽くしさえすれば、勝敗は問題ではないと言っていたけれど、私はそれが好きじゃありませんでした。もちろん、私は勝敗をとても気にします。だって、ベストを尽くした後に負けるなんて、意味が無いじゃないですか。
* My parents always told me that it doesn’t matter if I win or lose, as long as I try my best, but I didn’t like that. Of course, I care very much about winning and losing. If I lose after doing my best, then there’s no point.
* You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> win</span> and you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> failure</span>. When you are talking about both in one word, you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> victory or defeat</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
