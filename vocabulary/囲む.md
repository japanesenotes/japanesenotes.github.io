## Mnemonics:
日本は海に囲まれているんだから、塩はいつでも手に入ったんじゃないんですか？
* Since Japan is surrounded by oceans, has salt always been available there?
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> surround</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to surround</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You have been surrounded. They circle around you, calling you a chicken. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Cacko</span>! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かこ](https://jisho.org/search/かこ)</span>) Cacko! Cacko! Wait, this isn't the sound a chicken makes, right? You laugh at them, thinking their way of making a chicken noise is weird. Go ahead and join in with them and say Cacko with them as well.
