## Mnemonics:
私はとても太いので、私が道を歩いる時にペニーを踏んだら、女王様の鼻から鼻くそが飛び出ます。
* I’m so fat that when I walk down the street and step on a penny, I squeeze a booger out of the Queen’s nose.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> walk</span> so the verb version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to walk</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ある](https://jisho.org/search/ある)</span> portion. Imagine yourself going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to walk</span> outside. But, as you walk, you walk like a pirate. You have a peg leg, a parrot, and a hook. Lastly, you say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> arrrrr</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ある](https://jisho.org/search/ある)</span>). Go ahead, say it out loud while walking around your room like a pirate. It will help.
