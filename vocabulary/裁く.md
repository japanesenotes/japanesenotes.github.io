## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> judge</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to judge</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: When you go <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to judge</span> people, there are different types. The one you truly hate the most, however, is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sobber</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さば](https://jisho.org/search/さば)</span>). The Sobber is the worst kind. They just sob and sob and sob and it's really hard to move on to your next judging.
