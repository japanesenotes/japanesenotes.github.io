## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> look up to</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to look up at</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to look up to</span>.
* Personally, I look up to the color <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 青</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あお](https://jisho.org/search/あお)</span>). Literally and figuratively. I love the color blue, so I look up to it and respect it. Also, I look up at the sky and it's blue.
* 仰
* Look Up To
