## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is ateji, meaning the meanings of the kanji don't mean anything, only the sounds are being borrowed to make the word in Japanese. So, skip to the reading and use that to remember the meaning. It's an English word too now, after all.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
* 寿, 司
* Lifespan, Director
* [sound:寿司_b.mp3]
