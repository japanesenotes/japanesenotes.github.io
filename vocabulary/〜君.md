## Mnemonics:
日本の男の子の名前の後ろには「君」という言葉が付けられるそうだが、ラという名前の男の子があまりいないというのは残念ですね。
* Kun is used as a suffix for boys’ names in Japan. It’s too bad there aren’t a lot of kids with the name Ra.
* Add this to the end of someone's name, it's like saying ______<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> buddy</span>. It's generally used as a name ender (like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さん](https://jisho.org/search/さん)</span>) for boys and young men. Don't use this on people who are higher ranked than you (socially or literally). As in, you wouldn't use it on your boss. Use it on your younger male subordinates as well as boys who aren't adults yet.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji (on'yomi), probably because it usually is attached to other words (aka names, like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち君](https://jisho.org/search/こういち君)</span>) making it act more like jukugo words do.
* 君
* Buddy
* [sound:〜君_b.mp3]
* [sound:〜君_g.mp3]
