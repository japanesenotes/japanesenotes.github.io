## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yearn for</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to yearn for</span>. But that sounds kinda old fashioned, so you can just use <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to adore</span> too.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You realize you're starting <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to yearn for</span> someone way more than you used to. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Sh*t</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [した](https://jisho.org/search/した)</span>)...  you say to yourself. This wasn't supposed to happen. Anytime you start to adore someone like that you always know you're getting into a bunch of sh*t you don't want to deal with. Damn these emotions!
