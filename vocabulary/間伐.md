## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Fell</span> trees in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> interval</span>s, instead of all at once, and it's called <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tree thinning</span>. That way there's still some forest there, but you get your wood to use for other things too. 
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
