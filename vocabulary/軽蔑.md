## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Lightweight</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scorn</span>, no matter how light, is still <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scorn</span>. Those feelings are pretty strong no matter what.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [軽](https://jisho.org/search/軽)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You have more <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scorn</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> disdain</span> for the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> K</span>KK (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けい](https://jisho.org/search/けい)</span>) than any other group in the whole world. And I'm not going to argue with you, they're pretty hatable.
