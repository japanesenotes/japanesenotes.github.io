## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> supply</span> of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bean</span>s is when you take a bunch of beans, mash them up into a supply, and then ferment them all together to make them into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> natto</span> (also known as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fermented soybeans</span>).
* The reading is an exceptional one. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [豆](https://jisho.org/search/豆)</span> is okay, and is the on'yomi reading from the kanji. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [納](https://jisho.org/search/納)</span> part is weird though. Instead of being <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [のう](https://jisho.org/search/のう)</span> it's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なっ](https://jisho.org/search/なっ)</span>. But, if you can remember the meaning of this word, you can just think about how you do <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> not</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なっ](https://jisho.org/search/なっ)とう</span>) want to eat <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> natto</span>. At least a lot of people don't want to eat it. It's quite the acquired taste.
