## Mnemonics:
恋愛での別れ際は、切なくて甘酸っぱい。
* Parting from someone you love is always painfully bittersweet.
* When you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> romance</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> love</span> all in the same package. Well, that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> love</span>! Ah, love! This is the word used when talking about love, though. You don't use this to say I love you.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 恋, 愛
