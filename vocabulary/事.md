## Mnemonics:
すまないが、ちょっと今はする事がたくさんあって、忙しいんだ。
* I’m sorry but I’ve been busy recently because I have a lot of things to do.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Additionally on top of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thing</span> there are the meanings <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> matter</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> action</span> as well. Like the kanji, this word has to do with action things... things that you do, for example, rather than physical things.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />It's hard to start a mnemonic with the word thing or action, so let's continue off the kanji mnemonic where you're brushing your teeth with a cross shaped thing. After you're done, it's time to go out. You put on your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coat</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こと](https://jisho.org/search/こと)</span>) and walk out the door.
* 事
* Action
