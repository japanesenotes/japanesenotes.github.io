## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> annoy</span>? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> annoying</span>!
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />What's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> noisy</span>? That <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> u</span>ni's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ru</span>de <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sigh</span>ing (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うるさい](https://jisho.org/search/うるさい)</span>). It just keeps sighing loudly over and over. It's sooo annoying!
