## Mnemonics:

* 
* You remember how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [載る](https://jisho.org/search/載る)</span> is to be published? This one is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to publish</span>, as in you do it yourself. You know this because you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sel</span>f (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せる](https://jisho.org/search/せる)</span>) publish, which makes it so you're able to publish something (no publishers would accept that rubbish about the vampires, sorry).
* The reading is shared with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [載る](https://jisho.org/search/載る)</span>, so as long as you remember that you can remember this.
* 載
