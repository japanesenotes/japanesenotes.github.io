## Mnemonics:
思うだけならまだ違法じゃないよ。
* The simple act of thinking is not illegal, yet.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> think</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to think</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おも](https://jisho.org/search/おも)</span> part to read this word. To do this, though, you'll have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to think</span> about that guy... hmm... what was his name? He's on The Simpsons... he's the bartender? I think? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Oh! Moe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おも](https://jisho.org/search/おも)</span>) is his name! Thank you. Now I remember.<br />If you don't know Moe from the Simpsons use a different Moe, perhaps the one from the Three Stooges? You should be able to come up with one.
