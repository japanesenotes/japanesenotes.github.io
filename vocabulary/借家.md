家を買う代わりに借家を借りる提案をサーモンに切り出そうとしてるんだけど、彼女、その話題には触れないようにしてるみたいなんだよね。
* I’m trying to talk to Salmon about renting a house instead of buying one, but she kind of keeps skirting the issue.
* When you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> borrow</span> a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> house</span> you are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> renting a house</span>. Also, this is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> house for rent</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji, but in this case the second kanji can be read as either the on'yomi or kun'yomi. You haven't seen the kun'yomi for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [家](https://jisho.org/search/家)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />If you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> renting a house</span>, someone has to give you the keys and let you in and stuff. You're only renting, after all. So when they let you in they'll say, Here's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shack</span> for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yah</span>! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゃくや]([しゃく](https://jisho.org/search/しゃく)や)</span>) Enjoy!<br />By the way, in the secondary reading, the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゃく](https://jisho.org/search/しゃく)</span> goes to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゃっ](https://jisho.org/search/しゃっ)</span>. You'll see <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゃくや]([しゃく](https://jisho.org/search/しゃく)や)</span> more often, though.
