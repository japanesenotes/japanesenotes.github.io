## Mnemonics:
郵便物をこちら住所の方へ転送して頂きたいんですが。
* Could you please forward my mail to this address?
* So, you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> send</span>ing something that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> revolve</span>s. It's a little <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> transfer</span> / <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> transmission</span>, going through the wires. Little messages that revolve around as they zip through the lines to get to their destination. Try to imagine this happening in slow motion, getting to the other end.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 転, 送
* Revolve, Send
