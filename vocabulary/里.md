* I’m traveling to my hometown and I’m hoping I don’t run into anyone I know.
* This is the village you came from. This is where your parents live. This is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> home village</span> (same meaning as the kanji you learned).
* The reading is the same as with the kanji you learned. It's like the village vocab word goes home to its kanji every once in a while. They share the same reading origin because of this.
