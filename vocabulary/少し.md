## Mnemonics:
かれのプロポーズは少しあいまいだった。
* His proposal was a little vague.
* This word is a single kanji with hiragana attached, though there is no specific clue as to what type of word it is. That means you can usually guess it's a noun, adverb or na-adjective (in this case it's a noun / adverb). The meaning of this word is pretty much the same as the kanji, though, making it fairly easy. The kanji meaning for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [少](https://jisho.org/search/少)</span></span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> few</span>, and the meaning of the vocab form is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a little</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a few</span>.
* Did you know that this word created an English word you probably already know? Have you ever heard someone say just a skosh? That's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [少](https://jisho.org/search/少)し</span></span>! Hopefully you know this English word and therefore know this Japanese word as well.
