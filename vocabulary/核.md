* The nuclear missile launch is three hours behind schedule now.
* The kanji and the word are the same. That means they share meanings as well. This word can also mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> core</span> because that's where the nucleus is in a cell, and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nuclear</span> because we like to blow ourselves up nowadays...
