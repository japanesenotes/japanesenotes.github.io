## Mnemonics:

* 
* You've seen that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [召す](https://jisho.org/search/召す)</span> can mean to respectfully eat, so adding <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [上がる](https://jisho.org/search/上がる)</span>, to rise, means you're lifting the other person up. In polite language you use this when you're talking to someone higher up than you so you have to raise the humbly eating up. So it still means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to respectfully eat</span>, but raising it makes it a higher politeness level.
* This is a combination of the words <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [召す](https://jisho.org/search/召す)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [上がる](https://jisho.org/search/上がる)</span> that you learned already. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [召す](https://jisho.org/search/召す)</span> becomes <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [召し](https://jisho.org/search/召し)</span> and then you add that to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [上がる](https://jisho.org/search/上がる)</span>. Pretty straightforward, right?
* 召, 上
* Call, Above
