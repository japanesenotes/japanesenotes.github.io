## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You look at the floor. It's disgusting. Dirtiest and nastiest floor you've ever seen. You say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yucka</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆか](https://jisho.org/search/ゆか)</span>) because it's covered in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yucca</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆか](https://jisho.org/search/ゆか)</span>). Plus, it's all rotten.
