* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> distract</span> and the verb vocab version of this word is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to distract</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to divert</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.
