## Mnemonics:
この新聞すっげー専門用語だらけじゃん。スコットがこの新聞を何回も読まなきゃいけないのは当然だな。
* This newspaper is so highbrow. No wonder Scott had to read it so many times.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> new</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hear</span> is what it sounds like. It's new things that you're hearing about in your ear... at least that's what it was back a long time ago. Now those new things that get to your ear get to you via other mediums. In this case, a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> newspaper</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 新, 聞
* New, Hear
