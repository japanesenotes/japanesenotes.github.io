## Mnemonics:
この仔犬は里心がついて泣いているのかもしれないけど、そんなのかまうもんか。
* This puppy may be crying because he is homesick, but who cares?
* You have your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> home village</span> and your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> heart</span>. Your heart always resides in your home village, so when you leave you feel <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> homesick</span>.<br />Young people don't really use this word anymore. It's more for the oldies. If you're an oldie, go right ahead. If you're a youngie, then talk to more oldies!
* The readings are double kun'yomi. The kun'yomi reading is what you learned with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [里](https://jisho.org/search/里)</span> already, though you'll have to pull out the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [心](https://jisho.org/search/心)</span> vocab reading to remember it all. Not only that, the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [心](https://jisho.org/search/心)</span> gets rendaku'd here making it <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ごころ](https://jisho.org/search/ごころ)</span>. Make sure you watch out for that.
* 里, 心
* Home Village, Heart
