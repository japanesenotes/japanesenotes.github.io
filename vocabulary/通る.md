## Mnemonics:
お茶会のためのメープルシロップを買うために、カナダを通ってイギリスに行った。
* I stopped by Canada on the way to England to get some maple syrup for the tea party.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pass through</span> so the verb vocab version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to pass through</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />There's something in front of you that you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to pass through</span> but you can't. It's a wall. In order to pass through it, you decide to kick it as hard as you can to knock it down. Unfortunately, it is way stronger than you, and your toe explodes on contact. You yell: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> TOE! OH!</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とお](https://jisho.org/search/とお)</span>) and then just scream a lot.
* 通
