## Mnemonics:
私はベッドの上にある見えないプールで泳いで運動しているんです。
* I exercise by swimming in an invisible pool on my bed.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> swim</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to swim</span>.
* The reading is kun'yomi (see that hiragana sticking out?) but that's the reading you learned with the kanji.
* 泳
* Swim
* [sound:泳ぐ_b.mp3]
* [sound:泳ぐ_g.mp3]
