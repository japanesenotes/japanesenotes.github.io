## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This can refer to all kinds of things, like a spider's nest or a mouse's burrow or a bee's hive, etc. Basically, it's a place where animals live, not necessarily just a nest as in a bird's nest, etc.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
* 巣
* Nest
* [sound:巣_b.mp3]
