こんなに不味い味噌汁を飲んだことはありません。
* I’ve never eaten such disgusting miso soup.
* You've seen <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [美味しい]([美](https://jisho.org/search/美)味しい)</span> by this point. This is the opposite of that. Instead of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [美](https://jisho.org/search/美)</span> you have <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [不](https://jisho.org/search/不)</span> (not), so something that does <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> not</span> have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flavor</span> is something that doesn't taste good. i.e. something <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bad tasting</span>. This can also refer to someone who's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> unskillful</span> at something as well.
* The reading doesn't follow any of the rules you've run into. It's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まずい]([まず](https://jisho.org/search/まず)い)</span>. Think about how you're going through this really long <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> maze</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まず](https://jisho.org/search/まず)</span>) and how you're promised a really tasty wonderful treat at the end for getting through it (you're a lab rat or something). When you get to the end, there's your treat! What joy! You eat it and... oh man... it is so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bad tasting</span> you can't even believe it. Be sure to imagine the terrible taste and the terrible disappointment after going through that difficult maze only to get this... this... terribly <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> unappetizing</span> cheese.
* 不, 味
* Not, Flavor
