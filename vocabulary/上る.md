## Mnemonics:
サケが川を上っているのをみた。
* I saw a salmon swimming upstream.
* This vocab word is an exception in almost every way. It has a similar meaning to the meaning of the kanji, and you know it's a verb because it ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span>, in this case). But, the meaning is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to climb</span>. Comparing it to the other <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [上](https://jisho.org/search/上)</span> verb words, it has the least okurigana (versus <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [上](https://jisho.org/search/上)げる</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [上](https://jisho.org/search/上)がる</span>). You could remember this and know that the thing you don't want to do the most is to climb, so that's why it has the least okurigana.
* The reading for this word is an exception from all the rules of the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [上](https://jisho.org/search/上)</span> vocabulary. It consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, so it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to climb</span> the mountain, but a gruff old man grabs your shoulder and says <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> No bo</span>y, you ain't climbing that thing, not today. If you're not a boy, think about how weird it is that he called you a boy. If you are a grown man, think how you wish he called you dude or something, not boy. If you're a boy, well... think about how appropriate it is that he said no boy.
* 上
* Above
* [sound:上る_b.mp3]
* [sound:上る_g.mp3]
