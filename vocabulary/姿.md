## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: What's that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> figure</span> / <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shape</span> in the distance? Is that who I think it is? Is that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Sugar To</span>m (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すがた](https://jisho.org/search/すがた)</span>)??? You'll have to make up some lore about this Sugar Tom but whatever you do be excited about him. He's a dude who gives you tons of sugar, I'm guessing, and you always see him coming from a long ways away because of his Sugar Tom hat, or something like that.
