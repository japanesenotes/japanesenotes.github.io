## Mnemonics:
もう絶対にメキシコの軽トラの積み荷から魚を買うもんか。
* I’ll never buy fish from the back of a pickup truck in Mexico again.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />Imagine a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fish</span>. Now imagine the fish playing soccer, while wearing a nun's outfit. This is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soccer nu</span>n (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さかな](https://jisho.org/search/さかな)</span>).
* 魚

* [sound:魚_b.mp3]
