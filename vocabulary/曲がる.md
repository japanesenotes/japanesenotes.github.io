## Mnemonics:
野球のボールが当たってから、僕の小指はちょっとだけ左に曲がっています。
* Since getting hit with a baseball my pinky finger bends slightly to the left.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means both <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> music</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bend</span>. In the case of this word, we're looking at bend. So, the verb form of bend is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be bent</span>. This is when something bends on its own, not when you're doing the bending. It's just bending.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Something, let's say a road, starts out straight. But, with some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ma</span>gic, a witch causes it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to curve</span>.
* 曲
* Music
* [sound:曲がる_b.mp3]
