## Mnemonics:

* 
* Look in the sea and you'll see what looks like a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crow</span> moving under the water and it's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thief</span>! It's stealing from all the fish. As it comes closer you see that it isn't a crow, it's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> squid</span>. Or a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cuttlefish</span>? One or the other.
* The reading for this word is an exception. I'd give you a mnemonic to remember it but it looks like the mnemonic for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いか](https://jisho.org/search/いか)</span> is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いか](https://jisho.org/search/いか)</span>! If you've been paying attention, you know this is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> squid</span> already!
