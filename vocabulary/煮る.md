## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boil</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to boil</span>.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
* 煮
* Boil
