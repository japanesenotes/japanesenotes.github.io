## Mnemonics:
コウイチとビエトは、年に一度トーフグオフィスで開かれる剣道の大会で、優れた腕前を披露しようと競い合いました。
* Koichi and Viet competed with each other to demonstrate their prowess at the annual Kendo competition held in the Tofugu office.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> compete</span> so the verb vocab version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to compete</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to compete</span> for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kiss</span>es (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きそ](https://jisho.org/search/きそ)</span>) from that boy/girl you like. Imagine yourself doing this, competing with a rival.
