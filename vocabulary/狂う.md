## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lunatic</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crazy</span>. The verb version of this is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to go mad</span> (you don't really go lunatic now, do you?) or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to go crazy</span>.
* To remember the reading, just think about how when you go crazy, you are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coming</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [来る](https://jisho.org/search/来る)</span>) to crazy town. Just imagine some voice beckoning you to come. Come here! Please come here! Come to crazy town! Give in to the voices!
