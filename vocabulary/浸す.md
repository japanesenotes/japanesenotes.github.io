## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> immersed</span>, so the verb version is what happens when you immerse something in a liquid. It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to soak</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to dip</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You already learned this reading when you learned <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [浸る](https://jisho.org/search/浸る)</span>, so you should know this one too.
