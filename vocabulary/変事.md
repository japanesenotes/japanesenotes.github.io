## Mnemonics:
私は変事の前の不気味な静けさにいつもワクワクする。
* I always get excited during that ominous silence that happens before an unusual incident.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> strange</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> action</span> that takes place is something that shouldn't have happened (but it did). This is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> strange incident</span>. The difference between this and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [事変](https://jisho.org/search/事変)</span> is that while <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [事変](https://jisho.org/search/事変)</span> can also be used to describe a strange incident, it also can be used to talk about another type of incident as well. For example, the Manshuu Jihen is the Manshuu Incident. This word, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [変事](https://jisho.org/search/変事)</span> is more just a strange or unusual incident.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 変, 事
* Change, Action
* [sound:変事_b.mp3]
* [sound:変事_g.mp3]
