うわ！君のお兄さんって、君の二倍の体重があるんだね！
* Wow! Your brother weighs twice as much as you, huh?
* Something that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> times</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> double</span> (or it is just simply <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two times</span>). Of course, this all works with things like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [三倍](https://jisho.org/search/三倍)</span>, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [百倍](https://jisho.org/search/百倍)</span>, and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [四十二倍](https://jisho.org/search/四十二倍)</span> as well.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 二, 倍
* Two, Double
