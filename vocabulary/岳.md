## Mnemonics:

* 
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> peak</span> of the mountain is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> peak</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mountain</span>.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />When you climb to the top of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> peak</span>, you're so amazed to find vegetation at this altitude. The only thing that grows here, and in thick amounts, is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 竹</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たけ](https://jisho.org/search/たけ)</span>). It is impeding your progress to the very top of the peak, in fact, which is a bother. It's as if it's guarding something...
