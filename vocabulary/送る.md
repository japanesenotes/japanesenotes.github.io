## Mnemonics:
遅くなったね。今日はここまでにしよう。家まで送るよ。
* It’s getting late. Let’s call it a day. I’ll walk you home.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> send</span> so the vocab verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to send</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You need to send an entire <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> oak</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おく](https://jisho.org/search/おく)</span>) tree in the mail, but it's too big. Imagine yourself dragging one to the post office. They tell you that you can't send that here... Go to the oak sending facilities.
