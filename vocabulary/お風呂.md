## Mnemonics:

* 
* Let the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wind</span> in from the window above your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bath</span> so the water is cool enough for you to take a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bath</span>! If the water is too hot, you'll get all dizzy and that's dangerous!
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. This isn't the same on'yomi reading you learned for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [風](https://jisho.org/search/風)</span>, though. It's a little different: <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>. If you're taking a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bath</span> you'd be a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foo</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>) to bring food in there. Drop the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> or you'll end up as soup!
* 風, 呂
