## Mnemonics:
残りの人生をどう過ごすか、みんなは一体どうやって決めるんだい？選びきれないほど仕事があるじゃないか。
* How do people decide what they’re going to do for the rest of their lives? There are so many jobs to choose from.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> decide</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to decide</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to decide</span>. You have two <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>) in front of you. You have to decide on one of them and use it to unlock the door to get away from the monster. Why do monster attacks always come down to keys and doors?
* 決
* Decide
* [sound:決める_b.mp3]
* [sound:決める_g.mp3]
