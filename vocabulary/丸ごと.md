## Mnemonics:
このケーキには林檎が丸ごと入っています。
* This cake is filled entirely with apples.
* If you go to (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ごと](https://jisho.org/search/ごと)</span>) a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> circle</span>, you need to go to it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> in its entirety</span>. That means you have to circle around the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> whole</span> thing. Otherwise, it isn't even a circle. It's like a line or a squiggle or something.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading, so you should be able to read this too!
