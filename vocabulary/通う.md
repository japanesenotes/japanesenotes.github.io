## Mnemonics:
私の妹は、四月からトーフグ学園に通うことになります。
* My younger sister will attend Tofugu Academy starting in April.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pass through</span> but we already know the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [通る](https://jisho.org/search/通る)</span> which means to pass through. This word means a different kind of passing through, like how you pass through the halls of your school everyday. But we don't say to pass through school, we say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to attend</span> school, or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to commute</span> to school.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use one of the kun'yomi readings. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You live in the middle of three different school districts so you need to decide which of the three schools you want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to attend</span>. You decide you don't mind that you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to commute</span> to the farthest of the three because their mascot is Wile E. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Coyo</span>te (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かよ](https://jisho.org/search/かよ)</span>). He's your favorite Looney Toon because he always has the energy <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to go back and forth</span> after that road runner.
