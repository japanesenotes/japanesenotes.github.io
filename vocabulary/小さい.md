## Mnemonics:
ぼくのりそうのマリモは、小さい玉ねぎのようなマリモだ。
* My ideal marimo would look like a small onion.
* This kanji has hiragana attached and ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> sound. That means it's probably an adjective (and it is!). So, if you take the kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [小](https://jisho.org/search/小)</span> and its meaning (small), you can figure out the adjective version of it. What is the adjective version of small? Actually, it's the same thing: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> small</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちい](https://jisho.org/search/ちい)</span> portion: <br />When you think of the word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> small</span>, try to think of this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chee</span>se (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちい](https://jisho.org/search/ちい)</span>) store. You go inside, and all of their cheeses are so small. They hand you a magnifying glass to see all the cheeses. You look at them and exclaim: Why are these cheeses so small???
