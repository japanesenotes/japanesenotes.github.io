* You're only <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nearby</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> while</span> you are nearby, that's it.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.  You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br /><span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> While</span> you live as a normal human citizen you also have another life as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cutter wa</span>lrus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かたわ](https://jisho.org/search/かたわ)</span>)! That's a walrus that cuts fish up while eating. It's your secret double life. You do it at night while you are a human by day!
