## Mnemonics:
内にひめたおもいを、日きにつづった。
* The thoughts I hide inside myself were spelled out in my diary.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:<br />There's something inside and you wanna get to what's within. Look inside. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ooh, chee</span>se (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うち](https://jisho.org/search/うち)</span>)! Your favorite. Ooh cheese, how I love you.
* 内
