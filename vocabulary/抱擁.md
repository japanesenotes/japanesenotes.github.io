## Mnemonics:

* 
* An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> embrace</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hug</span> are pretty much the same thing. So you're still going to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> embrace</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hug</span> people!
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [抱](https://jisho.org/search/抱)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />Who gives the best <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hug</span>s in the world? Harry <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Hou</span>dini (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほう](https://jisho.org/search/ほう)</span>)! He knows what it's like to be hugged too tightly because he's always in straight jackets. So his hugs are nice and gentle. Just the way you like them!
* 抱, 擁
* Hug, Embrace
* [sound:抱擁_b.mp3]
