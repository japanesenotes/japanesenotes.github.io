* My older brother has a huge pet spider in his Japanese-style room.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Japanese style</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> room</span> tends to be pretty small. This mainly refers to the kind of room that's covered in tatami mats, though. If you're looking for places to stay in Japan, a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [和室](https://jisho.org/search/和室)</span> will be something like that. You'll pull the futon out of the closet and sleep on the floor. So comfy, these <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Japanese style room</span>s!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 和, 室
* Peace, Room
