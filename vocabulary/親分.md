## Mnemonics:
親分にバレたら大目玉を食らうぞ。
* The chief will chew us out if we let it slip.
* Who is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> part</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> parent</span> to you? Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boss</span>! They make it so you can take care of yourself by paying you, don't they? They'll break the legs of someone who crosses you. But they won't help you get back to sleep after you have nightmares. So they're only part like a parent.
* This word consists of the kun'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [親](https://jisho.org/search/親)</span> and the on'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [分](https://jisho.org/search/分)</span>. You've learned both of these so you should be able to read this already!
* 親, 分
* Parent, Part
* [sound:親分_b.mp3]
* [sound:親分_g.mp3]
