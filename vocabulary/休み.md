## Mnemonics:
明日は休みなので、一日中一人でマリオカートをする予定です。
* Tomorrow is my day off, so I’m planning to play Mario Kart by myself for the entire day.
* The kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rest</span> has a little hiragana attached, but it's nothing that would suggest it's anything but a noun (it is!). It means the same thing as the kanji, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rest</span>.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji with some hiragana, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />So, do you want a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rest</span> from work or school? You should say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Yes!</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [やす](https://jisho.org/search/やす)</span>).
* 休
* Rest
* [sound:休み_b.mp3]
* [sound:休み_g.mp3]
