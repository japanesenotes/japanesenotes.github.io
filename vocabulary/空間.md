## Mnemonics:
宇宙空間には空気がないけど、それでもやっぱり月に住みたい。
* Even though there is no air in space, I still want to live on the moon.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sky</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> interval</span> is an area of the sky. In places that are just empty sky, there is only <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> space</span>. Of course, not technically... there's something there, but back in the day when kanji was being made, nobody knew that. This word can mean both space in regards to outer space as well as the space around you in your room.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 空, 間
* Sky, Interval
* [sound:空間_b.mp3]
