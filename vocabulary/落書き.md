## Mnemonics:
スプレーでの落書きアートは既に少し時代遅れです。新しい芸術家達は、壁の汚れをゴシゴシ擦って洗い落としながらアートを創りだします。
* Spray-painting graffiti is already a bit old-fashioned. The newer artists create works of art by scrubbing the dirt off the wall.
* When <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> writing</span> just happens to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fall</span> on the wall (whoops, wasn't me who did that, how strannnnge) it's writing that's not supposed to be where it is. This kind of writing is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> graffiti</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [書](https://jisho.org/search/書)</span>, however, is kun'yomi in this case and also has rendaku. So just remember that it's read as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [が](https://jisho.org/search/が)</span> for this vocab and you'll be fine.
* 落, 書
* Fall, Write
