## Mnemonics:
私の名字はあなたには絶対教えません。
* I will never tell you my family name.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> name</span> written in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> letter</span>s is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> surname</span>. Back in the day your surname was the important name (it's your family name after all, and family was king back in the day). This is the name you'd write out in kanji... aka in letters. So, that's why this combination of kanji means surname.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. <br />Note that the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [名](https://jisho.org/search/名)</span> portion is the alternate reading, so adjust your thinking accordingly so you can get to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みょう](https://jisho.org/search/みょう)</span>. Just imagine someone saying more with a funny accent. They say myou instead of more. Imagine them saying they have myou people in their family than yours. Their surname is spread amongst myou people than yours.
