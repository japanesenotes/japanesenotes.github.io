## Mnemonics:
あの男はみんなに調子のいいことばかり言うから嫌いよ。
* I hate that guy because he only says things that flatter the listener.
* Imagine yourself <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> investigating</span> a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> child</span>. You heard this child was having a rough time, so you need to come check on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> condition</span> of his home and life. You find the condition to be terrible, and you tell the parents you have to take the child away because of these conditions (imagine them being ridiculously bad... perhaps they raise raccoons in their kitchen?).
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 調, 子
* Investigate, Child
* [sound:調子_b.mp3]
