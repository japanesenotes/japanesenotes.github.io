## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> he</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> woman</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> she</span>. Also could mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> girlfriend</span>, depending on how it's used.
* The reading for this is a bit weird, at least for the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [彼](https://jisho.org/search/彼)</span> portion. Just think about how <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> she</span> (your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> girlfriend</span>) is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> canoe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かの](https://jisho.org/search/かの)</span>), and you love that canoe girlfriend more than anything. She is your best friend and your lover, and everyone thinks you're weird. Imagine everyone thinking you're weird as you give kisses to your canoe girlfriend.
* 彼, 女
* He, Woman
