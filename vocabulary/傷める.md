## Mnemonics:

* 
* If you go to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wound</span> something, you are going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to damage</span> it. Ouch!
* When you damage something, though, how does it feel? Does it hurt, like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [痛い](https://jisho.org/search/痛い)</span>? Wait, what's the reading of this? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> いためる</span>, just like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [痛い](https://jisho.org/search/痛い)</span>'s reading. That should be easy to remember, unless I accidentally damage your brain with these mnemonics or something.
* 傷
* Wound
