## Mnemonics:
Tofuguよ安らかに眠ってくれ。今月初めに、僕の一番好きな日本語学習サイトが倒産しちゃったんだ。
* R.I.P. Tofugu. At the beginning of this month my favorite Japanese learning site went bankrupt.
* This is a time based word (because of the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [に](https://jisho.org/search/に)</span>). What is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> first</span> point of time when you are beginning something? That is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beginning</span>.
* This word uses the kun'yomi, which you didn't learn with the kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you out. What are you beginning? You are beginning <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Haj</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はじ](https://jisho.org/search/はじ)</span>). (Haj is the fifth pillar of Islam, and is a pilgrimage to Mecca during the month of Dhu al-Hijja).
* 初
* First
* [sound:初めに_b.mp3]
