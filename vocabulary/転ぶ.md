## Mnemonics:
コウイチはもう少しで地面に転ぶところだったが、スーパーマンのコスプレをしたビエトに助けられた。
* Koichi had almost fallen to the ground, but Viet, who was wearing a Superman costume, saved him.
* Do you remember the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [転がる](https://jisho.org/search/転がる)</span>? This is kind of similar, instead of rolling, this is more for when something falls and hits the ground. It means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to fall over</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to fall down</span>. Just imagine someone falling off a chair face first into the dirt and making a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶ](https://jisho.org/search/ぶ)</span> sound.
* The reading comes from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [転がる](https://jisho.org/search/転がる)</span>. Hopefully you know that one well enough to associate it with this one, meaning you can read them both.
* 転
* Revolve
* [sound:転ぶ_b.mp3]
* [sound:転ぶ_g.mp3]
