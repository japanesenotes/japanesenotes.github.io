## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Milord</span> (you say very formally with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> formal name title</span>). You say it very formally because this person is a lord, or more specifically, a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> feudal lord</span>.
* This word uses the kun'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [殿](https://jisho.org/search/殿)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br /><span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Feudal Lord</span>s were pretty brutal back in the day. If you did something wrong he'd get to punish you. What kind of punishment? Well, he'd cut off your toe! That left most people yelling, My <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> toe?! NO</span>! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [との](https://jisho.org/search/との)</span>). Imagine screaming Toe no! over and over as the feudal lord got closer and closer. Holding a pair of hedge clippers or something. Maybe if you yell toe no enough times, he'll change his mind.
