## Mnemonics:
わたしの子、ビヨンセににているとおもわない？
* Don’t you think my kid looks similar to Beyoncé?
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:<br />You see a child and walk up to him. Then, you punch him in the face (oh no, how could you!!?). He flies through the air, and he's knocked out. A ref nearby yells that it was a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> KO</span>! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span>). That's a knock out.<br />Make sure you learn this reading pretty well too. Both readings for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span> are going to show up a lot, and this is how you're going to learn the kun'yomi one.
