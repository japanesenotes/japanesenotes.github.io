## Mnemonics:
あなた達はまだ未成年でしょう。
* Aren’t you still minors?
* You'll see this attached to other words to make them <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> plural</span>. That's why it's called a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pluralizing suffix</span>. 
* This is almost the same reading you learned with the kanji. Remember <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たつ](https://jisho.org/search/たつ)</span>? Well this is read <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たち](https://jisho.org/search/たち)</span>. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember it:<br />If you want to pluralize something, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> touch</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たち](https://jisho.org/search/たち)</span>) it to something else. One egg touches another egg, well now they're eggs. Plural eggs! One friend? No. Touch them! Touch them right on the face. Now there are two friends. Plural friends! Thanks to the good ol' pluralizing suffix touch!<br />Oh, and don't type the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [〜](https://jisho.org/search/〜)</span> out when writing the answer. It's just there to let you know that there's usually something attached to this word.
