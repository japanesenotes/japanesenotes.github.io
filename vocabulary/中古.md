## Mnemonics:
中古のかぐのような人とはけっこんしたくない。
* I don’t want to get married to someone who is like a piece of used furniture.
* The combination of kanji doesn't make perfect sense, but it's alright. Take something that's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> middle</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> old</span> and you have something that's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> used</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> secondhand</span>. It's not 100% old yet... it's still in the middle, meaning you can give it to someone else to use, like your younger siblings.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 中, 古
* Middle, Old
* [sound:中古_b.mp3]
