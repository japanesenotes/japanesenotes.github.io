## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> swell</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to swell</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to expand</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />If someone comes up to you and says, Hey it looks like you've really started to expand around the middle. Go ahead and say a big old, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> F@#$</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふく](https://jisho.org/search/ふく)</span>) you! If someone is rude to you, dish it right back out. F@#$ that guy!
