## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [陰](https://jisho.org/search/陰)</span> is a shade or shadow. For some reason when you add <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)</span> to shade it becomes thanks to, as in thanks to you, I was able to pass the test. Just think about a shade helping you out. Perhaps <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thanks to</span> the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shade</span> you were able to survive the heat of the desert.
* The reading comes from the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [陰](https://jisho.org/search/陰)</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Thanks to</span> that other vocab word, you can read this one!
