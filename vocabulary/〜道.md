武士道と騎士道の違いについて説明してください。
* Could you please explain the difference between bushido and chivalry?
* This is a word that's attached to the end of various other words. Think of a road as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> way</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> method of</span> something. For example, the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [どう](https://jisho.org/search/どう)</span> in Judo is the soft way. There are many words that end with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [道](https://jisho.org/search/道)</span>, and you'll see them later on. For now, know that this means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> method of</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> way</span>.
* This word is added to the end of many different words, meaning it's treated like most jukugo (and uses an on'yomi reading). You know the on'yomi reading, so you should be able to read this word. Be sure to drop the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [〜](https://jisho.org/search/〜)</span> when writing in the reading in the test, though. It's only there to show that it's added onto things and not part of the correct answer.
