* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> energy</span> is ... well ... <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> different</span>. That's the nice way to put it. You're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crazy</span>, actually.<br />WARNING: We're teaching you this word because it's used quite a bit still (especially online) and we want you to be able to understand it if you see it. But please keep in mind that this is considered to be a discriminatory word against people with mental illnesses, so we strongly recommend you do not use or direct this word toward anyone. Think of it like a really inappropriate swear word that makes you really uncool if you say it. Please!
* The reading is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [気](https://jisho.org/search/気)</span> plus <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [違い](https://jisho.org/search/違い)</span>.
* 気, 違
