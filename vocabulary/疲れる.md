## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exhausted</span> making the verb version <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be exhausted</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be tired</span>. Don't confuse this with to be sleepy. No, this is a different kind of tired, like a physical or mental one, like you just worked out or studied a ton.
* For example, if you tried to lift <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two ca</span>rs (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つか](https://jisho.org/search/つか)</span>) you'd become exhausted for sure. So, think about that as you learn this word's reading.
* 疲
* Exhausted
* [sound:疲れる_b.mp3]
* [sound:疲れる_g.mp3]
