## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> needle</span> made of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gold</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wire</span>. Perhaps wires were made from gold mostly back in the day? And they were thin like needles? That's my guess.
* The reading is the kun'yomi reading of both. You've learned <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [針](https://jisho.org/search/針)</span> already, but <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [金](https://jisho.org/search/金)</span> is more like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お金](https://jisho.org/search/お金)</span>, rendaku'd.
* 針, 金
* Needle, Gold
