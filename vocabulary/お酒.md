## Mnemonics:
「割り勘にしよう。」「いや。今日は俺の奢りだよ。しかも、俺はお酒をたくさん飲んだけど、お前は一滴も飲まなかったじゃないか。」
* Let’s split the bill. No, it’s on me this time. I drank a lot of alcohol, but you didn’t drink anything
* This is just the noun version of the kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [酒](https://jisho.org/search/酒)</span> - it has an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)</span> there to be nice. This word can mean both <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alcohol</span> (same like the parent kanji) or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sake</span> (the main kind of Japanese alcohol, at least back in the kanji days).
* The reading is kun'yomi, which isn't what you learned with the kanji. But, it should be pretty easy. You know what Japanese alcohol is called already, right? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> さけ</span>, simple as that. So long as you've heard of sake you should be A-Okay with this reading.
* 酒
* Alcohol
* [sound:お酒_b.mp3]
* [sound:お酒_g.mp3]
