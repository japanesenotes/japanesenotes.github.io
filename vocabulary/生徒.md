私の趣味は、教師と生徒の禁断の愛をテーマにした本を読むことです。
* My hobby is reading books about the forbidden love between students and their teachers.
* One who is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> junior</span> in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> life</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> student</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pupil</span>. It's kind of like how a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [先生](https://jisho.org/search/先生)</span> is someone who came previous to you in life. Cool how that works, right? Okay <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [生徒](https://jisho.org/search/生徒)</span>, get back to work!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
