* Don’t take off your spacesuit! It’s one of the things that’s prohibited.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Stop</span>! That's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prohibition</span> (prohibited)! When something is prohibited and you're forced to stop, that thing is obviously <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> forbidden</span>. If you see this you should probably not do the thing it's telling you not to do.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
