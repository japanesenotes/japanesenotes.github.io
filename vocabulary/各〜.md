## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* The reading is the same as the kanji, though it's kind of like an add-on for other words in a sense, which makes it behave like jukugo, I think. Don't confuse this with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [各々](https://jisho.org/search/各々)</span> though. That one does use the kun'yomi reading, which is strange when you consider this one doesn't. Every kanji has its own perks I suppose.
* 各
* Each
* [sound:各〜_b.mp3]
