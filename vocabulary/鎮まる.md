## Mnemonics:

* 
* You already learned that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [鎮める](https://jisho.org/search/鎮める)</span> means to appease, but this one is what happens after they've been appeased. They start <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to quiet down</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.  You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />When you're in the library the librarian is always telling you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to quiet down</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> She's</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しず](https://jisho.org/search/しず)</span>) so mean! She never lets you talk in the library. Who's mean to you? She's mean to you!!
