## Mnemonics:
電車に駆け込み乗車をしようとして鼻が挟まれて、鼻血が出ました。
* I tried to rush onto the train, but the doors closed, squished my nose and made it bleed.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nose</span> with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blood</span> is a nose with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nosebleed</span>. It is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bloody nose</span>.
* The readings are the kun'yomi vocab readings. You already know <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [鼻](https://jisho.org/search/鼻)</span>'s reading from the kanji and vocab, and you should know the vocab reading of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [血](https://jisho.org/search/血)</span> as well. Put them together and you have <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はなち](https://jisho.org/search/はなち)</span>, though you want to change the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ち](https://jisho.org/search/ち)</span> to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぢ](https://jisho.org/search/ぢ)</span>. Alternatively, it's possible (though less common, but it doesn't matter if you're turning it to kanji via an IME anyways) to write it as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はなじ](https://jisho.org/search/はなじ)</span>. I guess that blood added a little tenten (it represents the blood coming out of that nose!). Spurt spurt spurt.
* 鼻, 血
* Nose, Blood
* [sound:鼻血_b.mp3]
