* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reason</span> the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> earth</span> is the way it is is because of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> geography</span> of it. Though it may seem kind of strange that geography is bringing reason to the earth, if you think of geography as a study, then you can think about how you try to get reason through that, as well.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
