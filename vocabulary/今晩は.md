## Mnemonics:
今晩は、コウイチおじさん。今日は私とフグの赤ちゃんの面倒をみてくれて有難うございます。あ、ところで、電子レンジは使わなかったよね？ 母乳だから、電子レンジ使ったらいけないんだよ。
* Good evening, Uncle Koichi. Thank you for taking care of our baby today. Hey, you didn’t microwave that, did you? Because it’s breast milk, you’re not supposed to do that.
* This is a strange one. It's like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こんにちは](https://jisho.org/search/こんにちは)</span>, which is written as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [今日は](https://jisho.org/search/今日は)</span>, oddly. Same for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> good evening</span>, which also has the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> now</span> kanji in it. Switched with day is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> night</span>. So, when you say now night! you're really saying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> good evening</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just be aware that the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span> at the end is actually the particle <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span> so it's pronounced like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わ](https://jisho.org/search/わ)</span>.
* 今, 晩
* Now, Night
* [sound:今晩は_b.mp3]
* [sound:今晩は_g.mp3]
