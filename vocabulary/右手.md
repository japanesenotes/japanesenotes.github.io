## Mnemonics:
右あし、右手、右めをつかうほうがすきだ。
* I prefer to use my right foot, right hand, and right eye.
* The kanji for right and the kanji for hand. I don't think it gets any clearer than this!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. This word, however, uses the kun'yomi readings, combined. This is possibly because of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [手](https://jisho.org/search/手)</span>, which is a body part. When a body part is present in a word, it usually changes to the kun'yomi reading for who knows what reason. Either way, both kanji use the reading you learned in this word, so you should already know it.
* 右, 手
* Right, Hand
* [sound:右手_b.mp3]
* [sound:右手_g.mp3]
