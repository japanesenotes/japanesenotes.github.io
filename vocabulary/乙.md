## Mnemonics:
こうして山頂から生まれ故郷を見渡すのも、また乙なものですねぇ。
* It’s very neat to look over my hometown from the top of the mountain.
* If something is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> latter</span>, it can't be first, it has to be at least <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> second</span>. This works for lists too. So if you have A through D, it's going to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> B</span>.
* This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
* 乙
* Latter
* [sound:乙_b.mp3]
* [sound:乙_g.mp3]
