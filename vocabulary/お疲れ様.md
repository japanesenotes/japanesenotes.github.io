## Mnemonics:

* 
* You are a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [疲れ](https://jisho.org/search/疲れ)</span> (tired) <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [様](https://jisho.org/search/様)</span> (honorific that kind of refers to whoever's being mentioned with this word). You say this to people after a day of hard work or after a good practice, etc. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お疲れ様でした](https://jisho.org/search/お疲れ様でした)</span>! I suppose the assumption here is that everyone worked until they were tired, so it was a good work, and then you thank them for it and mention how tired everyone is.
* The reading comes from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [疲れ](https://jisho.org/search/疲れ)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [様](https://jisho.org/search/様)</span>, combined together into one word.
* 疲, 様
* Exhausted, Formal Name Title
* [sound:お疲れ様_b.mp3]
* [sound:お疲れ様_g.mp3]
