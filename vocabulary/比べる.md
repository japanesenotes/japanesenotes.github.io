## Mnemonics:
主人と私は、私達の双子をできるだけ比べないようにはしていますが、やっぱり難しいですね。
* My husband and I have been trying not to compare our twins with each other, but it’s difficult.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> compare</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to compare</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Look at this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cooler</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くら](https://jisho.org/search/くら)</span>). No look at this cooler. No, wait, we need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to  compare</span> the two coolers. Think about all the features each one has and really compare, like you have a list or something.
