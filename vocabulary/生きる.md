## Mnemonics:
わたしの大好きなアニメキャラが、今生きるかしぬかのせとぎわにいる。
* My favorite anime character is currently in a critical moment between life and death.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means life, making this word mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to live</span>.
* You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> portion of this word to be able to read it. Think of it this way and you should be able to remember it, though: <br />What does it mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to live</span>? Life is pretty <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> icky</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)き</span> ... the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span> comes from the hiragana part), but you have to take that ickiness and roll with it if you want to have a good life... if you want to live!
* 生
* Life
