## Mnemonics:
「登山に行くってのはどう？」「さあ、どうしようかなあ。」
* How about we go mountain climbing? Well I don’t know about that.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Climb</span> a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mountain</span>. That is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mountain climbing</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Note this uses the alternative <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [と](https://jisho.org/search/と)</span> reading, not to be confused with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [と](https://jisho.org/search/と)う</span> (actually, very confusing, sorry!). Just imagine you cut your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> toe</span> off with an ice pick while mountain climbing. You know it's a short <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [と](https://jisho.org/search/と)</span> because your toe is now short. And <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さん](https://jisho.org/search/さん)</span> becomes <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ざん](https://jisho.org/search/ざん)</span> thanks to our old friend rendaku.
* 登, 山
* Climb, Mountain
