## Mnemonics:
「知らぬが仏」や「仏の顔も三度まで」など、仏に関する諺はいくつかありますね。
* There are some proverbs related to Buddha like, what you don’t know can’t hurt you, and, the crushed worm will turn.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You go up to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Buddha</span>. You want to rub his head for good luck, because that's what you hear is good to do. Right before you touch him, he backs off and says, Whoa! I'm <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hot, okay</span>? (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほとけ](https://jisho.org/search/ほとけ)</span>). You touch him and it burns your hand clean off. <br />Imagine saying hot, okay? in a strange accent to help you to remember.
* 仏
* Buddha
