## Mnemonics:
全くひどい息子をもったもんだよ。あいつは昨夜俺のケーキの残りをこっそり盗み食いしやがったんだ。
* I have the most beastly son. He sneakily ate up the rest of my cake last night.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> breath</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> child</span> (that lets you release your breath when it's born) is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> son</span>. Nowadays it's cool to have a girl, but back in the day you wanted a son to carry on your underwater basket weaving legacy. That's why this is a son.
* The reading of this is messed up. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span> is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span>, that should be okay. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [息](https://jisho.org/search/息)</span> is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [むす](https://jisho.org/search/むす)</span> for some reason though. Why? Because you gave birth to a son, but he was a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> moose</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [むす](https://jisho.org/search/むす)</span>). You better hold that breath again, because this is not what you wanted.
* 息, 子
* Breath, Child
