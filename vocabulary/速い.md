## Mnemonics:
うちの家族は、ご飯を食べるのがとても速いです。
* In my family, we eat dinner really fast.
* Just like the meaning of the kanji (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fast</span>) this adjective also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fast</span>.
* Remember how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [早い](https://jisho.org/search/早い)</span> means early? If you are early to something, it probably means you moved <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fast</span> to get there. These two words share a reading (and have similar meanings, in a way, as well!).
* 速
* Fast
* [sound:速い_b.mp3]
* [sound:速い_g.mp3]
