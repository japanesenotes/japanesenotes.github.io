## Mnemonics:
Tofuguの社員は、月曜日は青色、茶色、鼠色などの地味な色の服を着る事しか許されません。
* On Mondays, Tofugu workers are only allowed to wear clothes in subdued colors, like blue, light brown, and gray.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> permit</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to permit</span>. It also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to forgive</span>, in that I'll permit it this time... but only this time. Look out for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [許さない](https://jisho.org/search/許さない)</span> in TV shows, too. It means I won't permit this! or I won't forgive you!
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: I'm going to allow it. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> You're</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆる](https://jisho.org/search/ゆる)</span>) allowed to do it this one time, okay?
* 許
* Permit

* [sound:許す_g.mp3]
