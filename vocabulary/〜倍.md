## Mnemonics:
回転寿司の普及に伴い、日本におけるサーモンの消費量は輸入開始から三倍となった。
* Since the introduction and subsequent spread of conveyer belt sushi shops, salmon consumption in Japan has tripled.
* Throw this onto a number and you have yourself the number of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> times</span> something has increased. For example, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [３倍](https://jisho.org/search/３倍)</span> means something increased three fold.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Omit the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [〜](https://jisho.org/search/〜)</span> when writing out the answer, though. That just represents that there should be something before the kanji in this word when being used.
* 倍
* Double
