## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> replace</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to replace</span>. You know that you're doing the replacing because of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> air</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [える](https://jisho.org/search/える)</span>). You're replacing the air as quickly as you can because if you don't you wouldn't be able to breathe in this small room.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
* 替
* Replace
