## Mnemonics:
現金は常に身につけておく方がいい。
* You should always carry cash on you.
* The kanji is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> somebody</span>, but the word is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> body</span>. I guess somebody is somebody's body, so they are similar at least.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: Who is that somebody? Who is that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> body</span>? Why, of course it is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> me</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [み](https://jisho.org/search/み)</span>).
* 身
* Somebody
* [sound:身_b.mp3]
* [sound:身_g.mp3]
