## Mnemonics:
私は明治神宮がとっても好きなの。森が、自然の森として育つように計算して造られているので、とても美しいし、自然的な空間なの。
* I really like the Meiji Shrine because its forest was carefully designed to mimic a natural forest and because of that it’s beautiful and has a very natural atmosphere.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> raise</span> so the verb vocab version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be raised</span>. <br />P.S. This word is for when you are being raised, not when you are doing the raising of someone. That's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 育てる</span>. You'll learn it later.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />When you were raised, you were raised completely on <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soda</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そだ](https://jisho.org/search/そだ)</span>). That's all you drank. No water, no juice... just tons and tons of soda. Imagine this.
* 育
* Nurture
* [sound:育つ_b.mp3]
* [sound:育つ_g.mp3]
