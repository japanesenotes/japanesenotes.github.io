## Mnemonics:
この毛糸は24時間後に金に変わるんだけど、クリスマスプレゼントとして少しあんたにあげるよ。感謝しろよな。
* This yarn will turn into gold in 24 hours and I’ll give you some as a Christmas present, so you should appreciate me more.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji you would normally think it uses the kun'yomi reading. Not this word, though. It still uses the on'yomi reading, which you learned with the kanji. Don't confuse this one with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お金](https://jisho.org/search/お金)</span>, though. That one uses kun'yomi which you know because it has a hiragana attached.
* 金
* Gold
* [sound:金_b.mp3]
* [sound:金_g.mp3]
