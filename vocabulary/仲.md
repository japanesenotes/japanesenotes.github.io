キンニクマ：「うわ！お前らちょっと仲良すぎじゃね？」 ワニカニとトーフグ：「なんで？ただのマブダチだよ。」
* Kinnikuma: Wow! You guys have a close relationship don’t you? WaniKani and Tofugu: How so? It’s just a bromance.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* The reading is the kun'yomi reading since it's a single kanji, all alone, but this is the reading you learned with the kanji, so you should be okay and have a great relationship with this word going forward.
* 仲
* Relationship
