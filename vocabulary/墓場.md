## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grave</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> location</span> is a place where there are graves. It is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> graveyard</span>, or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cemetery</span>.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [場](https://jisho.org/search/場)</span> is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, but <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [墓](https://jisho.org/search/墓)</span> is read as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はか](https://jisho.org/search/はか)</span> here. Here's a mnemonic to help you out. When you're finally dead and buried in a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> graveyard</span>, your one wish is for the New Zealand All Blacks to do the Haka (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はか](https://jisho.org/search/はか)</span>) over your grave. If you don't know what the haka is, look it up, it's pretty neat.
* 墓, 場
* Grave, Location
