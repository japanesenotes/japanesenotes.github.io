## Mnemonics:
その映画を見終わった後で、もう一度それを見るために違う映画館へ向かった。
* After the movie, we headed across town to watch it again in another theater.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br /><span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> After</span>. Everything happens after. It's a cause and effect chain. One thing happens, and then another thing happens after. This is life. This is the universe. Everything is after. It's an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> auto</span>matic (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あと](https://jisho.org/search/あと)</span>) cycle that just keeps going and going and going. <br />You can differentiate this one from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [後ろ](https://jisho.org/search/後ろ)</span> because it has a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [で](https://jisho.org/search/で)</span> on the end. Day (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [で](https://jisho.org/search/で)</span>) follows night which follows day again, automatically.
* 後
* Behind
* [sound:後で_b.mp3]
* [sound:後で_g.mp3]
