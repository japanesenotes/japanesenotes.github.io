## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* The reading is an exception, but it isn't too hard to remember. It's the same as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 中</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なか](https://jisho.org/search/なか)</span>), so if you think about it it makes sense. It's your insides, just like your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> belly</span> is your insides!
* 腹
* Belly
* [sound:お腹_b.mp3]
* [sound:お腹_g.mp3]
