## Mnemonics:
日程の件で色々と振り回しちゃって本当にごめんね。四日なら都合がつきそうです。次は今回みたいなドタキャンは絶対しないって約束します!
* I’m really sorry to cause so much scheduling trouble. I can free up the fourth. I promise I will never cancel at the last minute like this again.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> promise</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bundle</span> is still a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> promise</span> no matter how many you have wrapped up there. One promise is just another promise which is just another promise.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 約, 束
* Promise, Bundle
