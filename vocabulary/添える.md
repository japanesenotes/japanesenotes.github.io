## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> append</span>, so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to append</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> To append</span> something to something else, you can just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sew</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そ](https://jisho.org/search/そ)</span>) it onto something else.
* 添
