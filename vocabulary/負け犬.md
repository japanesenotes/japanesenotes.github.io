## Mnemonics:
この負け犬め！キモいんだよ！
* You are a loser and really creepy!
* You've hopefully come across <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [負ける](https://jisho.org/search/負ける)</span> by now, which means to lose. So, you can figure out this word means losing dog. Well, calling someone a dog isn't so nice, so you're probably just calling them a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> loser</span>. As Ace Ventura would say: Lehuzeherrrr. LOSER.
* The readings are kun'yomi, but you should be familiar with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [負ける](https://jisho.org/search/負ける)</span> and of course <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [犬](https://jisho.org/search/犬)</span> well enough to learn the reading here.
* 負, 犬
* Lose, Dog
