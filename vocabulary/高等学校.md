## Mnemonics:
高等学校で教頭をしております。
* I’m the vice principal of a senior high school.
* Remember when you learned that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [高等](https://jisho.org/search/高等)</span> means high class and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [学校](https://jisho.org/search/学校)</span> means school? Well put them together and you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> senior high school</span>! It's the most high class school you've got (unless you go to university, but that's considered to be separate). <br />Fun fact: <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [高校](https://jisho.org/search/高校)</span> is the abbreviation of this word. Neat, right?
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
* 高, 等, 学, 校
* Tall, Equal, Study, School
* [sound:高等学校_b.mp3]
* [sound:高等学校_g.mp3]
