## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bride</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to marry</span>, because you can't really to bride someone.
* Imagine you're getting married to a valley girl. You're all like. Hey, I'm gonna marry you! And she's all like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Tots</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とつ](https://jisho.org/search/とつ)</span>), we gonna get, like, married! Imagine her saying more tots things (tots = short for totally in valley girl speak, at least in my imagination).
* 嫁
* Bride
