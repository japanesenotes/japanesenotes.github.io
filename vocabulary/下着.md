## Mnemonics:
どの下着が欲しい？植物柄？それともアニマル柄？好きなものを選んでいいよ。
* Which underwear do you want? The plant or animal patterned ones? Pick whichever one you like.
* The things you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wear</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> below</span> your other clothes. That is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> underwear</span>. You do wear underwear, right?
* The reading for this one is all kun'yomi vocab reading, but you should know these by now. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [着](https://jisho.org/search/着)</span> uses the reading you learned with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [着](https://jisho.org/search/着)る</span>, but this word employs that pesky rendaku, so remember that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span> becomes <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎ](https://jisho.org/search/ぎ)</span> here.
* 下, 着
* Below, Wear
* [sound:下着_b.mp3]
* [sound:下着_g.mp3]
