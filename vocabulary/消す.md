## Mnemonics:
教室を出た後は電気を消すのを忘れないで下さい。
* After you leave the classroom, please don’t forget to turn off the light.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> extinguish</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to extinguish</span>. You can also use this word to refer to turning something off (like lights). Technically you're extinguishing the lights or power, right?
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ke</span>ttle is getting too hot so it catches on fire. You have to extinguish the flames before your house burns down too, just because of this stupid little kettle.
* 消
* Extinguish
* [sound:消す_b.mp3]
* [sound:消す_g.mp3]
