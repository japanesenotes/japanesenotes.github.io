## Mnemonics:
ちくしょう！にせの一万円さつをつかまされた。
* Crap! I was cheated into accepting a fake 10,000 yen bill.
* When you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> one</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ten thousand</span> you just have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ten thousand</span>. In Japanese, though, you specify how many ten thousands you have, though (which is weird in English, but should make sense if you think about it).
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 一, 万
* One, Ten Thousand
* [sound:一万_b.mp3]
* [sound:一万_g.mp3]
