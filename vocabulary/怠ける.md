## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neglect</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lazy</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to neglect</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be idle</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You decide <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to neglect</span> everything. Your school, your family, even your own <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> name</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なま](https://jisho.org/search/なま)</span>). You've managed <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to slack</span> for so long that you can't even remember your name? That's pretty impressive, actually.
