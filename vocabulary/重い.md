## Mnemonics:
「足を踏んでしまってごめんなさい。」「ちょっと重かったけど、どうってことないよ。」
* I’m sorry I stepped on your foot. No problem. It was a little heavy, but no harm done.
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> heavy</span>? It's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> heavy</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You're lifting something that's really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> heavy</span>. Oof! You lift it above your head. You're so awesome. You scream: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> OH! MO</span>RE! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おも](https://jisho.org/search/おも)</span>) they put more. You yell it again: OH, MORE! and again: OH, MORE! Go ahead and act this out wherever you are, pretending like you're holding a couch or two or three over your head, saying OH MORE!
