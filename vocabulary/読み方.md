あなたの名前の漢字の読み方を教えてください。
* How do you pronounce the kanji in your name?
* You know that this has something to do with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> read</span>ing and you know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [方](https://jisho.org/search/方)</span> means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> way</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> method</span>. So, when you think of a way of reading you can think of a couple other better words, such as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reading</span> (aka the reading of a word) or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pronunciation</span>. Anytime you need to know how something sounds, this is what you'll ask for.
* The readings are the kun'yomi readings, but they're the readings you've learned with the kanji. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [方](https://jisho.org/search/方)</span> is like many other words you've come across as well, such as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [見方](https://jisho.org/search/見方)</span> or <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [作り方](https://jisho.org/search/作り方)</span>.
* 読, 方
* Read, Direction
