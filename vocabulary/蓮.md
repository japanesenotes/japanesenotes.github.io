## Mnemonics:

* 
* This isn't just any <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lotus</span>. It's THE lotus. The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Sacred Lotus</span>. When you see it blooming all alone in a murky pond, you'll know.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sacred lotus</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> has</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はす](https://jisho.org/search/はす)</span>) a strong significance (and probably some powers). It has something at least, just remember it has something special going on, and you'll be fine.
* 蓮
* Lotus
