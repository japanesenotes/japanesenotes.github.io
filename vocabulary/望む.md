## Mnemonics:
髪切ったんだけど、逆に童顔に磨きがかかっちゃってさあ。年相応のお洒落な三十五歳の女性になることを望んでたのに。。。とほほ。
* I got a haircut but it just made me look even more childish. I was hoping to look like a stylish 35-year-old woman. Boohoo.
* If you have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hope</span> and you turn it into a verb, you'd think it would be to hope. But what is really behind a hope? It's a desire or wish, right? That's why this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to wish</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to desire</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Your one wish that you have is to have a bigger <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nose</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [のぞ](https://jisho.org/search/のぞ)</span>). Feel your nose, it's too small. You wish it was two or three inches longer. Of course, if it helps to imagine you want a smaller nose or a nose at all, that's fine too. Just make sure you wish you have something nose-related.
* 望
* Hope
