## Mnemonics:

* 
* If <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [騒ぐ](https://jisho.org/search/騒ぐ)</span> is to make noise, then a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> big</span> version of this is even louder. It's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clamor</span> and an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> uproar</span>.
* This is word that uses the kun'yomi readings of the kanji, which you should know already because <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [大](https://jisho.org/search/大)</span> is pretty familiar to you by now (I hope) and you just learned <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [騒ぐ](https://jisho.org/search/騒ぐ)</span> as well! Put them together, with a little tweaking at the end, and you have your reading. Ta-da!
* 大, 騒
* Big, Boisterous
