## Mnemonics:
日曜日、僕は父と一緒に木を何本か切り倒した後、それを叩き切って薪にしました。
* My dad and I knocked down some trees and chopped them up for logs this Sunday.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> overthrow</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> collapse</span>. This is when you are doing those things to something else. If you do, you're going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to knock over</span> whatever it is you're trying to knock over.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You use the power of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Tao</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たお](https://jisho.org/search/たお)</span>) to do all of your knocking down. Imagine yourself contemplating Tao philosophy, then using those pleasant thoughts to knock everything over around you. BLAM!
