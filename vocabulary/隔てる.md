## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> isolate</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to isolate</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to partition</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to separate</span>. You get the idea, anyways.
* Why did you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to isolate</span> him from the rest of the soccer players? Because all he could do was <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> header</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [へだ](https://jisho.org/search/へだ)</span>) and that was getting pretty dangerous. He would head everything in his reach. He was going crazy with headers. He had to be isolated!
