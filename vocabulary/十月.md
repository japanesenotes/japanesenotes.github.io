## Mnemonics:
かれがおかしいのは、十月なのにすいえいにさそったわたしのせきにんだ。
* It’s my fault that he’s acting strange; I asked him to go swimming even though it is October.
* The kanji for moon and month are the same, probably because a moon cycle takes approximately a month to occur. So, what is the tenth moon cycle of the year? That would be the awesome month <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> October</span>!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.<br />Also, this is a specific month, so it uses the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がつ](https://jisho.org/search/がつ)</span> reading.
* 十, 月
* Ten, Moon
* [sound:十月_b.mp3]
* [sound:十月_g.mp3]
