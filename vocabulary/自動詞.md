「受動態にできるかどうか？」で判断すると、自動詞と他動詞が簡単に見分けられますよ。
* You can easily judge if it's an intransitive verb or a transitive verb when you think about whether or not you can change it to the passive form.
* An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> automatic</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> part of speech</span> is an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> intransitive verb</span>. Intransitive verbs are actions that just happen, aka you're not the one doing the action or thing. These are words like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [付く](https://jisho.org/search/付く)</span> or <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [消える](https://jisho.org/search/消える)</span>, where you aren't doing the action. That's why they're automatic!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 自, 動, 詞
* Self, Move, Part Of Speech
