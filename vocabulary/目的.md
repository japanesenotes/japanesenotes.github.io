私たちの目的は、一緒に楽しみながら皆さんに日本語を勉強してもらうことです。
* Our goal is to make you all have fun while studying Japanese together.
* When your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eye</span> is on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> target</span> you know your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> purpose</span>. You also have your eye on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> goal</span> (that's the target, after all!).
* The reading is a reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [目](https://jisho.org/search/目)</span> that's abnormal. You've seen this reading with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [目](https://jisho.org/search/目)標</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [目](https://jisho.org/search/目)次</span>, though, so hopefully it won't be too hard at this point. Just imagine telling someone your <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [目](https://jisho.org/search/目)的</span>, only to have them laugh in your face and begin <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mock</span>ing <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もく](https://jisho.org/search/もく)</span> you for it. Now you're not so sure if your goal is going to work.
* 目, 的
* Eye, Target
