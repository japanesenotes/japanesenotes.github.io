## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> welcome</span>, but the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to pick someone up</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to meet someone</span>. That's weird. But, think of it this way: When you go to welcome someone, you are going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to meet someone</span> too. You have to go somewhere to wait and welcome them, which is why you are going to pick someone up or going to meet them. Something like that anyways.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> To pick someone up</span> you are going to drive your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> moo ca</span>r. It's a car that's designed to look like a cow, but you think it will be a nice way to welcome your friend.
* 迎
* Welcome
