引き算を習うのは、小学校何年生ですか？
* What year of grade school will we learn subtraction?
* Remember how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [引く]([引](https://jisho.org/search/引)く)</span> means to subtract? Add <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> calculate</span> to that and you'll have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> subtraction</span>! It's the type of calculation you're doing when you subtract.
* This is the kun'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [引](https://jisho.org/search/引)</span> and the on'yomi for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [算](https://jisho.org/search/算)</span>. And the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さん](https://jisho.org/search/さん)</span> reading is rendaku'd into <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ざん](https://jisho.org/search/ざん)</span>. This is the same for all the math-ish words (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), so try to remember that, because you'll see it again!
* 引, 算
* Pull, Calculate
