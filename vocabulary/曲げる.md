* Superman can bend anything, even something that is already bent.
* This is a verb because it ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound. What does the kanji mean? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> music</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bend</span>. In the case of this word, we're going with the bend version. The verb of that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to bend</span>. This is when you're doing the bending. You can remember this because <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [げ](https://jisho.org/search/げ)</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gen</span>tleman you're bending. He looked good before you bent him in half.
