## Mnemonics:
南球場でブラッド・ピットを見た。
* I saw Brad Pitt at the south baseball stadium.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />Think about the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> south</span>. What's down there? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Mean Amy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みなみ](https://jisho.org/search/みなみ)</span>) lives down there. Think of the last mean thing she did to you and imagine it while yelling out MEAN AMYYYYY at the sky.
