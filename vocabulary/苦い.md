## Mnemonics:
カラメルは、焦がさないように気を付けてください。でないと、苦い味になってしまいます。
* Be careful not to let the caramel burn or it will taste bitter.
* The kanji for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [苦](https://jisho.org/search/苦)</span> means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suffer</span>. This word, however, is quite different. It means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bitter tasting</span>. Just think of ways you can suffer, though. Then, think of putting the most bitter thing in the world in your mouth. You feel sick, your mouth gets all weird, and you try to spit it out but the bitterness remains. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Bitter tasting</span> things are super gross.
* Like the word meaning, the reading is an exception as well. You can remember it by thinking: <br />The taste is so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bitter</span> that you fall to your knees really, really hard. Luckily, you were wearing your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> knee gua</span>rds (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にが](https://jisho.org/search/にが)</span>). Feel the relief that you were wearing them. Ack, no relief now. It's still bitter in your mouth.
* 苦
* Suffering
* [sound:苦い_b.mp3]
* [sound:苦い_g.mp3]
