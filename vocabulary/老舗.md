## Mnemonics:

* 
* An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> elderly</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shop</span> is an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> old shop</span>.
* This reading is an exception, but there is another way you can say it that uses the jukugo (on'yomi) readings instead! But to help you remember the more common, exception, here's a mnemonic:<br />If you go to an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> old shop</span> you can get what's called a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shiny sa</span>le (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しにせ](https://jisho.org/search/しにせ)</span>). A shiny sale is if you can find something in the shop that's still new and shiny it's on sale! It's hard when you're at an old shop though. And that's the challenge!
* 老, 舗
