## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sweep</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to sweep</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: While you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sweep</span> you laugh. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> HA</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span>) HA HA! Just imagine yourself doing this, or do it for real if you want to clean up a bit.
