## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> quantity</span>, but you don't to quantity. To figure out the quantity, however, you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to measure</span> / <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to weigh</span> whatever it is you want to get the quantity of.
* You need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to measure</span> the quantity of something, but don't have a scale or anything. Luckily, you are quite the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hacker</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はか](https://jisho.org/search/はか)</span>) and hack together a scale using only rubber bands and beans.
