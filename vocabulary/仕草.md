## Mnemonics:
煙草を吸う大人の仕草にドキッとした。
* I was appalled by the smoking adults’ behavior.
* Things you end up <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> doing</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grass</span> and not inside probably take a lot of big <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> action</span>s and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gesture</span>s. You have to do them outside on the grass because if you did them anywhere else you might break something.
* The reading is a combination of on'yomi and kun'yomi. That being said, both readings for both kanji are the readings you learned with the kanji so you should be able to read this. Just watch out because rendaku makes <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くさ](https://jisho.org/search/くさ)</span> become <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぐさ](https://jisho.org/search/ぐさ)</span>.
* 仕, 草
* Doing, Grass
* [sound:仕草_b.mp3]
* [sound:仕草_g.mp3]
