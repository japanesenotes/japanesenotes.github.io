## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, which means you think it ought to be an adjective, but it's not, it's a noun :( What's the noun form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> force</span>? It's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> force</span>.
* This is a rough one. There is much force behind you, so when you come at me I scream: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> EEK! OI!</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)きおい</span>), Get away from me!
