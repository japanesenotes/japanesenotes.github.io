## Mnemonics:
筏を作っている間に、俺達みんな餓死にしちまうよ！泳いで川を渡った方が無難なんじゃないか？
* In the time it takes to build a raft we’ll die of starvation! Wouldn’t it be safer to just swim across the river?
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. <br />Don't confuse this with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [〜間](https://jisho.org/search/〜間)</span> which is similar in meaning but different in reading. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [〜間](https://jisho.org/search/〜間)</span> means it's attached to something. This is a standalone word.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />In terms of intervals of time, time goes stagnant when you arrive in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ida</span>ho (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あいだ](https://jisho.org/search/あいだ)</span>). No time intervals move when you're there. Imagine this actually happening. You're looking into the state of Idaho and seeing everyone move at a snail's pace because time moves differently there. <br />If you don't know where Idaho is, you can alternatively think about a mnemonic you'd make. You say: In terms of a new mnemonic, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> I'd uhh...</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あいだ](https://jisho.org/search/あいだ)</span>) uh... I can't think of anything better, that's a hard one!
