## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ultra</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> super</span> so the verb version is what happens when do something ultra or super much. You start <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to exceed</span> the amount you were meant to do it. If you ultra drive a car, you exceed the speed limit. If you ultra study, you exceed your brain capacity. Get it?
* Who likes <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to exceed</span> everything? Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 子</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span>)! Or you, when you were a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span>. No bedtimes, parents, or other limitations could stop you! You were able to go over them all!
