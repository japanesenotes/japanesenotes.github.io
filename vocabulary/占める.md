## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> occupy</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to occupy</span>.
* What is it you want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to occupy</span> most in the whole, entire world? Your own flock of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>). Also, a fortune teller (this kanji also means fortune, remember) told you that if you occupy her sheep, you'll have good luck! Gotta do as she says!
