## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> float</span>ing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> world</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> painting</span> is what you call an ukiyo-e woodblock print in Japan. The floating world refers to an evanescent world that is impermanent (floating), just as beauty and entertainment is. Back in the day, this type of art was made into woodblock prints and paintings. Unfortunately, we don't have a name for these in English because they're so unique and special, but they come up more than you'd think, so get used to ukiyo-e!
* The readings don't really line up perfectly, but they're close (although mixed in terms of what has what reading). Take a look at the word and break everything down. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [浮](https://jisho.org/search/浮)</span> takes the kun'yomi <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うき](https://jisho.org/search/うき)</span> (from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [浮](https://jisho.org/search/浮)く</span>), <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [世](https://jisho.org/search/世)</span> also takes the kun'yomi <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よ](https://jisho.org/search/よ)</span>, and then <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [絵](https://jisho.org/search/絵)</span> takes the on'yomi <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [え](https://jisho.org/search/え)</span>. Put that all together and you have <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うき](https://jisho.org/search/うき)よえ</span>! Or if you already know the word ukiyo-e, that works too!
