* If you have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> residence</span> that's also your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> house</span>, it's still your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> residence</span>. But you probably have a lot of money if you can own your own house, so it's probably a nice, big <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mansion</span> too.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
