このデータをうまく活用して、何かできないかな。
* I don’t know if I can put this data to good use.
* What do you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> use</span> to show that a word is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lively</span>? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Conjugation</span>! Lively things are happening, so you have to conjugate your words to match. <br />It also has another meaning. When you want to actually use something lively you are making <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> practical use</span> of it. I mean, you're using it, after all. So as long as you aren't pretending to use it, it's probably practical.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
