## Mnemonics:
お父様とお母様にも、よろしくお伝えくださいね。
* Please give your mother and father my regards.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> transmit</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to transmit</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to tell</span> something.
* Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to transmit</span> a signal to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sta</span>rs (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つた](https://jisho.org/search/つた)</span>)! Trying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to tell</span> your message to anyone on earth would be too boring and too easy. Aim your message at the nearest star and transmit it into space!
* 伝
* Transmit
