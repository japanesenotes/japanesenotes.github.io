## Mnemonics:
そのおとこは、ゆきのように白いので、白ゆきおとことなづけられた。
* The man was as white as snow, so he was named Snow White.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:<br />The word sheer means: A very fine or diaphanous fabric or article. When you think of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sheer</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しろ](https://jisho.org/search/しろ)</span>) piece of fabric, I think you generally think of a white piece of fabric. 
* 白
