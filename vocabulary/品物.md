品物が到着次第、ご連絡差し上げます。
* As soon as the item arrives, I'll contact you.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> product</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thing</span> is any type of general <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> goods</span>. It's about as specific as you can get when you're talking about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thing</span>s like this.
* Think of it like a video game. The first time you see new <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> goods</span> there's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sheen</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しな](https://jisho.org/search/しな)</span>) about it. But when you bring it back to your place, the sheen is gone. Then when you go back to the store, wow! All the goods you don't already own have that sheen! Gotta buy them!
