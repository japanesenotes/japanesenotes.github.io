## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word takes the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reason</span> meaning of the kanji, making it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reason</span>. What's the reason for it having two meaning? You've got me, I have no clue.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this meaning, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />What's your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reason</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wake</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わけ](https://jisho.org/search/わけ)</span>) up this morning? Think about it. Now think of your reason to wake up tomorrow. What is it?
