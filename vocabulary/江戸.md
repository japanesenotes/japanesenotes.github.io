## Mnemonics:

* 
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bay</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> door</span> isn't what you might think, it refers to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Edo</span>, which is what Tokyo was called back in the day. You'll still see references to it everywhere, though, so it's good to learn. You can also call this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Tokyo</span> if you want, but I'd prefer if you answered Edo, instead.
* The readings are the ones you learned with the kanji. Of course, it will be easy if you know the word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Edo</span> already.
* 江, 戸
* Inlet, Door
* [sound:江戸_b.mp3]
