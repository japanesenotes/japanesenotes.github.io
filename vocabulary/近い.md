## Mnemonics:
アメリカのビールって、カヌーの上ででんぐり返しをするみたいなものだよね。超水に近いんだもん。
* Drinking American beer is like doing somersaults in a canoe. It’s too close to water.
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> near</span>? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> close</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nearby</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちか](https://jisho.org/search/ちか)</span> portion to be able to read this word. Imagine someone <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> close</span> to you... Too close. They are so close to you that they're touching their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cheek</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちか](https://jisho.org/search/ちか)</span>) to your cheek. Feel the cheek on yours, it's getting awkward.
