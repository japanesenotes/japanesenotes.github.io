失敬、失敬、通らせて。借金取りに追われているんだ。
* Excuse me, excuse me. I’m trying to get through here. I’m running away from a debt collector.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> money</span> (and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gold</span>) you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> borrow</span> is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> debt</span>. Be sure to pay it back before the yakuza come for you.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゃく](https://jisho.org/search/しゃく)</span> gets shortened to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゃっ](https://jisho.org/search/しゃっ)</span> though, so beware. Just think of that like the little bit that you lost to the yakuza, because they weren't happy you didn't pay back your debt. *cut*
* 借, 金
* Borrow, Gold
* [sound:借金_b.mp3]
* [sound:借金_g.mp3]
