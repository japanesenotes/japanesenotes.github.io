## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: You walk up to the boundary. You're there to pick something up to take it across. This thing you're smuggling across the boundary is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sockeye</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さかい](https://jisho.org/search/さかい)</span>) salmon. You take it across the boundary and sell it for a big profit.
