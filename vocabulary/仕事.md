## Mnemonics:
「時間内に、この仕事を終えられると思うか？」「さあ、それはどうかな。」
* Do you think we can finish this work in time? Well I wouldn’t bet on it.
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> doing</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> action</span>s are the things you do. What do you say when someone asks what you do? You tell them what your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> job</span> is.
* This word uses the on'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [仕](https://jisho.org/search/仕)</span> and the kun'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [事](https://jisho.org/search/事)</span>. Please note that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [事](https://jisho.org/search/事)</span> uses the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こと](https://jisho.org/search/こと)</span>, which you didn't learn with the kanji, but you have come across it once or twice by now, and because of the way rendaku works, it's changed to the voiced <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ごと](https://jisho.org/search/ごと)</span>.
* 仕, 事
* Doing, Action
* [sound:仕事_b.mp3]
