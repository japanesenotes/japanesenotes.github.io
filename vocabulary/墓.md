## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* When you finally have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grave</span> and you're dead and buried, your one wish is for the New Zealand All Blacks to do the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Haka</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はか](https://jisho.org/search/はか)</span>) over your grave. If you don't know what the haka is, look it up, it's pretty neat.
