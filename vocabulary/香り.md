* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fragrance</span> you smell is somebody's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 顔</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かお](https://jisho.org/search/かお)</span>).
