## Mnemonics:
「これ以上は安くできないよ。嫌ならやめて帰ってくれ。」 「分かったよ。買うことにするよ。」
* That’s my final offer. If you don’t like it stop coming back. Alright, alright. I’ll take it.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* The reading for this word is pretty weird. It's different than the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [嫌い](https://jisho.org/search/嫌い)</span> word you will see in this level too. It is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> いや</span>, so when you think of something you dislike, just think <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> iyah</span>, I dislike it. Also, think about that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eww</span> feeling it gives you when you think of the thing you dislike most.
* 嫌
* Dislike
* [sound:嫌_b.mp3]
* [sound:嫌_g.mp3]
