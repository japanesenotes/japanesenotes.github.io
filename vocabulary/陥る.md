## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cave in</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to cave in</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to collapse</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />The cave you're hanging around in is about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to cave in</span>! Right as you're about to get crushed you scream, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Oh CHEESE</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おちい](https://jisho.org/search/おちい)</span>)!! You can't swear for real or you'll go to hell when this cave in crushes you to death. And OH CHEESE felt right as your last words.
