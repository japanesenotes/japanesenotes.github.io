「じゃあ、あなたは昨夜飲み放題に行っていた訳ですね。他には何かしましたか？」「いや、まあそんなところだよ。」
* So, you went to an all you can drink place last night. Anything else? No, that’s about it.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Drink</span>ing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> as much as you want</span> is nice and all, but don't get sick. When you see this word, you know you're at an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> all you can drink</span> place. Tip: Usually there's a time limit, so drink up!
* The reading comes from the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [放題](https://jisho.org/search/放題)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほうだい](https://jisho.org/search/ほうだい)</span>) and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [飲む](https://jisho.org/search/飲む)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [のむ](https://jisho.org/search/のむ)</span>).
