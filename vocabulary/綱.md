* The kanji is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cable</span> but this word refers to more of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rope</span>, which is pretty similar. That being said, it's often used to talk about a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sumo belt</span>, so just think about that one.
