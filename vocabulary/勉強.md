英語の勉強、頑張って下さいね。私も日本語をずっと勉強しているので苦労はよくわかります。
* Keep up your English language studies. I’m always working on my Japanese too, so I know how hard it is.
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exertion</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> strong</span>. You'd think this means you're working hard or something, but it means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> studies</span> (like studies you have for a test or something). So for this, just imagine yourself exerting yourself really strongly on your homework. These are your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> studies</span> / what you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> study</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 勉, 強
* Exertion, Strong
