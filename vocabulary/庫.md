## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> warehouse</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> warehouse</span>, but this usually refers to a traditional style of Japanese warehouse, not a modern warehouse.
* What do you put in your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> warehouse</span>? Nothing that nice. Just your totally <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cra</span>shed (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くら](https://jisho.org/search/くら)</span>) car. So sad, it was a nice car, too and now it's all crashed and stored in your warehouse.
