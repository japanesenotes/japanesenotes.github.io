* Among Tofugu readers, how many are Japanese language learners?
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> read</span>ing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> someone</span> is someone who is reading. They are the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reader</span> (of a book, blog, article, etc).
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [読](https://jisho.org/search/読)</span> is the on'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. This reading is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [どく](https://jisho.org/search/どく)</span>, and you can remember it by thinking about how you are the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reader</span>, and as the reader you choose where to read. For you, the best place to read is a peaceful <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [どく](https://jisho.org/search/どく)</span>). Sit on the dock and relax. Be the reader.
