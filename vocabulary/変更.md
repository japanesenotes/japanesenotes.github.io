## Mnemonics:

* 
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> change</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> again</span>. This is more along the lines of an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alteration</span>, because you changed once in order to get to where you are, and then you get changed again to become altered, which is why it's an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alteration</span> (though <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> change</span> works too).
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 変, 更
* Change, Again
