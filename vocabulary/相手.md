## Mnemonics:
馬鹿な話し相手は欲しくない。
* I don’t want a stupid talking companion.
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mutual</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hand</span> is someone else's hands (or just someone else, if you remembered that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [手](https://jisho.org/search/手)</span> can also refer to a person as well). Whose hands are these? These are your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> partner</span>'s hands. That's why everything is mutual.
* The readings are the kun'yomi readings. For <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [手](https://jisho.org/search/手)</span>, that's no problem for you. For <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [相](https://jisho.org/search/相)</span>, that's more of an issue since you learned the on'yomi reading for it. Think of it this way: <br />Your partner wouldn't be your partner without you. Your partner is: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> I</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あい](https://jisho.org/search/あい)</span>) and you. Remember that as you gaze into your partner's eyes. I and you.
* 相, 手
* Mutual, Hand
