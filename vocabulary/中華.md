* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [中国]([中](https://jisho.org/search/中)国)</span> is China, right? That's what this <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [中](https://jisho.org/search/中)</span> represents. And, of course the Chinese are known for being super showy, which is why you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> showy</span> there.
