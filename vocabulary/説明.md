## Mnemonics:
ごめん。さっぱり分からないよ。要約すると、説明の趣旨は何なの？
* I’m sorry, I don’t understand at all. What does your explanation mean?
* When you make your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> theory</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bright</span> (and clear and easy to understand) you must have come up with an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> explanation</span> for it. Before it was dark and murky in everyone's mind. But, when you give your explanation, it gets bright and easy to understand! Yay!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 説, 明
* Theory, Bright
