## Mnemonics:
水着はありますか？とびきりセクシーなのを探しているんですが。
* Do you have swimsuits? I’m looking for a super sexy one.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> water</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wear</span> that you wear is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> swim suit</span>.
* The reading for this one is all kun'yomi vocab reading, but you should know these by now. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [着](https://jisho.org/search/着)</span> uses the reading you learned with the kanji, but this word employs that pesky rendaku, so remember that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span> becomes <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎ](https://jisho.org/search/ぎ)</span> here.
* 水, 着
* Water, Wear
* [sound:水着_b.mp3]
* [sound:水着_g.mp3]
