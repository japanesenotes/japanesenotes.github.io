* You have four and you have thousand. Multiply them together and you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> four thousand</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. That's true for the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [千](https://jisho.org/search/千)</span> part, but the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [四](https://jisho.org/search/四)</span> reading is kun'yomi. You should know how to read this word as long as you've been studying your kanji!
* 四, 千
