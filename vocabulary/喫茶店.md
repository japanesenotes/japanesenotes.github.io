## Mnemonics:
「去年、ブラジルの喫茶店で偶然コウイチに会ったよ。」 「本当？ そう言えば、長いことあいつの顔見てないなぁ。」
* Last year I ran into Koichi in a cafe in Brazil. Oh, really? Now that you mention it, I haven’t seen him in years.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tea</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shop</span> where you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> consume</span> (tea) is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tea house</span>. Welcome! Sit down. Relax. Have some tea.
* The readings are what you'd expect except for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きつ](https://jisho.org/search/きつ)</span> getting shortened to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きっ](https://jisho.org/search/きっ)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [茶](https://jisho.org/search/茶)</span>, which has this strange <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)</span> reading. To remember that it's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)</span> instead of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちゃ](https://jisho.org/search/ちゃ)</span>, think of this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tea house</span> you're going in. You think it's nice and pleasant, and it is for a while... until someone starts working a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> saw</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)</span>) outside, ruining the atmosphere. BEWWEEEEHHHEEEHHHHHE gatatatatatat BWEEEHEEE.
