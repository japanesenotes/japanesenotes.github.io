## Mnemonics:
ああ、よかった！地下鉄に乗り遅れちゃうかと思ったよ。
* What a relief! I thought I missed the subway train.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> iron</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> below</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ground</span> isn't a deposit of iron. It's man made. And what is made of iron? Trains and subways. In this case, because it's underground, it's definitely a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> subway</span>, though.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 地, 下, 鉄
* Earth, Below, Iron
