* You know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [芸術](https://jisho.org/search/芸術)</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> art</span> so you'd think that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [芸術](https://jisho.org/search/芸術)家</span> would be something like art house. Well, it's not. Think of it this way: Who is the person who works for House Art? It's the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> artist</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
