しばらくぶりに会った友達の言葉つきが随分変わっていてびっくりした。
* I was surprised by how much my friend's language had changed in the time since I'd seen him.
* Remember how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [言葉](https://jisho.org/search/言葉)</span> means language? Well when you add <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つき](https://jisho.org/search/つき)</span> to the end of it you end up talking the whole time the moon (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つき](https://jisho.org/search/つき)</span>) is out and paying more attention to your own <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> speech</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wording</span>.
* The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You've learned both of these readings by now so you should be able to read this on your own.
