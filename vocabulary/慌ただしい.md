## Mnemonics:
出発が慌ただしく、コーヒーも飲めなかった。
* It was a hasty departure. I didn't even get to drink a cup of coffee.
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> all the way at the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Confused</span> is already an adjective and this word is a little different. Usually when you get confused it's because you were already <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hurried</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> busy</span>, and things were <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hectic</span>. So this adjective is what causes your confusion.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You've learned this reading, so you should be able to read this already!
* 慌
* Confused
* [sound:慌ただしい_b.mp3]
