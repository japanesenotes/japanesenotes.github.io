## Mnemonics:

* 
* Even if you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> follow</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> all</span> the people you've ever met, you're still <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> follow</span>ing them. Once a follower, always a follower.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [追](https://jisho.org/search/追)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />They get you to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> follow</span> them by yelling <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> SOOEY</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つい](https://jisho.org/search/つい)</span>)! You certainly aren't a pig, but something about hearing them yell sooey makes you feel like you have to follow them. 
* 追, 随
* Follow, All
* [sound:追随_b.mp3]
* [sound:追随_g.mp3]
