## Mnemonics:
「あなたとその建物を一緒に見に行きたいと思うのですが、いつがご都合よろしいですか？」「ええっと、あなたのご都合に合わせますよ。」
* I’d like to go see the building with you so when would be convenient for you? Well, I’ll adjust my schedule accordingly.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thing</span> you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> build</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> building</span>. There aren't too many other things you build, at least not to this extent.
* The reading is a bit weird. It's kun'yomi readings across the board, meaning your knowledge of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [建てる](https://jisho.org/search/建てる)</span> hopefully can come into play here. A building is something you build, so how do you say to build? It's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [建てる](https://jisho.org/search/建てる)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たてる](https://jisho.org/search/たてる)</span>). Since it's a thing you build, it's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> たてもの</span>. This reading is a bit confusing, but hopefully after a while you'll get it if you get it wrong too many times! Maybe if you think about the building you're in and call it a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [建物](https://jisho.org/search/建物)</span> a few times it'll sink in better?
* 建, 物
* Build, Thing
