## Mnemonics:
今度は、お父さんの方を向いて、どうして赤ちゃんの格好をしているのか聞いてみましょう。
* Now, let’s turn toward your dad and ask him why he’s wearing a baby costume.
* You know that the kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yonder</span>, which is like over there. This is the verb version of yonder. That being said, to yonder isn't really a thing, so you have to think of what happens when you look yonder. This word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to face</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to turn toward</span>. You're looking yonder, but you have to turn towards said yonder to look that way.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You turn <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to face</span> a new direction and look out into the distance. There is a single cow out there. It turns to face you too, and says <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> moo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [む](https://jisho.org/search/む)</span>).
* 向
* Yonder
