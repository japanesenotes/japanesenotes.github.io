## Mnemonics:
ああ、あなたは色盲なんですか。ということは、どっちが赤色でどっちが緑色かを指すことはできませんね。
* Oh, you’re color blind, eh? So that means you can’t point at which one is red and which one is green, then.
* The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> finger</span>. So, if you to finger something, what are you doing? You're pointing. That's why this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to point</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You are pointing at something in fear. It is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> saw</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)</span>). Thing is, you're pointing at this saw with a missing finger. It just cut off your finger and you're freaking out, trying to point with a bloody non-finger.
* 指
* Finger
