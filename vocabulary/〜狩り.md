## Mnemonics:

* 
* You know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [狩り](https://jisho.org/search/狩り)</span> is hunting already. This is the same thing (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hunting</span>). Difference is this one is attached to other words to specify what kind of hunting you're doing.
* The reading is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [狩り](https://jisho.org/search/狩り)</span>, so if you know that you'll know this, no need to hunt for the reading of this word.
