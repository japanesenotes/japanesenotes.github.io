## Mnemonics:
テストの最初の質問の答え、何て書いた？「名前をここに書きなさい」ってやつだよ。自分の名前を書き込んだ？それとも「名前」ってそこに書いた？
* What did you write as an answer for the first question on the test? The one that said, Write Name Here. Did you put down your own name or did you just write name?
* You can guess this is a noun version of the kanji because the hiragana sticking out of it isn't an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span>-related sound or an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>-related sound. So, what is the noun version of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> answer</span>? It's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> answer</span>.
* The reading is kun'yomi, but this is also the reading you learned with the kanji so you should be able to read this and then give your <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [答え](https://jisho.org/search/答え)</span> correctly.
* 答

* [sound:答え_b.mp3]
