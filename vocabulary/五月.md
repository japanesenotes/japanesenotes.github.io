## Mnemonics:
五月に川へいきます。
* I’m going to a river in May.
* The moon kanji also represents a month, so when you have five of these months, what month of the year is it? That would be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> May</span>, the greatest month of the year (because it has towel day in it!).
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Also, this is a specific month, so it uses the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がつ](https://jisho.org/search/がつ)</span> reading.
* 五, 月
* Five, Moon
* [sound:五月_b.mp3]
* [sound:五月_g.mp3]
