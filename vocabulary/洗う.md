## Mnemonics:
ああ、私達は無洗米を使ってるので、洗う必要は無いですよ。
* Oh, we're using pre-washed rice, so you don’t need to wash it.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wash</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to wash</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to wash</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a ro</span>ck (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あら](https://jisho.org/search/あら)</span>) you found. It looks shiny, but you can't tell until you wash it.
* 洗
* Wash
* [sound:洗う_b.mp3]
