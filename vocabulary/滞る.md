## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stagnate</span>. The verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be overdue</span>. This is probably because something that has stagnated is running late, and therefore causes it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be overdue</span>.
* The reading for this one is wildsauce. I'm going to leave this one to your capable hands. Just think of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Tod</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とど](https://jisho.org/search/とど)</span>) and some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coo</span>t (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こお](https://jisho.org/search/こお)</span>) doing something wild even though they're overdue for something else, or something. Anyways, best of luck to you on this one.
