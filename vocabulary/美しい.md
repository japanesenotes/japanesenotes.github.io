## Mnemonics:
なんてこった、君の目は宝石のように美しいよ、クリスティーン。
* Oh my, your eyes are as beautiful as jewels, Christine.
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beauty</span>? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beautiful</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you. It's a long reading for a mnemonic, but try your best. <br />You look at someone who is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beautiful</span>. What an easy life they've lived. No hard work and all they do is pamper themselves to stay beautiful. Feel disgusted. You walk up to this person and say: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> U too cushy</span>! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うつくしい](https://jisho.org/search/うつくしい)</span>). <br />Sorry for adding the whole word in there for the reading mnemonic, but I thought it worked out better that way. Just know that the word isn't <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うつくしい](https://jisho.org/search/うつくしい)しい</span> or something weird like that. The hiragana on the end is part of the mnemonic as well.
