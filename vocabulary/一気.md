## Mnemonics:
僕のひいお婆さんは、ぎょう子を二百こ一気にたべた。
* My great-grandma ate two hundred gyoza in one sitting.
* It's weird to think of having <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> one</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> energy</span>. But, what gives you energy? You do it one time every couple of seconds. That would be taking breaths. So, one energy is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> one breath</span>.
* The reading is the same as the ones you learned with the individual kanji, though <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いち](https://jisho.org/search/いち)</span> from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [一](https://jisho.org/search/一)</span> is shortened to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いっ](https://jisho.org/search/いっ)</span>.
* 一, 気
* One, Energy
* [sound:一気_b.mp3]
* [sound:一気_g.mp3]
