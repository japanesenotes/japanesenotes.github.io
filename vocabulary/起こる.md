## Mnemonics:
「ねぇ、僕にキスしたい？」「ありえない。100万年経ってもあんたとキスなんて絶対にしたくないから。天地がひっくり返っても、起こりっこないよ。」
* Hey, do you want to kiss me? Absolutely no way would I ever want to kiss you in a million years. That would never happen even if heaven and earth were turned upside down.
* You know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [起きる](https://jisho.org/search/起きる)</span> means to wake up. This word, however, means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to occur</span>. Think of it this way. When an action wakes up in a way it is occurring as well. That's why this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to occur</span>. Just imagine a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> core</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こる](https://jisho.org/search/こる)</span>) of uranium just occurring out of nowhere to help you to remember this word.
* The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji and the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [起きる](https://jisho.org/search/起きる)</span> too, meaning you should be able to put together the reading on your own.
* 起
* Wake Up
* [sound:起こる_b.mp3]
* [sound:起こる_g.mp3]
