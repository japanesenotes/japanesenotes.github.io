* What is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> milk</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neck</span>? Think about where milk comes from. Now, think of what looks like a little neck on the thing that milk comes from. What is that thing? It's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nipple</span>.
* The reading for this one is an exception, at least for the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [乳](https://jisho.org/search/乳)</span> part. It's read as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ち](https://jisho.org/search/ち)</span>, and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [首](https://jisho.org/search/首)</span> is read as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くび](https://jisho.org/search/くび)</span>. You can remember the reading of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nipple</span> by thinking of a very special nipple you have on your face. A bee has burrowed into your cheek, and it squirts out milk from its butt, which sticks out of your cheek. You can't get it out, so you've decided to call this little cheek bee nipple your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cheek bee</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ち](https://jisho.org/search/ち)くび</span>).
