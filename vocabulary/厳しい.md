## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> strict</span>? It is also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> strict</span>.
* The most <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> strict</span> creature in Japan is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key bee</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きび](https://jisho.org/search/きび)</span>). Little key bees have to be very strict about locking the doors to their hive. If they aren't strict enough, the scary Japanese hornets will get in and kill them all. Have you seen those things? They're terrifying!
