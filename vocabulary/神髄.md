* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> marrow</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> god</span> contains their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> essence</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spirit</span>. I don't know how you found that out, it was probably really dangerous. You shouldn't mess with gods.
