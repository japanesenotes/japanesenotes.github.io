## Mnemonics:

* 
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sleep</span> like a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> monk</span>, as in you never stop sleeping (because you sleep while you meditate). When you sleep like a monk like this you constantly <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> oversleep</span>, probably because you're up late doing sutras or something. I have no idea why monks wake up late, but figure something out to make this stick in your brain cage.
