## Mnemonics:

* 
* This one is a little strange. You have <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [混じる]([混](https://jisho.org/search/混)じる)</span> (to get mixed up in), <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [混ぜる]([混](https://jisho.org/search/混)ぜる)</span> (to mix), <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [混ざる]([混](https://jisho.org/search/混)ざる)</span> (to get mixed), and now this: <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [混む]([混](https://jisho.org/search/混)む)</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be crowded</span>. It makes sense that when everyone's all mixed up it's going to be crowded, but how to differentiate between this and the other <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [混](https://jisho.org/search/混)</span> words? Just think of how cows <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> muuuuu</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [む](https://jisho.org/search/む)</span>) get all bunched up and crowded, which is why this word is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be crowded</span>.
* Hey, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> come</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こむ](https://jisho.org/search/こむ)</span>) out of that crowd of cows. It's going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be crowded</span> in there.
