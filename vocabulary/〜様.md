トーフグのコウイチ様御一行九名様ですね。お席のご用意ができましたのでどうぞ。
* Mr. Koichi from Tofugu, party of nine. Your table is ready.
* Add this onto the end of someone's name. It's probably too polite, to be honest, unless you're talking to one of your customers or something. It's good to know, but you're probably not going to use it, despite seeing and hearing it fairly often.
* The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji.
* 様
* Formal Name Title
* [sound:〜様_b.mp3]
