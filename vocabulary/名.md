## Mnemonics:
まだ彼女の名も知らない。
* I still don’t know her name.
* This vocabulary word is the same as the 'name' meaning of the kanji. If you can remember that, you'll have no trouble remembering this word as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: Just think of the first part of the English word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> name</span>. What is it? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> na</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [な](https://jisho.org/search/な)</span>), just like this word!
* 名
* Name
* [sound:名_b.mp3]
* [sound:名_g.mp3]
