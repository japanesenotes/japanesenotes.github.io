## Mnemonics:
わたしはへんがおをつくるのが上手です。
* I’m good at making funny faces.
* Think of someone holding out their hand. This is average. Things rated below the hand are things you're bad at. Things rated above the hand are things you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> good at</span>.
* Both of these kanji use on'yomi reading, though <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [手](https://jisho.org/search/手)</span> uses an on'yomi reading you didn't learn with the kanji. It's a rare reading, so it wasn't included (and we just have to deal with exceptions like this as we go along). To remember the reading for this word, here's a mnemonic:<br />What are you good at? You're really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> good at</span> taking <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Jou</span>rm (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょう](https://jisho.org/search/じょう)</span>) to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> zoo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ず](https://jisho.org/search/ず)</span>). No one else can take Jourm to the zoo, he gets mad and throws them into the animal enclosures. But you? Jourm trusts you.
* 上, 手
* Above, Hand
