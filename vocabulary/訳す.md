## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> translate</span> so the verb version would be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to translate</span>.
* The reading for the kanji part is surprisingly the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [やく](https://jisho.org/search/やく)</span> you learned with it, even you wouldn't expect that. I suppose that's the kind of thing you have to look forward to if you were to go into translating.
