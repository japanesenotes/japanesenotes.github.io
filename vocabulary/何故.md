## Mnemonics:

* 
* When you want to know <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> what</span> the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> circumstances</span> are around you, you have to ask <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> why</span>. Why do things happen around you? Asking why is very important if you want to understand the world.
* The reading for this is an exception. The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [何](https://jisho.org/search/何)</span> is just the first <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [な](https://jisho.org/search/な)</span> from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [な](https://jisho.org/search/な)に</span>. You can remember the second part this way:<br />No one knows quite <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> how</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> why</span> that big <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ze</span>ppelin (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぜ](https://jisho.org/search/ぜ)</span>) crashed in the 1930s. People are still asking today and no one has any answers. We have to keep asking until we get some.
* 何, 故
* What, Circumstance
