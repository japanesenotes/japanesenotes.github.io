年末でお忙しいとは存じますが、この記事を読んで頂ければ嬉しく存じます。
* This article will be posted during the busy end of the season, but I would appreciate it if you could read it.
* This is like a fancy and humble way of saying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to know</span>. Sure, the kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suppose</span>, but think of it this way... When you say I suppose it's like a humble way of saying I know. You're not being as direct about it this way, and in Japanese, that makes you more humble and polite. So, that's why <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [存じる](https://jisho.org/search/存じる)</span> means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to know</span>.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. If you remember the kanji reading, you'll have no problem remembering this vocabulary reading as well!
* 存
* Exist
* [sound:存じる_b.mp3]
* [sound:存じる_g.mp3]
