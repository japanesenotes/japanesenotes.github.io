## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wife</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> person</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lady</span>, because I guess ladies are wife people? I'm guessing this is pretty sexist somewhere, somehow, but words were made a long time ago so hopefully you can give all those dead people a break.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 婦, 人
* Wife, Person
