## Mnemonics:
この部屋は冷蔵庫、洗濯機付きです。
* This room is furnished with a refrigerator and a washing machine.
* You know that the kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [付](https://jisho.org/search/付)</span> means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attach</span> and words like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [付](https://jisho.org/search/付)く</span> mean to be attached. This has the same idea. When you see this attached to another word, for example, you might know that something is attached to something else, or perhaps <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> included</span> with it. For example, if you stay at a hotel room, maybe it is a breakfast<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [付](https://jisho.org/search/付)き</span>, i.e. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> including</span> breakfast.
* The reading comes from the reading of the kanji as well as from words like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [付](https://jisho.org/search/付)く</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [付](https://jisho.org/search/付)ける</span>.
