## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> purple</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> color</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> violet</span> color, mainly, for some reason, though I'll let purple slide as well.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [紫](https://jisho.org/search/紫)</span> is different from the one you learned with the kanji. To remember this reading, think about how the previous village you went to was all purple. It was the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 村先</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [むらさき](https://jisho.org/search/むらさき)</span>) that you went to. Everything. Absolutely everything was purple.
