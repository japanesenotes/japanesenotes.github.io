## Mnemonics:
五年前、神風が吹き、コウイチはビエトの軍隊を海岸から後退させた。
* Five years ago, Koichi drove Viet’s troops back from his shores where they were swallowed up by a divine wind.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Wind</span> of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Gods</span>. These are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> divine winds</span>. More popularly, this is a word known as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kamikaze</span>, which became known because of the kamikaze pilots during WWII. This was used before WWII, though, when the entire Mongol fleet was destroyed by a storm, preventing an invasion of Japan. How lucky.
* The readings are kun'yomi readings for both, probably because this is two words put together into one. You know the reading of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [風](https://jisho.org/search/風)</span> from previous levels, hopefully. Now all you need to do is apply your knowledge of the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [神](https://jisho.org/search/神)</span> to be able to read the rest.
* 神, 風
* God, Wind
