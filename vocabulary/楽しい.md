## Mnemonics:
飛行機から飛び降りるって、物凄く楽しいよ！
* Jumping out of an airplane is so much fun!
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pleasure</span>? Well, you could say it's pleasurable, but I'm afraid that's not what we're going for here. In this case, this word is a little more innocent. It just means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fun</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />How much <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fun</span> did you have? You just had a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ton o'</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たの](https://jisho.org/search/たの)</span>) fun!
* 楽
* Comfort
* [sound:楽しい_b.mp3]
* [sound:楽しい_g.mp3]
