先生は、日本語が話せると、卒業生の就職の可能性が高くなると思いますか？
* Teacher, do you think that being able to speak Japanese increases a graduate’s chances of finding a job?
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> business</span> of you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> graduating</span> is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> graduation</span>. If you think about it, it's kind of a big business, getting you graduated from expensive schools. The graduation business focuses on graduations, and getting you there (hint: this business is a school, probably).
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
