## Mnemonics:
トーフグの風習に、河豚の形に切りとった紙を、コウイチの誕生日に川に流すというものがあります。
* A Tofugu custom involves cutting paper into the shape of fugu and setting them afloat down a stream on Koichi’s birthday.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stream</span>, but what in the world could to stream be (remember, there weren't streams of StarCraft II games back in the day when this word was made up)? Well, let's think water. If you're streaming water, it's going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to flow</span>. Alternatively, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to flush</span> works too.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: What do you do with someone who is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nagger</span> (one who nags)? You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to flush</span> them down the toilet. Imagine someone nagging you to do your chores so you flush them down the toilet, somehow.
