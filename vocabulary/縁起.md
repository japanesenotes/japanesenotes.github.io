## Mnemonics:

* 
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> edge</span> of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wake up</span> is right before you wake up. And, by wake up I mean you're about the wake up to the truth. But, you're only at the edge, so for now what you see is an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> omen</span>... an omen that will show the truth.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. Just remember that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [起](https://jisho.org/search/起)</span> is rendaku'd and becomes <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎ](https://jisho.org/search/ぎ)</span> here. 
* 縁, 起
* Edge, Wake Up
