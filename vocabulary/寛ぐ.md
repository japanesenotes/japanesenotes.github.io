## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tolerance</span>, so the verb version is what happens when you're a really tolerant person. You're able <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to relax</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to feel at home</span> because nothing really gets to you.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to relax</span> so you go down to old <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coots ro</span>ad (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くつろ](https://jisho.org/search/くつろ)</span>). It's a road with a bunch of old coots who don't bother nobody. They just kinda sit around and complain. That's where you like to relax. Something about being surrounded by a bunch of old coots on old coots road makes you feel at home.
