## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are almost exactly the same, but instead of just meaning <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> again</span> it also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> furthermore</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> moreover</span>. This is one of those good paragraph-starting essay words!
* The reading is a bit different from what you learned with the kanji, though. Just think about how <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> again</span> he dropped the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 皿</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さら](https://jisho.org/search/さら)</span>). Wow, what a screw up. Again and again.
* 更
* Again
