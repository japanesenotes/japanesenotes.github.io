## Mnemonics:
このフグの刺し身の味、最高だよ！まさにこれだって感じだね！
* This blowfish sashimi tastes is amazing! Just what I wanted!
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />You may have the ability to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> taste</span> things now, but just wait until you get up there in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> age</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あじ](https://jisho.org/search/あじ)</span>). You'll find that the tastes and flavors you once liked will become bland, and you'll need a lot of Sriracha to make things taste better.
