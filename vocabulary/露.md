## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* This word uses the kun'yomi reading of the kanji, but you haven't learned it yet. Here's a mnemonic to help you:<br /><span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Dew</span> is just the earth's way of giving water <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to you</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つゆ](https://jisho.org/search/つゆ)</span>). Rain is too forceful, you may not go to the ocean or a lake, so the earth gives dew to you by putting it on the grass outside your house everyday!
* 露
* Expose
* [sound:露_b.mp3]
* [sound:露_g.mp3]
