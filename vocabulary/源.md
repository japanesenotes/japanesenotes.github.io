## Mnemonics:

* 
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> origin</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> origin</span>, but it also refers to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ground spring</span>s, where the origin of water comes from.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: Think of how this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ground spring</span> is everyone's (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [皆](https://jisho.org/search/皆)</span>) origin (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [元](https://jisho.org/search/元)</span>). Everyone can use it, it's the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [皆](https://jisho.org/search/皆)元</span>!
