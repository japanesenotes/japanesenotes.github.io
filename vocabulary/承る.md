## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a weird word. It's like confirming you heard and understand something, but doesn't mean you agree. So, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to consent</span> isn't 100% accurate. So, it's kind of like saying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to hear</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be informed</span>.
* You received (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [受けた](https://jisho.org/search/受けた)</span>) some information. Now, you are going to take that information that you received and then revolve it (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [回る](https://jisho.org/search/回る)</span>) around in your head to think about it. Hmmm... hmm... Ok, I like what I'm hearing. I am going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to consent</span> what it is you said. I am going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be informed</span> now that I received the information and have revolved it around my brain a bit. Thank you.
