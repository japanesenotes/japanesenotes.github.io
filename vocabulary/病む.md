## Mnemonics:
まさかアイツが心を病むなんてな。
* I never thought that he would get mentally ill.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sick</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be sick</span>. It can also be used as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to come down with</span> when you have the flu or some other illness.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />There is only one time you allow yourself <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be sick</span>, and that's when the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ya</span>nkees (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [や](https://jisho.org/search/や)</span>) are playing. You can't miss any games so you just happen <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to fall ill</span> whenever they're playing so you can stay home and watch. That's pretty convenient, isn't it?
