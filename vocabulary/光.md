## Mnemonics:
北朝鮮で行方不明になったあなたの子供には、まだ微かに希望の光が残っている。
* There is still a slight glimmer of hope left for your child who was lost in North Korea.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />You have a ton of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sunlight</span> where you live. This creates heat. With this sunlight heat you're able to make your favorite food in the world: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hickory</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひかり](https://jisho.org/search/ひかり)</span>) smoked bacon. Mmm, taste that delicious bacon.
