## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is the adverb version of the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> quick</span>, so it means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> quickly</span>.
* This actually uses the kun'yomi reading, but it's almost the same as the one you learned when you learned the kanji. It's just <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さっ](https://jisho.org/search/さっ)</span> instead of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さつ](https://jisho.org/search/さつ)</span>. If you can remember that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さつ](https://jisho.org/search/さつ)</span> gets shortened here, you'll know how to read this!
* 颯
* Quick
* [sound:颯と_b.mp3]
* [sound:颯と_g.mp3]
