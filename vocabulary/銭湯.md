## Mnemonics:

* 
* Give a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coin</span> and get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hot water</span>. So you hand over a coin and then you get hot water in the form of a bath. It's a bath for anyone willing to pay, making it a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> public bath</span>.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You don't know the on'yomi reading of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [湯](https://jisho.org/search/湯)</span>, though, so just think about how when you get in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> public bath</span>, you're in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> To</span>kyo (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とう](https://jisho.org/search/とう)</span>), because there are a lot of public baths in Japan, and Tokyo is the most well known city there.
* 銭, 湯
* Coin, Hot Water
