## Mnemonics:
どうして神道には絶対的な神がいないのですか。
* Why doesn’t Shinto have an absolute God?
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> way</span>/<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> road</span> of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> god</span>(s) is, as you can probably guess, a big Japanese religion. There's two, and I'll give you a hint, this one isn't Buddhism (that would probably have the kanji for Buddha in it, no?). So what's the other big one? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shinto</span>. If you're having trouble remembering this because you've never heard of it before, skip to the reading. The reading will help.
* The reading is a bit wonky. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [神](https://jisho.org/search/神)</span> should be no problem. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [道](https://jisho.org/search/道)</span> on the other hand is almost the one you learned (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [どう](https://jisho.org/search/どう)</span>) but now it's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とう](https://jisho.org/search/とう)</span> for some reason. Perhaps the gods took away the dakuten to make it <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とう](https://jisho.org/search/とう)</span>, who knows. All I know is that it's best not to question said gods. If you already know of Shinto in English, though, this reading should be really easy. If you don't, perhaps you can use this reading to help you to remember Shinto the religion.
* 神, 道
* God, Road
