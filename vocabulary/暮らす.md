## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> livelihood</span>. The verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to live</span>. It's not really to live literally, though. It's more like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to live one's life</span>, rather than just to live.
* If anyone is going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to live one's life</span>, it's gotta be the great <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ku</span>blai Khan (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [く](https://jisho.org/search/く)</span>). He conquered most of the world and was super badass.
* 暮
* Livelihood
* [sound:暮らす_b.mp3]
* [sound:暮らす_g.mp3]
