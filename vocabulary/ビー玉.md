## Mnemonics:
かれは、けっこんのあかしに一つぶのビー玉をくれた。
* He gave me a single marble as proof of our marriage.
* Presumably this <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ビー](https://jisho.org/search/ビー)</span> is short for the word bead. Beads used to be glass, which means that if you have a glass bead ball, you probably have yourself a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> marble</span>.
* If you know katakana as well as the reading that you learned when you learned the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [玉](https://jisho.org/search/玉)</span></span>, you should be able to read this. Just watch out for the rendaku.
