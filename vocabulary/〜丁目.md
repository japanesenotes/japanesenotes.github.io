* I got this peach from Tanaka of 3-chome.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> street</span> you can see with your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eye</span> isn't soooo big you can't see it (like a town would be), but it's still pretty big because it has a street. This section of the town is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> district of a town</span>, or a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> city block</span> (though specifically one of an irregular size).
* The readings are the ones you learned with the kanji, so use those and you'll be A-Okay.
