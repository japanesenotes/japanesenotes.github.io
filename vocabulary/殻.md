## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br /><span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shell</span>s come from (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> から</span>) living animals. You can't have a shell unless something was once in there. They have to come from something.
* 殻
* Husk
* [sound:殻_b.mp3]
* [sound:殻_g.mp3]
