## Mnemonics:

* 
* You don't say to aggression. When you do aggression on someone, you're probably doing something to hurt them in some way. This is an attack, making this word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to attack</span>. This refers to a planned attack, though. Think about what you're going to do. Plan it out. Then, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [攻める](https://jisho.org/search/攻める)</span>!
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: When you (I'm talking about you) attack something, you don't use weapons or thinking or anything silly like that. No, you use your intense <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> se</span>xiness (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せ](https://jisho.org/search/せ)</span>). Bam! So sexy. Attack!
* 攻
