## Mnemonics:
オレは家にいるおまえの新妻のことを考えて言ってるだけだよ。分かるか？彼女がお前の死で一生苦しむことになっても、本当にいいのか？だから、自殺なんてするなって。
* I’m just thinking about your new wife at home. Okay? Do you really want to make her suffer from your death for the rest of her life? So, don’t commit suicide.
* You learned the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [苦しい](https://jisho.org/search/苦しい)</span> (hopefully) in level 9. That word means suffering. So, if you make that into a verb version, you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to suffer</span>.
* The reading comes from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [苦しい](https://jisho.org/search/苦しい)</span>, so as long as you're on top of that word, this word should be readable for you as well.
* 苦
* Suffering
* [sound:苦しむ_b.mp3]
