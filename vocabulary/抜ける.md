* Remember how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [抜く](https://jisho.org/search/抜く)</span> means to extract or to pluck? This one is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be extracted</span>. You're not doing the extracting. Why? Because you really don't <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> care</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ける](https://jisho.org/search/ける)</span>).
* The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji. Also, it is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [抜く](https://jisho.org/search/抜く)</span>.
