## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> person</span>'s <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pattern</span> is the pattern of actions which they take to become who they are. What do they usually do? What is their pattern? This is the same as their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> personal character</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> personality</span>.
* The readings are both kun'yomi readings, combined. For <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [人](https://jisho.org/search/人)</span> you'll just have to remember this. With <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [柄](https://jisho.org/search/柄)</span> that's the reading you learned anyways, so that makes things easier. Just keep it consistent!
* 人, 柄
* Person, Pattern
