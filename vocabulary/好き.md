## Mnemonics:
そのままの君が好きなんだ。だから、他のやつのために自分を変えようなんてしないでくれよ。
* I like you just the way you are. So please don’t try to change yourself for anyone.
* You know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [好](https://jisho.org/search/好)</span> means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> like</span> and this vocab word means the same thing: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> like</span>!
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Who do you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> like</span> more than anyone? Your friend <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Sue</span>. If you know someone named Sue, pretend you like her. If you don't, think of a famous person you know named Sue and use her, pretending you're good friends that like each other a lot.
* 好
* Like
