## Mnemonics:
ぼくのつくえにえんぴつを立ててくれませんか？
* Could you please stand some pencils up on my desk?
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means stand so what's the verb version? It's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to stand</span>.<br />Don't confuse this with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [立つ](https://jisho.org/search/立つ)</span> which also means to stand. It's a different kind of to stand. With this one, you're standing something up. As in, I stood up the action figure or I will stand up the flag. You're doing the action of standing something up.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [た](https://jisho.org/search/た)</span> portion. In order to do that, think of yourself standing up a huge sign. On it, written in big words: <br /><span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ta</span> ta (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [た](https://jisho.org/search/た)</span>)!
* 立
* Stand
