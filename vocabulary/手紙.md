## Mnemonics:
私はコカコーラ宛に、心のこもった手紙を書いて、どうして彼らの製品にたくさん砂糖が入っているのかについて尋ねたいと思います。
* I’m going to write a very heated letter to Coca-Cola and ask why there is so much sugar in their products.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hand</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> paper</span> being a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> letter</span> seems kind of strange, but think of it this way: <br />Paper that you can fit in your hand? That's good for a letter. Also, you could write a letter on your hand if you want, though it would hurt a lot to chop off your hand and send it (imagine doing this).
* The reading is double kun'yomi (body parts tend to make kanji in words change to a kun'yomi reading). Both kanji in this word had you learn that reading right from the start, though, so you should be able to read this word. Just watch out for the rendaku making it <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がみ](https://jisho.org/search/がみ)</span>, not <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かみ](https://jisho.org/search/かみ)</span>.
* 手, 紙
* Hand, Paper
* [sound:手紙_b.mp3]
* [sound:手紙_g.mp3]
