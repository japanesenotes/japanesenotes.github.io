* You should <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> congratulate</span> a person who speaks lots of different <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dialect</span>s because they have to be a really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> strong person</span> to be able to do it. You think learning Japanese is hard now, just wait till you hear Osaka-ben and Hokkaido-ben. It takes a really strong person to learn all those dialects, so congratulate them and tell them how strong they are!<br />Fun Fact: <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [弁慶](https://jisho.org/search/弁慶)</span> is the name of an actual historical figure who was really strong. They were so strong, that we now use their name to refer to all strong people. Think of it like calling someone Hercules or Achilles in Western languages.
