## Mnemonics:

* 
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flower</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> powder</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> symptom</span>s are when you start sneezing from flower powder, aka pollen that comes from all sorts of flowers, which is pretty much all plants. This word, however, refers to the most common version of this sickness, which is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hay fever</span>.
* The reading is all on'yomi readings, which you learned for all but <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [花](https://jisho.org/search/花)</span>. Instead, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [花](https://jisho.org/search/花)</span> is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>, and to remember that you can think about how the only way to escape the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hay fever</span> is to jump in your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r and turn on the filter. Sweet, sweet relief.
