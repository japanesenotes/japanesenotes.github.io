## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> die out</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to die out</span>. You know that this one is to die out because you're up in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> air</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [える](https://jisho.org/search/える)</span>), looking down at the dinosaurs, who are all dying out. Thank goodness you're up in the air, because the ground is all on fire.
* The reading can come from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [絶つ](https://jisho.org/search/絶つ)</span>, so as long as you know that word you know this one as well.
* 絶
* Extinction
* [sound:絶える_b.mp3]
* [sound:絶える_g.mp3]
