## Mnemonics:
周りの目が気になるんです。
* I'm worried about what other people are thinking about me.
* This is the noun version of the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> circumference</span>, so it means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> circumference</span> too.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You really want to measure the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> circumference</span> of something but there doesn't seem to be anything round around. That's when you remember, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Mah Wa</span>lnuts! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まわ](https://jisho.org/search/まわ)</span>). The walnuts in your pocket have an easy <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> edge</span> to measure.
* 周
