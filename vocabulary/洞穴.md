## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cave</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hole</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cave</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> den</span>.
* The reading of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [洞](https://jisho.org/search/洞)</span> is one you've learned. The reading of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [穴](https://jisho.org/search/穴)</span> isn't one you've learned, though. So, think about how you go inside this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cave</span>, only to find yourself covered by some red goopy liquid. You think it's blood, but luckily it just turns out to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ketsu</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けつ](https://jisho.org/search/けつ)</span>). If you want to be less formal, you can also use the kun'yomi and say <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほらあな](https://jisho.org/search/ほらあな)</span>, but then you'd never learn that reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [穴](https://jisho.org/search/穴)</span>, and where's the fun in that?
