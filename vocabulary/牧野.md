## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pasture</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> field</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pasture land</span>. It's also a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ranch</span>.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.<br />The secondary reading is a bit different. That's a family name, and uses the kun'yomi readings of both kanji. We'll consider this secondary for now, but you may have to come back to this when you see this as a name and are all like what's going on here??
* 牧, 野
