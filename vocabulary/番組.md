* I haven’t watched anything but variety programs lately.
* Use a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> number in a series</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> group</span> the things you watch and listen to. That makes them your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> program</span>s. Your TV and radio programs, specifically. If you watch TV you'll hear it a lot!
* This word consists of the on'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [番](https://jisho.org/search/番)</span> and the kun'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [組](https://jisho.org/search/組)</span>. You've learned them both so as long as you remember the rendaku, you should be able to read this word too!
* 番, 組
* Number In A Series, Group
