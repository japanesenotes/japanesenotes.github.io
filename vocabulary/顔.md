## Mnemonics:
「おい、お前。何か文句でもあんのか？ジロジロ見てんじゃねぇぞコラ。」「えっと、あなたの顔、かなり青く見えるんですが、大丈夫ですか？」
* Hey, buddy. Are you picking a fight with me? Why are you staring at me like that? Well, your face looks really pale. Are you okay?
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* The reading is kun'yomi, since it's a kanji all alone with nothing attached. Luckily, that's also the reading you've already learned, so associate that with this vocab word.
