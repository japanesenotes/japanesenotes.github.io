## Mnemonics:
私の夢は漫画家になることです。叶うといいな。
* My dream is to become a manga artist. I hope it will come true.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You're having this crazy <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dream</span>. The dream allows you to do anything you want. Every time you ask hey, can I do this? The answer is always <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> you may</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆめ](https://jisho.org/search/ゆめ)</span>). Think of some things you'd want to do if you could do anything. Ask permission and get this answer in your imagination.
