## Mnemonics:
クソ暑いし蒸し蒸しするしたまんねぇな！この暑さでは寝られないよ。プールに行こうぜ！
* It’s too hot and humid! I can’t sleep in this heat. Let’s go to the pool!
* This is the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hot</span>... but we're going to call it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hot weather</span>. Why? Because there's a difference between something that's hot and the weather or atmosphere being hot. This is that kind of hot, as in...Damn, man, it's hot out here!
* This uses the same reading as the one you learned with the kanji, so you're good to go here!
* 暑
* Hot
* [sound:暑い_b.mp3]
* [sound:暑い_g.mp3]
