## Mnemonics:

* 
* Something that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> contrary</span>... this is the te-form version of contrary, meaning you're starting to say something, making this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> on the contrary</span>.
* The reading is like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [変える](https://jisho.org/search/変える)</span>, which is to change. So, if you change what the other person is saying to another way, then you're saying you're changing things. It has the same reading, so remember it that way.
