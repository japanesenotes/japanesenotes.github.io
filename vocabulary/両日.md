## Mnemonics:
iPadの使い方についての講義に両日とも参加したが、まだ使い方が分からない。
* I attended the iPad lecture session on both days, but I still have no clue how to use it.
* Kanji doesn't go together much better than this. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Both</span> plus <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> day</span> equals <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> both days</span>.<br />This is a bit of a formal word though, you'll hear important people say it more than your friends.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Note that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [日](https://jisho.org/search/日)</span> uses the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じつ](https://jisho.org/search/じつ)</span> for this one instead of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にち](https://jisho.org/search/にち)</span>.
* 両, 日
* Both, Sun
* [sound:両日_b.mp3]
* [sound:両日_g.mp3]
