## Mnemonics:
だれかが道端にソファを捨ててたんだけど、まだ使えそうだったから、拾ってきたよ。
* Someone threw a couch away on the side of the road, but it still looked useful, so I picked it up.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pick up</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to pick up</span>.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Nicely done!
* 拾
* Pick Up
* [sound:拾う_b.mp3]
* [sound:拾う_g.mp3]
