## Mnemonics:
ねぇ、あなたの時計に唾が着いてない？
* Hey, isn’t that spit on your watch?
* A thing that gives you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> time</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> measurement</span>s is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> watch</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clock</span>. Most people have these in their phones instead of on their wrists now.
* The reading for this is pretty weird. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [計](https://jisho.org/search/計)</span> is all nice and normal, but <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [時](https://jisho.org/search/時)</span> is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [と](https://jisho.org/search/と)</span> for some reason. It probably is coming from the vocab word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [時](https://jisho.org/search/時)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [と](https://jisho.org/search/と)き</span>), is my guess. But even if it is, it's shortened, making it a step more complicated. Maybe it's just better to imagine that your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> watch</span> is a walky <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> talky</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [と](https://jisho.org/search/と)けい</span>) and run with that?
* 時, 計
* Time, Measure
