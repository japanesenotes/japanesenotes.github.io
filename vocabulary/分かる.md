## Mnemonics:
日本ごは分かりますか？
* Do you understand Japanese?
* This is a strange meaning for this kanji. This word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to understand</span> and the kanji means many things (understand is one of the lower meanings, which is why I didn't include it in the kanji). This word will often be written in kana alone, but it's written in kanji enough that I thought you should learn it. Think about it this way: <br />You have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> separate</span> cars (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>) into different groups. Why? Because that's the only way <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to understand</span> their behaviors and culture. All the Hyundais over here... All the Toyotas over there... Now study them to understand.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />When you separate all the cars out to understand them, they get really sad. They like being together with their car friends. So, they begin crying and wailing. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> WAHHHHHH</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わ](https://jisho.org/search/わ)</span>) they cry out. WAHHH.
