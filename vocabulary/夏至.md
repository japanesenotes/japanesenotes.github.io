## Mnemonics:

* 
* If you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attain</span>ed <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> summer</span>, that must mean you finished out with the previous season and are going into summer. This is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> summer solstice</span>.
* You didn't learn the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [夏](https://jisho.org/search/夏)</span> reading with the kanji, so we'll have to come up with a mnemonic to remember the reading of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> summer solstice</span>, especially the first half. Just think about how cute little <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ge</span>ckos (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [げ](https://jisho.org/search/げ)</span>) start to come out into the open during the summer solstice. It's too cold for them to be out in the open before that, so if you look outside at the right time, you'll see geckos popping out of the ground all over the place!
* 夏, 至
* Summer, Attain
* [sound:夏至_b.mp3]
* [sound:夏至_g.mp3]
