* We’ll introduce you to hormone balance adjustment methods.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> arrange</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to arrange</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You go <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to arrange</span> a bunch of food on a table for the people of OZ. You turn around to grab the last one and hear all of the plates start crashing to the ground. You turn around and yell, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Toto no</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ととの](https://jisho.org/search/ととの)</span>)! Your dog Toto jumped on the table and is knocking everything over. Now you'll have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to prepare</span> everything all over again. Dammit Toto.
