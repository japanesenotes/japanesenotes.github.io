## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rice paddy</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> field</span>. You'd think this would refer only to a rice field, but it actually refers to other types of fields too, making this word simply <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> field</span>. I guess that shows how important rice is, because if a field isn't growing rice, it ain't no field o' mine.
* The readings come from what you learned with the kanji. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [畑](https://jisho.org/search/畑)</span> uses the shorter <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はた](https://jisho.org/search/はた)</span> reading that you learned.
