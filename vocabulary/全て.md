## Mnemonics:
僕が先だよ。ウィキペディアが僕の宿題を全て真似したんだ。
* I was the first to do it. Wikipedia copied my entire homework assignment afterwards.
* This has a little hiragana attached to it but nothing that suggests it's a verb or an adjective. That means you can assume this word has the same meaning as its parent kanji.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すべ](https://jisho.org/search/すべ)</span> part, which is an admittedly difficult sound to remember. You have to think of the concept of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> all</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> entire</span>. When you think of that concept, think of someone's entire fortune. All their money. You want to get all of Beth's money, so you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue be</span>th (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すべ](https://jisho.org/search/すべ)</span>) for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> all</span> she has.
