## Mnemonics:
今一ばん大切なのはあたまの毛だ。
* Right now the most important thing to me is the hair on my head.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />Look down! You're wearing something covered in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fur</span>. It's a fur <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ke</span>vlar (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [け](https://jisho.org/search/け)</span>) vest! All kevlar is just really tightly woven fur. Didn't you know?
