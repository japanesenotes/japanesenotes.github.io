## Mnemonics:
らい月の八日にじの手じゅつをするよていです。
* I’m going to get hemorrhoid surgery on the eighth of next month.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Eighth day</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> day eight</span>. No matter how you look at this word, it makes a lot of sense.
* Words that count days use an exceptional reading. Even though this is a jukugo word, it uses kun'yomi readings for both the kanji. Think about this word this way:<br />Every <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eight days</span> you have to buy <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>gurt to fuel your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ようか](https://jisho.org/search/ようか)</span>). Your car runs on yogurt, but it needs to be refilled every eight days to keep running. It's really inconvenient because it's just ONE day more than a week. And a week just feels better. Oh well.
* 八, 日
* Eight, Sun
* [sound:八日_b.mp3]
* [sound:八日_g.mp3]
