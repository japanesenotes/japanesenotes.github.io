## Mnemonics:
ずっと座っていると、お尻が汗ばんできます。
* When I’m sitting for a long time my butt gets sweaty.
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sit</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to sit</span>.
* The reading is unlike the kanji reading, so let's use a separate mnemonic to remember this. Just imagine yourself going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to sit</span> down. You sit down, and the ground collapses below you and you fall. When you land, you find yourself in a nasty, stinking <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sewer</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すわ](https://jisho.org/search/すわ)</span>). It is so gross. Taste the sewage in your mouth. Smell it. Feel gross. You shouldn't have sat down on that spot, it was looking awfully dangerous, now that you think about it.
* 座
* Sit
* [sound:座る_b.mp3]
* [sound:座る_g.mp3]
