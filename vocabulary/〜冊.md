## Mnemonics:
すみません、ちょっとお声が遠いようなのですが。日本語の教科書が何冊いるとおっしゃいましたか？
* Excuse me, I’m having trouble hearing you. Did you say how many Japanese textbooks you want?
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* The reading is the same as well. It's probably treated like on'yomi jukugo because it's attached to things (like numbers!).
* 冊
* Book Counter
* [sound:〜冊_b.mp3]
