## Mnemonics:
みんなの会話に混ざることができなくてとても悲しかったし、寂しかったよ。
* I felt really sad and lonely because I couldn’t contribute to the conversation at all.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mix</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to get mixed</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be mixed</span>. This is when something is just getting mixed and you're not directly doing the action of mixing anything. You can remember this because the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Tzar</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ざる](https://jisho.org/search/ざる)</span>) of Russia is very impressed that things mix on their own and you're not doing the mixing.<br />The connotation for this word is you can't distinguish the things you're mixing, like combining paints, which become one mixed color that isn't two separate colors anymore.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: If you're not doing the mixing, in order for things <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to get mixed</span> you call your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ma</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ま](https://jisho.org/search/ま)</span>) up and ask her to mix it. What a terrible lazy child you are.
* 混
* Mix
* [sound:混ざる_b.mp3]
* [sound:混ざる_g.mp3]
