## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />It turns out she is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fake</span>. Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> niece</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にせ](https://jisho.org/search/にせ)</span>) was a robot this whole time, just pretending to be your niece. What is wrong with this world, where your niece can be an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> imitation</span> niece. A <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [偽](https://jisho.org/search/偽)</span>niece, if you will.
