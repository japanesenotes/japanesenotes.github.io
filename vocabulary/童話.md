## Mnemonics:
宮沢賢治の童話「祭の晩」は、私が子供の頃大好きなお話でした。
* Miyazawa Kenji’s fairy tale Night of the Festival was my favorite story when I was a child.
* Don't think of this as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> juvenile</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> talk</span>. Think of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [話](https://jisho.org/search/話)</span> the vocab word, which means story. If you do that, you get a juvenile story. What's a juvenile story? It's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> children's story</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 童, 話
* Juvenile, Talk
