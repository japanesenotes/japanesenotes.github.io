## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gather</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to gather</span>.
* When you gather things, you go around and take things from their original location to put them together in your gathering spot. In Japanese, when you take something, you could say <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [取る](https://jisho.org/search/取る)</span>, right? This word has the same reading: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> とる</span>.
* 採
* Gather
