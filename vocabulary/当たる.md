## Mnemonics:
自分の予想が当たって、嬉しいです。
* I’m glad my guess was right.
* You know this is a verb because it ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound. The kanji for this word is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> right</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> success</span>, so what's the verb form of that? Turns out it's a ton of things. Like, a crazy amount of things. I tried narrowing it down for you, but it will still be a lot. This word tends to be about getting an answer right. As in, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to guess correctly</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be on target</span>. It means many other things too, but I think these are the two meanings you'll see the most, so focus on those.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あ](https://jisho.org/search/あ)</span> portion. <br />You need to guess the correct answer. What do you choose? You guess <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> A</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あ](https://jisho.org/search/あ)</span>) and hope it's right. Turns out you were right on the money. Well done! Imagine yourself winning a fabulous prize.
