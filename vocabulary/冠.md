## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* This word is a bit of an exception and it even has three different, totally acceptable readings. (Sorry, I swear I didn't make this up.) So here's a mnemonic to help you remember them:<br />The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> traditional cap</span>s can have three different styles. A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> can</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>) shape, a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> came</span>l <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ri</span>b shape (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かむり](https://jisho.org/search/かむり)</span>), or a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> can</span>ned <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 'muri</span>ca (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)むり</span>) shape (it's a bald eagle in a can). Can you picture them all in your head? You only need to choose one at least! Yay!
