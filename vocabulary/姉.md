## Mnemonics:
姉はスチュワーデスをしています。
* My big sister works as a stewardess.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This is your older sister, by the way. Not somebody else's.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet,  so here's a mnemonic to help you remember:<br />Picture your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> older sister</span> (even if you don't have one), her birthday is coming up and there's only one thing she wants from you. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> A ne</span>cklace (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あね](https://jisho.org/search/あね)</span>). She's wanted a necklace for years and you're finally going to give her one. She'll be so happy.
* 姉
