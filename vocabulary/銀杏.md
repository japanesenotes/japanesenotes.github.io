## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Silver</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> apricot</span>s are called <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ginkgo nut</span>s. Okay, they aren't really apricots, but they are silver and they sure <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginkgo_biloba#/media/File:Ginkgo_Seed.JPG>look the same</a>.
* This word is an exception. You'd think it would be the same in Japanese as it is in English, but it's not. And it has two different readings and meanings. Yikes, sorry. Here's a mnemonic to help you out:<br />Before you read this PLEASE PLEASE REMEMBER this is NOT a jukugo word. It's weird. You're gonna want to type <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎんこう]([ぎん](https://jisho.org/search/ぎん)こう)</span> but that's wrong. Stop that now.<br />When you think of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ginkgo tree</span> think about this: Ginkgos are a favorite nesting place for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gles but evil Mrs. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chou</span> likes to eat eagles AND whole gingko trees. She prefers eating eagles WHILE THEY'RE IN THE GINKGO TREES AND ARE STILL ALIVE. So <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いちょう](https://jisho.org/search/いちょう)</span>. Eagles and Mrs. Chou. And gingko trees. It's horrible to think about. Just like this reading not being jukugo.<br />The other meaning is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ginkgo nut</span>s themselves. They taste like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 銀</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎん](https://jisho.org/search/ぎん)</span>) <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> naan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なん](https://jisho.org/search/なん)</span>). Mm mm soft and metallic, but still not the jukugo word though. How sad for you and all Japanese learners everywhere.
* 銀, 杏
* Silver, Apricot
