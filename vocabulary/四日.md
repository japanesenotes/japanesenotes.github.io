## Mnemonics:
あのくまに出あって四日ご、ぼくのせなかにかびがはえた。
* Four days after I met that bear, my back started growing mold.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Fourth day</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> day four</span>. No matter how you look at this combination of kanji, the meaning of the word makes a lot of sense!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Counting days, however, is an exception (at least up to ten). You need to use the kun'yomi readings to read this word. You already know the kun'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [四](https://jisho.org/search/四)</span>, so that's fine (the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ん](https://jisho.org/search/ん)</span> gets turned into a small <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [っ](https://jisho.org/search/っ)</span>, though). Think of it this way:<br />On the fourth day you pour <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>gurt (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よっ](https://jisho.org/search/よっ)</span>) all over your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>) because on the fifth day you're going to have to eat (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いつ](https://jisho.org/search/いつ)</span>) it. (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [五](https://jisho.org/search/五)</span>'s kun'yomi reading is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いつ](https://jisho.org/search/いつ)</span>).
* 四, 日
* Four, Sun
* [sound:四日_b.mp3]
* [sound:四日_g.mp3]
