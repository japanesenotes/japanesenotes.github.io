## Mnemonics:
「誰かが車から荷物を降ろさないといけないんだけど…。」 「わかったから、それ以上言わなくていいよ。」
* Someone ought to unpack the luggage from the car… Alright. Say no more.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> luggage</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thing</span> is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> luggage</span>. It's also your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> baggage</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> load</span> too.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You'll need to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [物](https://jisho.org/search/物)</span> reading as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もつ](https://jisho.org/search/もつ)</span>, though. Why? Because all your luggage just got thrown into various <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> moats</span> along the countryside. It's going to take you forever to collect your luggage from these moats and by then it'll be all soggy. Dangit...
* 荷, 物
* Luggage, Thing
