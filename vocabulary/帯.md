## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Just keep in mind that this is the type of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> belt</span> you use for kimono and yukata (traditional Japanese clothes) and not the kind you use to hold up your blue jeans.
* What is the first letter in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> belt</span>? Hmm, I can't remember. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> OH! B</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おび](https://jisho.org/search/おび)</span>)! I remember now.
