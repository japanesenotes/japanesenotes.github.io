## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> look for</span> and the verb version of the kanji is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to look for</span>.
* You are looking for a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sagger</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さが](https://jisho.org/search/さが)</span>) amongst the products you're shipping off overseas. The saggers are the boxes that have weird lumps sagging out of them, which means they broke and are getting things wet. So, find the saggers. Go <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to search for</span> them, because they could ruin the whole shipment.
* 探
* Look For
