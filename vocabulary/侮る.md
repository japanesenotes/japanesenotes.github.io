## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> despise</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to despise</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Think of all the things you start <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to despise</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to disdain</span>. Now come up with some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> anecdo</span>tes (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あなど](https://jisho.org/search/あなど)</span>) for each one of those things. Be sure to think in your head, I'm coming up with anecdotes for things I disdain, why am I coming up with anecdotes?
