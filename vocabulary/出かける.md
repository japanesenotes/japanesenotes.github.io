## Mnemonics:
日曜日は家族で海に出かけるの。
* I’m going out to the beach with my family on Sunday.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exit</span> but you do it with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かける](https://jisho.org/search/かける)</span> added to it. Just think of that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かける](https://jisho.org/search/かける)</span> as you exiting while being cocky about it. You do this when you want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to go out</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to leave</span>. You go out in a cocky way!<br />This word can only be used for a person going out. You can't say a train <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [出かける](https://jisho.org/search/出かける)</span>'d.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading when you learned <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [出る](https://jisho.org/search/出る)</span>, so if you can remember that, you should be able to remember this one too!
* 出
* Exit
* [sound:出かける_b.mp3]
* [sound:出かける_g.mp3]
