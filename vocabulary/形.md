## Mnemonics:
ねえ、私の、お尻の形をしたお腹、撫でたい？
* Hey, do you want to rub my butt-shaped belly?
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You really want to eat food that's in neat <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shape</span>s, so you decide to use a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cutter</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かた](https://jisho.org/search/かた)</span>) on your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chee</span>se (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ち](https://jisho.org/search/ち)</span>) to make it a new shape. Square cheese is so boring. After you cut it up you have mouse shaped cheese! It just tastes better like that.
