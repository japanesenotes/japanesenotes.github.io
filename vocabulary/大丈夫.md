* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> big</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> height</span> of your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> husband</span> makes everything <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> safe</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> all right</span>. Nothing you need to worry about when you have your super giant husband around to protect you. This is a really useful word, and it is used all the time. If someone asks: Are you alright? you could say in response <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [大丈夫](https://jisho.org/search/大丈夫)</span> to mean you're doing all right.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. Watch out for the rendaku.
