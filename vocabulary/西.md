## Mnemonics:
その頃、西ポートランドでは、鰐蟹がその道を渡っていた。
* Meanwhile in West Portland, the Crabigator was crossing the road.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />You go off to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> west</span>. It's the Wild West, even. There aren't many people out here, making it easy to find a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> niche</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にし](https://jisho.org/search/にし)</span>) for your snake oil business.
