## Mnemonics:

* 
* An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> imitation</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> manner</span> is something that does something in the manner of something else. Imitation over and over and over. Make it into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pattern</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since you didn't learn the on'yomi for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [様](https://jisho.org/search/様)</span> with the kanji, here's a mnemonic to help you out. You see a pattern in your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>gurt (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よう](https://jisho.org/search/よう)</span>). The yogurt is an imitation of life. So deep, man. So deep.
