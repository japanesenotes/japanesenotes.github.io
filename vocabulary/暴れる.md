## Mnemonics:
ビエトは酔って暴れたが、コウイチがなんとか落ち着かせた。
* Viet got drunk and disorderly, but Koichi managed to calm him down.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> violence</span>. To violence doesn't sound great, so instead this word is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to act violently</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to rage</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You're about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to rage</span> all over the place. You're going nuts. You're going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to act violently</span>. Then, a calm wizard steps in front of you and mutters <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> aba</span>ra kadabara, (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あば](https://jisho.org/search/あば)</span>) causing you to calm down immediately.
