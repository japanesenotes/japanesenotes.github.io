## Mnemonics:
ボールをバットに上手く当てたと言いたかったんだけど、間違えてお尻に当てたと言ってしまった。
* I wanted to say, I hit the ball really well with my bat, but I accidentally said butt.
* You know that the kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [当](https://jisho.org/search/当)</span> means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> right</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> success</span>. So since this is a verb, you're doing right and success (which doesn't make much sense). Instead, you're guessing something and getting it right. So, this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to guess</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to guess something</span>. Hopefully you don't have to guess too hard when it comes to the meaning of this word as well.
* The reading can be remembered via the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [当](https://jisho.org/search/当)たる</span> which you learned a few levels ago. Use that knowledge to remember that this word is read as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あてる]([あ](https://jisho.org/search/あ)てる)</span>. The important part is the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あ](https://jisho.org/search/あ)</span>.
* 当
* Correct
* [sound:当てる_b.mp3]
* [sound:当てる_g.mp3]
