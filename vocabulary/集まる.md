## Mnemonics:
見て！あそこにヤンキーたちがたくさん集まってるよ。
* Look! A group of miscreants are gathering over there!
* I bet you remember <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [集める](https://jisho.org/search/集める)</span> which means to collect. This is similar to that, except you're not doing the action of collecting, it's just happening. Instead of to collect it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to come together</span>. You can remember this because a herd of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Maru</span>s (the cat) will come together into one place if they sense a box there.
* The reading is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [集める](https://jisho.org/search/集める)</span> so if you know that word you'll know how to read this word as well.
* 集
* Collect
