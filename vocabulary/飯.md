## Mnemonics:
あそこの飯は本当に臭かったぜ。二度と塀の中には戻りたくねえな。
* Those were some really stinky-smelling meals! I never want to go back to prison.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. It also refers to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cooked rice</span>, because you gotta eat cooked rice with every meal, so it's basically synonymous with meal itself.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You're eating a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> meal</span>... MMmm, delicious! What are you eating? Well, it's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Mesh</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [めし](https://jisho.org/search/めし)</span>) net. Taste the mesh net. It tastes terrible. This is a bad meal. Feel it in your mouth. It's weird and meshy.
