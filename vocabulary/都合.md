## Mnemonics:
「土曜日と日曜日、どちらの方が都合がいい？」「どちらでもいいよ。」
* Which day is convenient for you, Saturday or Sunday? It makes no difference to me.
* This one makes no sense (sorry!). When you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> join</span> together with someone at a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> metropolis</span>, you do it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> at your convenience</span>. You're important, after all, so you just do what you want and make the other person wait in this giant metropolis while you move along leisurely. Imagine this, and keep thinking at your convenience as you walk about.<br />This word is usually used in a nicer way, though. As in, do it at your convenience!
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [都](https://jisho.org/search/都)</span> is an exception from what you learned with the kanji. To remember this, just think about someone who does something at their own convenience. They say, I'm going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to go</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つごう](https://jisho.org/search/つごう)</span>) where I want, when I want, at my own convenience.<br />The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [合](https://jisho.org/search/合)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ごう)]([ごう](https://jisho.org/search/ごう)))</span> part is a reading you know from the kanji, though, so if you can get to to go with the mnemonic, you should be able to put two and two together to know that it's a long vowel <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ごう](https://jisho.org/search/ごう)</span>.
* 都, 合
* Metropolis, Suit
* [sound:都合_b.mp3]
* [sound:都合_g.mp3]
