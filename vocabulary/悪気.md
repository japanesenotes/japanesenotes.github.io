ところで、そもそも、何の経験もなくて、どうやってその職を得たの？あ、悪気は無いよ。
* By the way, how did you get the job without any experience in the first place? No offense, of course.
* Someone with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bad</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> energy</span> is someone who has <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> evil intent</span>. Hopefully you don't have too much <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [悪気]([悪](https://jisho.org/search/悪)気)</span>.
* The reading itself has a lot of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [悪気]([悪](https://jisho.org/search/悪)気)</span> with all the exceptions it has. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [悪](https://jisho.org/search/悪)</span> part is read like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [悪](https://jisho.org/search/悪)い</span>. Then, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [気](https://jisho.org/search/気)</span> is rendaku'd. What an evil reading. Just think what's the most evil reading I can come up with? when you see this word. Then you should hopefully be able to read it.
* 悪, 気
* Bad, Energy
* [sound:悪気_b.mp3]
* [sound:悪気_g.mp3]
