* If you put <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> writing</span> into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> category</span>, you'd have to write it down after you've chosen what category it is in. Where would you write that down? Into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> document</span>, probably.
