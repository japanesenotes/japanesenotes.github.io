You have to dig deep into your energy, all the way to the origin and source of it, to have enough <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> patience</span> to deal with this dumb kid who's eating away at your not-root energy. It's all you have, and you need to use it.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
