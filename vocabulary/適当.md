## Mnemonics:

* 
* Everything is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suitable</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> right</span>. Therefore it is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> appropriate</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> proper</span>. Strangely enough, this also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> irresponsible</span>. Maybe it's because when everything is suitable and right for you, you're taking too much and not leaving enough for everyone else, making you irresponsible?
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 適, 当
* Suitable, Correct
