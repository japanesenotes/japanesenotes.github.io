## Mnemonics:

* 
* With the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [日](https://jisho.org/search/日)</span> of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [日](https://jisho.org/search/日)本</span>, the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [日](https://jisho.org/search/日)</span> means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Japan</span>. Then, you add <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Korea</span> into the mix and you have Japan + Korea. This word means Japan and South Korea or South Korea and Japan (depending on where you're from, I guess).
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
