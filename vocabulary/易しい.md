## Mnemonics:
試験の時、易しい問題から先に解いてしまう方が好きなんです。
* During exams, I like solving the easy questions first.
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> easy</span>? It's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> easy</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Everything is so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> easy</span> for you to do. Why? Because you don't do anything yourself. You ask others. You say things like Hey, can you get me some water? They say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yassah!</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [やさ](https://jisho.org/search/やさ)</span>) very enthusiastically.
