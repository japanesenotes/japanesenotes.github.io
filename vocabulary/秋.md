## Mnemonics:
はぁ？まだこの秋に一回ご飯食べに行っただけなの？あんた頭イッちゃってるんじゃないの？どう考えても彼氏って呼ぶのはおかしいでしょ。それは付き合ってるとは言えないと思うよ。
* What? You’ve only gone out to dinner with him once so far this fall? Have you lost your mind? Don’t you think it’s strange to think about calling him your boyfriend? I don’t think you can say you’re dating him.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> あき</span>.
