* My section manager is kind of annoying. He is always trying to impress the other workers.
* Remember how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [社長](https://jisho.org/search/社長)</span> is the company president? This uses the same <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [長](https://jisho.org/search/長)</span> meaning (where it means something like boss). Since <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [課](https://jisho.org/search/課)</span> means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> section</span>, this is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> section manager</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 課, 長
