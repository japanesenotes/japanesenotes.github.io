## Mnemonics:
フグを海に放すといつも、泳いで逃げちゃって、私が呼んでも知らんぷりするの。どうすれば逃げないように教えることができるのかしら。
* Every time I let Fugu loose in the sea, he swims off and when I call him he doesn’t listen. What should I do to teach him to not run away?
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> release</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to release</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Imagine you are going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to release</span> something. It is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 花</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はな](https://jisho.org/search/はな)</span>). You release it from your hand and it falls, hitting the ground in slow motion. You have the power to release and you are doing the releasing (versus <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [放れる](https://jisho.org/search/放れる)</span> where something is just released). You can remember this because even though you did the releasing of the flower, you're going to sue the pavement company for breaking your flower. It's all a big scam you're running.
