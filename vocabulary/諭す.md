## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> admonish</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to admonish</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to warn</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Your mom started <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to admonish</span> you so you instantly <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sat</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さと](https://jisho.org/search/さと)</span>) down. Maybe if she sees you sat down right in front of her, looking guilty and feeling remorseful, she won't yell as hard.
