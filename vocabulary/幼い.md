## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> infancy</span>. The adjective version refers more to your entire child-times, including baby times. But, if you're described as being like a child from child times, what are you called? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Childish</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: When you were <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> childish</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> immature</span> you were sent off to do prayers to ask for forgiveness. One of the things you had to do was sing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hosanna</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おさな](https://jisho.org/search/おさな)</span>) in the highest.
* 幼
