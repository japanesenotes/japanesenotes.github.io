## Mnemonics:
今日は一日中外であくびをしていた。
* I kept yawning outside all day today.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />You look outside, it's totally frozen. You throw <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> salt</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そと](https://jisho.org/search/そと)</span>) outside to melt the ice.
* 外
* Outside
* [sound:外_b.mp3]
* [sound:外_g.mp3]
