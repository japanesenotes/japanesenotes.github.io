## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> immersed</span>. Things that are immersed are described by verbs like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be soaked in</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be submerged</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be flooded</span>.
* What is soaked and submerged in water (that shouldn't be)? It is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> heater</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひた](https://jisho.org/search/ひた)</span>). It's all soaked and doesn't work anymore :(
* 浸
* Immersed
