## Mnemonics:

* 
* Something that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wither</span>s from <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thirst</span> ends up <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> drying up</span>. If you let a plant <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dry up</span> like this it might die if you don't water it soon.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [渇](https://jisho.org/search/渇)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />If all of your plants are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> drying up</span> you should just give them to your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cats</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かつ](https://jisho.org/search/かつ)</span>). Cats love to play with dried up plants. At least they won't go to waste.
* 枯, 渇
* Wither, Thirst
* [sound:枯渇_b.mp3]
