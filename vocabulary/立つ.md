あそこに立っているのが、あなたのみらいの子どもです。
* The person standing over there is your future child.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means stand so what is the verb version of that? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to stand</span>.
* You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [た](https://jisho.org/search/た)</span> portion of this word to learn the reading of it. Think of it this way: <br />You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to stand</span> up in order to wave goodbye to someone. When you stand up, you also say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ta</span> ta (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [た](https://jisho.org/search/た)</span>)!
