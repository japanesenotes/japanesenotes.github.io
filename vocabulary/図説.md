もし解説と共に図説があれば、より分かりやすくなるかと思うんですが、如何でしょうか？
* I think it would be easier to understand if there was an illustration with an explanation, what do you think?
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> diagram</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> theory</span> is an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> illustration</span> that is used as an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> explanatory diagram</span>. Just imagine a chalk board with all sorts of drawings of things, showing how they work, at least in theory.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 図, 説
* Diagram, Theory
