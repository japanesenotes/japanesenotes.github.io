## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> line up</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be lined up</span>. You know this is the version where things are just lined up (you're not doing the lining up) because you keep saying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶ](https://jisho.org/search/ぶ)</span>), why is everyone already lined up? I should have got here earlier so I don't have to wait (if you were doing the lining up yourself, you'd put yourself in the front, duh).
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Only for you, when you visit <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Nara</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なら](https://jisho.org/search/なら)</span>), the deer there are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be lined up</span> for you to inspect, as you are the deer inspector. If you don't know about Nara and its deer, you should look it up, they're pretty awesome.
