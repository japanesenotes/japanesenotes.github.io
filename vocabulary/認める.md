## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> recognize</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to recognize</span>.
* The reason I was able <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to recognize</span> you is because your face was covered in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> meat</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みと](https://jisho.org/search/みと)</span>). Your face was always covered in meat all those years ago too!
* 認
* Recognize
