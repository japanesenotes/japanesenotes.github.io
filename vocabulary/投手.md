## Mnemonics:
今日の先発投手は誰になると思いますか？
* Who do you think today's starting pitcher will be?
* The person who <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> throw</span>s with their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hand</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pitcher</span> in a baseball game. Other games don't involve throwing with your hand, they've got kicking with feet. So when you picture a hand throwing, picture your favorite pitcher!
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [手](https://jisho.org/search/手)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />To be a good <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pitcher</span>, all you have to do is put the ball into the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chute</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅ](https://jisho.org/search/しゅ)</span>). Pitchers don't actually throw the ball. There is an invisible pitching chute right on the mound. You slide the ball into the chute and off it goes!
* 投, 手
* Throw, Hand
* [sound:投手_b.mp3]
* [sound:投手_g.mp3]
