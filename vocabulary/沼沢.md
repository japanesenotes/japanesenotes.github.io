## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bog</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> swamp</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> swamp</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> marsh</span>.
* Oddly, this is the one word that uses the on'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. To remember this particular <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> swamp</span>, note how there are two kanji in here that make this area particularly swampy. Because it's the swampiest, boggiest place in all of Japan, of course the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Sho</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>) wants it for himself. Even though it's useless land, he wants the best of everything, being the Shogun and all.
* 沼, 沢
