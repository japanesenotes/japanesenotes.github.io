* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> degree</span> of your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spirit</span> is what helps you to hone your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> precision</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accuracy</span>, for some reason. Just imagine yourself throwing a ball. You miss the target. Hmm, okay... time to power up like on Dragonball. Up that spirit energy. Turn the degrees up on it. Boom. Awesome. Now throw again. Hit! You hit it! What great <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> precision</span> you have gained by honing your spirit!
