## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> excel</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to excel</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> He-e</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひい](https://jisho.org/search/ひい)</span>) is going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to excel</span>, you stutter. He-e is!
* 秀
* Excel
* [sound:秀でる_b.mp3]
* [sound:秀でる_g.mp3]
