## Mnemonics:
なぜだか、体中がかゆいんだ。
* My entire body is so itchy for some reason.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />You have your body. It's nice - looking good! What would really mess up your body? It would be a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> car raider</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [からだ](https://jisho.org/search/からだ)</span>). I'm talking about a dude who is a raider of some kind driving a car. If he runs into your body, you're done for, so watch out for the car raider. <br />Of course, this mnemonic is only meant to get you close to the reading. Hopefully it is close enough to get you to the actual reading, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [からだ](https://jisho.org/search/からだ)</span>.
