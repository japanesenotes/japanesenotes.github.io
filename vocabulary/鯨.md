## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> whale</span> is actually gojira's (godzilla) cool cousin <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kujira</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くじら](https://jisho.org/search/くじら)</span>). Godzilla mutated from a whale, so they're still related. That's where he gets his name from!
* 鯨
* Whale
* [sound:鯨_b.mp3]
* [sound:鯨_g.mp3]
