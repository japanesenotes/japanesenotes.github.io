## Mnemonics:

* 
* Remember how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [縫う](https://jisho.org/search/縫う)</span> means to sew. Well the only way you can see if a pair of jeans has been sewed with your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eye</span> is if you see a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seam</span>. If your eyes can't spot the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stitch</span>es, then it probably wasn't sewed at all. Maybe it was superglued together.
* This is a combination of the words <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [縫う](https://jisho.org/search/縫う)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [目](https://jisho.org/search/目)</span>. Both use the kun'yomi readings so just change the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> and it's easy! You'll also see this word spelled <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [縫い目](https://jisho.org/search/縫い目)</span> too. They're exactly the same!
* 縫, 目
* Sew, Eye
