## Mnemonics:
ねぇ、新しい野球の球を買ったんだけど、一緒にキャッチボールしない？
* Hey, I got a new baseball. Do you want to play catch with me?
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Another meaning I'm going to add is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sports ball</span> because this is the word used for balls in various sports (soccer, baseball, etc).
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You're holding onto a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sports ball</span> in your hand, let's say it's a baseball for this mnemonic's sake. You throw it at your friend who's going to catch it. As it flies through the air, though, it transforms into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> toma</span>hawk (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たま](https://jisho.org/search/たま)</span>). Imagine your shock and fear as you see this happening, flying towards your friend! It's going to stick in his forehead. He can't catch this with his glove! <br />Also notice that it has the same reading as the vocab word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [玉](https://jisho.org/search/玉)</span>. So, if you know that one, you may know this one too! They're kind of similar.<br />This can be read <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きゅう](https://jisho.org/search/きゅう)</span> too, if you're talking about more of a globe sphere than the ball sphere you throw.
