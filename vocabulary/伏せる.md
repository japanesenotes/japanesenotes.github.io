## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bow</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lay</span>, so the verb version is what when you try <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to cover</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to hide</span> something. You're doing the action to something, you're not the one hiding.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Who's that you're trying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to cover</span> up? It's your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foo</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>) brother. He keeps doing embarrassing things and trying to get you in trouble. So you're trying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to hide</span> him with your jacket. Well we see him, we know he's a fool, so you can stop now.
