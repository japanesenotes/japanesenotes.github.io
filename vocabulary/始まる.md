## Mnemonics:
銃声が、大食いパイコンテストの始まりの合図となります。
* The sound of the rifle means the pie eating contest has started.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb.<br />This is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. Something starts. No direct object here. That's why this verb means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to start</span>.
* Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading.<br />Lucky for you, the kanji readings for transitive and intransitive verbs are almost always the same. Once you learn one, you know them both! This reading is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [始める](https://jisho.org/search/始める)</span>.
* 始
* Begin
* [sound:始まる_b.mp3]
