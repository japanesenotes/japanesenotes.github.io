## Mnemonics:

* 
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> look up to</span> someone... twice. That's too many times that you're looking up to someone. They must be pretty amazing for that to happen. Really, though, you're being fooled. This person is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pompous</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exaggerated</span>. So you think they're cool, but really they're pretending to be more than they are.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, x2 with a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しい](https://jisho.org/search/しい)</span> added on for good measure.
* 仰, 々
* Look Up To, Repeater
