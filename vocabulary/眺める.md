## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stare</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to stare at</span> (or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to look at</span> in a very staringish way).
* To learn the reading, just think about how you're looking at something for a lonnnnng time if you're staring at it. In Japanese the word long is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [長い](https://jisho.org/search/長い)</span>, and guess what the reading of the kanji part is? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> なが</span>, just like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ながめる](https://jisho.org/search/ながめる)</span>'s kanji-part reading.
* 眺
* Stare
