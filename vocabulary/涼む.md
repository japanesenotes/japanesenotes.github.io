## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cool</span> (temperature-wise) and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to cool oneself</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to cool off</span>. Whoo, that feels much cooler now.
* You use a special product in a can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to cool off</span> with. It's an experimental product that was made by the zoo you're at (because this zoo is really warm, and it's nice to cool down). You use it, and it burns your face off. So, you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue</span> the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> zoo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すず](https://jisho.org/search/すず)</span>) for the face burning.
