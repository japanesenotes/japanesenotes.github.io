## Mnemonics:
明日の午後、大好きな俳優に会えるんです！
* I get to meet my favorite actor tomorrow afternoon.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> meet</span> so the verb form of that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to meet</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to encounter</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あ](https://jisho.org/search/あ)</span> part but let's include the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> as well for this one. Who do you want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to meet</span> more than anyone? Think about it. Then, imagine meeting them. The first thing they do is grab your arm and pinch it. You yell out <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> OW</span>! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あ](https://jisho.org/search/あ)う</span>) and they laugh and run away.
* 会
