## Mnemonics:
ようかいの目玉のようなぶどうだとおもう。
* I think these grapes look like monster eyeballs.
* What is an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eye</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ball</span>? Oh wait, that's easy. It's an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eyeball</span>!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [目玉](https://jisho.org/search/目玉)</span></span>, however, is an exception. Perhaps this is because it includes a body part (the eye) in it, which often makes a word switch to kun'yomi readings. Either way, it doesn't matter too much. Both the readings you learned for the kanji in this word are the kun'yomi, meaning you should know how to read this one. Just make sure you watch out for the rendaku.
* 目, 玉
* Eye, Ball
* [sound:目玉_b.mp3]
* [sound:目玉_g.mp3]
