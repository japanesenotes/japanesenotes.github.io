## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji means strangle and this vocab is the verb version of that: to strangle.<br />There is another word, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [絞る](https://jisho.org/search/絞る)</span> which means to wring out that looks very similar. You know that this one is to strangle because it has <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [める](https://jisho.org/search/める)</span> sticking out of it. Imagine that in the mail <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [める](https://jisho.org/search/める)</span> you get a letter that says I'm going to strangle you! When you get this in the mail, you know it's about strangling.
* The thing that is threatening to strangle you is actually a sheep (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>)! The sheep comes to your house and says, here's the sheep mail! and then tries to strangle you. It puts its hard feet on your neck though it's pretty ineffective.
