## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Append</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attach</span> this document to your email. It's an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attachment</span>.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [添](https://jisho.org/search/添)</span> is what you'd expect. The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [付](https://jisho.org/search/付)</span> is the on'yomi reading, which you've never learned. It's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>, but for this word it becomes <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぷ](https://jisho.org/search/ぷ)</span> from the rendaku fairies. Just think of an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attachment</span> where instead of a document or something, you get an attachment of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> poo</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぷ](https://jisho.org/search/ぷ)</span>). What a gross attachment. Your friend who likes to send poop attachments is dumb.
