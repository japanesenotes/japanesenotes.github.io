## Mnemonics:
私がこの行動の責任はすべて取ります。本当にごめんなさい。
* I take full responsibility for my actions. I am truly sorry.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> take</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to take something</span>.
* Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You're the kind of person who likes <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to take</span> things. What things? you ask. Little <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> toe</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [と](https://jisho.org/search/と)</span>). Because that isn't creepy.
* 取
* Take
* [sound:取る_b.mp3]
* [sound:取る_g.mp3]
