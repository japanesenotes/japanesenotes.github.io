## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> extreme</span>. The verb vocab version isn't to extreme because that wouldn't make sense. Instead, you carry it to extremes, making this word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to carry to extremes</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: When you go <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to carry to extremes</span>, you're going too far, so there has to be a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key wo</span>rd (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きわ](https://jisho.org/search/きわ)</span>) that you say to make the other person stop. CACAO! CACAO!
