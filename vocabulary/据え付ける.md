* This is a combination of the words <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [据える](https://jisho.org/search/据える)</span>, meaning to install, and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [付ける](https://jisho.org/search/付ける)</span>, meaning to attach. Put them together and you're still going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to install</span> something or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to equip</span> something. There's just more hands on work happening.
