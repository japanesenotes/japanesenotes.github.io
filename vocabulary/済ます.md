## Mnemonics:

* 
* Remember <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [済む](https://jisho.org/search/済む)</span> and how it means to come to an end. This is like that, but slightly different. This is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to finish</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to settle</span>, because this is when you're doing the coming to an end action. You can remember this because you're coming in to finish the score uno <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mas</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ます](https://jisho.org/search/ます)</span>) time. This is the last time.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [済む](https://jisho.org/search/済む)</span>, so if you know that you'll be able <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to finish</span> this vocab.
* 済
* Come To An End
* [sound:済ます_b.mp3]
* [sound:済ます_g.mp3]
