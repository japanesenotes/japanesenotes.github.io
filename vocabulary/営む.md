## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> manage</span>, but when you manage something, what are you usually managing? How about a business? So this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to run a business</span> even though the kanji is manage.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to run a business</span>. Your business is to make people eat who don't want to eat. HEY, YOU <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> EAT NO</span>W! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いとな](https://jisho.org/search/いとな)</span>).
* 営
* Manage
