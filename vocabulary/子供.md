## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> child</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> servant</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> child</span>. Children are basically like little servants anyways, what else are they good for?
* The readings for this one are the kun'yomi readings of each kanji. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span> is just <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span>, like the individual vocab word. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [供](https://jisho.org/search/供)</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ども</span>, however. Remember this by thinking how much <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> children</span> love <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> domo</span>-kun.<br />Also, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)ども</span> is kind of more politically correct with the kana hanging off there. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)供</span> is still used in a lot of situations, usually stiff ones. The second kanji means servant, and some people don't like that. It's still used quite a bit though, but the second version pops up a decent amount, so it's good to be familiar with that as well.
