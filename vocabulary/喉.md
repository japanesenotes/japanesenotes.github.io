## Mnemonics:
喉が痛いので、私の代わりに歌ってくれませんか？
* I have a sore throat. Can you sing on my behalf?
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji (and is a body part) it uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />Remember the mnemonic from when you first learned this kanji? Well <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> is still in your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> throat</span> and he doesn't want to get out. In fact, every time you tug on him, he shouts, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> No Do</span>- (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [のど](https://jisho.org/search/のど)</span>) but you gag and can't hear the rest. People around you think you're saying No Do- but it's really just the weirdo living in your throat now. What a pain...
