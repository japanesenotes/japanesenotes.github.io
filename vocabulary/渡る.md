## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> transit</span>, but when you think about to transit this doesn't make too much sense. When you transit something, though, you're going across it. That's why this word is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to cross</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to cross over</span>.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
* 渡
* Transit
* [sound:渡る_b.mp3]
* [sound:渡る_g.mp3]
