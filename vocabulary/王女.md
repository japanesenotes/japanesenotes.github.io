## Mnemonics:
王女さまはよろこびをバクてんでひょうげんしているようです。
* The princess expresses her joy by doing backward somersaults.
* The king woman is the princess. How do you tell this word apart from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [女王]([女](https://jisho.org/search/女)王)</span>, which means queen? Well, the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [女](https://jisho.org/search/女)</span> part comes before the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [王](https://jisho.org/search/王)</span> when it's a queen, because the queen always comes before the princess (they're usually pretty selfish in the stories, right?). As for the princess, the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [女](https://jisho.org/search/女)</span> comes after the king, because she doesn't have as much power. That's why this one is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> princess</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 王, 女
* King, Woman
* [sound:王女_b.mp3]
