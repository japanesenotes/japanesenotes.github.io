## Mnemonics:
あそこで確かに何かが光るのを見たんだ。
* I’m sure I saw something shining over there.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sunlight</span>, so the verb is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to shine</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to glitter</span>. Just imagine what happens when sunlight hits things!
* Remember how you learned the reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [光](https://jisho.org/search/光)</span>? Well this is almost the same thing. Just change the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [り](https://jisho.org/search/り)</span> to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span> and you'll know this reading!
