## Mnemonics:
ビエトは、コウイチのパソコンの向こうから立ち上っている煙を見て驚きました。何故なら、オフィスは禁煙だったからです。
* Viet was surprised to see smoke rising from the other side of Koichi’s computer because smoking is banned in the office.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You're standing around a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> smoke</span> machine. It's billowing up smoke. Strangely, your buddy Bill Murray is here too. For some reason, he loves the smoke, and he puts his head in it, breathing it in deeply until he goes into a coughing fit. You decide it's time to stop him. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kay, Murray</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けむり](https://jisho.org/search/けむり)</span>), it's time to stop that, you say.
