## Mnemonics:
ちょっと僕の手を見て、それが縮んでいるかどうか教えてくれませんか？
* Can you please look at my hand and tell me if it is shrinking?
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> see</span> so the vocab here means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to see</span>.
* The reading for this word is the same as the reading you learned with the kanji (kun'yomi) so you should be able to read this.
* 見
* See
* [sound:見る_b.mp3]
* [sound:見る_g.mp3]
