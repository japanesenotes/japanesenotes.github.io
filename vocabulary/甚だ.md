## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />If you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> very</span> tired and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> very</span> giggly, you'll try to say your friend's name but start laughing right away so it ends up sounds like,  <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Hannah ha</span> ha ha (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はなは](https://jisho.org/search/はなは)</span>).
* 甚
* Very
* [sound:甚だ_b.mp3]
* [sound:甚だ_g.mp3]
