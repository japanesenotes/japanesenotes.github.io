## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> valuable</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> formal name title</span>. It's like saying something like the valuable great you... or something. Anyways, this means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> you</span>, but it isn't as nice as it sounds. Probably a lot of irony and sarcasm going into this word, because if you use <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きさま](https://jisho.org/search/きさま)</span> to say you to someone, you're probably not pleased with that person, or you're just trying to be rude.
* The readings are the reading you learned with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [貴](https://jisho.org/search/貴)</span> plus the vocab reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [様](https://jisho.org/search/様)</span>.
* 貴, 様
* Valuable, Formal Name Title
* [sound:貴様_b.mp3]
