## Mnemonics:
人せいには五つのくるしみがあるが、その一つはへんずつうである。
* There are five hardships in life and one of them is migraines.
* From previous number+<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span> words, you can probably guess that this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> five things</span>.
* The reading of this word is the kun'yomi reading of the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [五](https://jisho.org/search/五)</span></span>, meaning you didn't learn it when you learned the parent kanji reading. To remember this word, think of it this way:<br />You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> five things</span>. What do you have to do with them? You need to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eat</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いつ](https://jisho.org/search/いつ)</span>) them. If you come up with something crazy you have to eat, and focus on the fact that you must eat five of these things, it will help a lot too.
* 五
* Five
