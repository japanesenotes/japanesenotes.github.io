## Mnemonics:
博多弁で喋る女性はとても可愛いと思います。
* I think women who speak with a Hakata accent are really cute.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [〜](https://jisho.org/search/〜)</span> is there to show this attaches onto things, like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [東京弁](https://jisho.org/search/東京弁)</span>, meaning Tokyo Dialect.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Because it's normally attached to other words it uses the on'yomi reading like a jukugo word normally would.
* 弁
* Dialect
* [sound:〜弁_b.mp3]
* [sound:〜弁_g.mp3]
