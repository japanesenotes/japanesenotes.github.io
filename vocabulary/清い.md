## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pure</span>? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pure</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: In order to stay <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pure</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clean</span>, you shouldn't ever do anything dirty or bad. That is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key, yo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きよ](https://jisho.org/search/きよ)</span>).
