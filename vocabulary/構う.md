## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> care</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to care about</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Do you care a lot about grammar? I don't care, unless it has to do with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> comma</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かま](https://jisho.org/search/かま)</span>). Then I do flip out.
