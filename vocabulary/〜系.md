## Mnemonics:

* 
* When you associate with a certain <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lineage</span>, you trace yourself back with a group of people. This group of people is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tribe</span>, your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lineage</span>, your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> group</span>.
* The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji, probably because this word gets stuck onto other things to describe tribes and groups.
* 系
* Lineage
