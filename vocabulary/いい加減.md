ねえ、お父さん。お母さんさぁ、近所の井戸端会議で仕入れたいい加減な情報に踊らされるの、いい加減に止めるべきだと思わない？
* Hey, Dad. Don’t you think it’s time for mom to stop being manipulated by pointless gossip from idly chatting with the neighbors?
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> add</span> and you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> subtract</span>. This brings you back to zero. There was absolutely no point in doing those actions. Completely <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pointless</span>. In fact, I'd say that was downright <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> irresponsible</span> of you. The extra <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いい](https://jisho.org/search/いい)</span> is there to mean good, as in good, you've figured out how pointless that was, now stop.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 加, 減
* Add, Decrease
