## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: You make a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fist</span>. Why? Because she stole your corn on the cob. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Cob! She</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こぶし](https://jisho.org/search/こぶし)</span>) stole my cob!
