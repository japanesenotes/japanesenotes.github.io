## Mnemonics:

* 
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tall</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rapids</span> are the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shallows</span>. I have no idea how this makes sense, but I suppose if the water is taller, it's not going to have as much rapids going on, meaning it's just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shallows</span> (but not too tall to become something else, like a lake, or whatever).
* The reading comes from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [高い](https://jisho.org/search/高い)</span> and the reading you learned for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [瀬](https://jisho.org/search/瀬)</span>.
* 高, 瀬
* Tall, Rapids
