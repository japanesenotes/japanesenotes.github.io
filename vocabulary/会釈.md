## Mnemonics:

* 
* Before you can give an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> explanation</span> of who you are to someone you're about to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> meet</span>, you have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nod</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bow</span> as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> greeting</span> first. It's rude to start explaining who you are before you greet them.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [会](https://jisho.org/search/会)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />When someone <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bow</span>s to you, you always feel a little uncomfortable, so you say, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Eh</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [え](https://jisho.org/search/え)</span>) and try to get them to stop. You're so uncomfortable that you can't think of words and eh is all you can manage to get out.
