## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fire</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wound</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> burn</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scald</span> you got from fire (or other hot things). Ouch!
* The reading for this is unlike anything you've seen with these kanji. Try to think about a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> burn</span> (on your arm) being caused by a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yakky do</span>do (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [やけど](https://jisho.org/search/やけど)</span>) bird (which is a dodo bird that has yak-like features). Take a look at how weird it is, and wonder why it is burning you. Feel the pains.
* 火, 傷
* Fire, Wound
* [sound:火傷_b.mp3]
* [sound:火傷_g.mp3]
