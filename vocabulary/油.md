## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* You need to apply <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> oil</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a bra</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あぶら](https://jisho.org/search/あぶら)</span>) because it's stuck on you. You can't get it unhooked, so you have to slide it off. Problem is, it's too tight, which is why <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a bra</span> needs oil to slide off.
