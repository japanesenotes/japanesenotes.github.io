## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />What goes in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gutter</span>? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 水</span>. But, the reading isn't exactly right. It's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みぞ](https://jisho.org/search/みぞ)</span> not <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みず](https://jisho.org/search/みず)</span>, but close enough to create a hook.
