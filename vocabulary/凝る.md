## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> congeal</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> freeze</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to grow stiff</span>. But it's also used to mean what happens when your emotions or interests freeze on one thing. You start <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be absorbed in</span> whatever that thing is. Try to remember both meanings.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />What have all your friends started <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be absorbed in</span>? Their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 子</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span>). They all keep having kids and now that's all they seem to care about. Damn kids.
