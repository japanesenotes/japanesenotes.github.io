## Mnemonics:
要るものと要らないものをリストに書き出しなさい。
* Write out a list of things you do and don’t need.
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> need</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to need</span>.
* Since the reading isn't like the one you learned, think about what you are going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to need</span>... like, what you're really going to need, more than anything. Then, think of an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gle, because you really need an eagle. You'll need to come up with the reason why you need an eagle though, so hopefully it's a good one.
* 要
* Need
* [sound:要る_b.mp3]
* [sound:要る_g.mp3]
