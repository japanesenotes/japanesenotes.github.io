## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accomplish</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to accomplish</span>.
* Everything you've accomplished can put stored in your single little pinky <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> toe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [と](https://jisho.org/search/と)</span>)... you haven't accomplished that much, apparently.
