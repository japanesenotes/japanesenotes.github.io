## Mnemonics:

* 
* If <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [漏れる](https://jisho.org/search/漏れる)</span> is to leak, then this is when you do the leaking yourself. The reason this thing is leaking, though (and it shouldn't be), is because you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rush</span>ed (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [らす](https://jisho.org/search/らす)</span>) the job (because you did it yourself), which is why you know this is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to leak something</span>.
* The reading comes from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [漏れる](https://jisho.org/search/漏れる)</span>, so if you know that, you know this! Don't let that memory leak from your head.
* 漏
* Leak
