## Mnemonics:

* 
* What's the city of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flat</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soil</span>? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Pyongyang</span> in North Korea. Which is pretty misleading, it's got more than a bunch of flat dirt, but back in the old days before the illustrious Kim Jong line built it up, that's all that was there.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. It can also be pronounced the way we say it in English sometimes too. That's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ピョンヤン](https://jisho.org/search/ピョンヤン)</span>, if you're wondering, and these kanji are used for it too.
* 平, 壌
* Flat, Soil
* [sound:平壌_b.mp3]
* [sound:平壌_g.mp3]
