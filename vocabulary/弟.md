## Mnemonics:
弟がビリヤードのボールを頭に投げつけてきたので、昨夜僕は病院に行くはめになった。
* I ended up going to the hospital last night because my younger brother threw a pool ball at my head.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />You look at your younger brother. He's a scheming one. He's smiling up at you. Why? Because he's lit a firecracker on your foot. It explodes, sending your toe flying. You yell OH. Toe? TOE! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おとうと](https://jisho.org/search/おとうと)</span>) as you realize what's going on.
* 弟
* Younger Brother
* [sound:弟_b.mp3]
* [sound:弟_g.mp3]
