トーフグの目標について、もう少し具体的に話をして頂けませんか？
* Could you be a little more specific about Tofugu’s goals, please?
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> signpost</span> you have your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eye</span> on is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> goal</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> target</span>. Just imagine looking at this signpost in the distance. You know you have to get to it from where you are. That is the goal of your hike and journey.
* You've had the on'yomi reading of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [目](https://jisho.org/search/目)</span> with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [目](https://jisho.org/search/目)次</span> way back in level 6. For this vocab, you're trying to get to your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> goal</span>, that signpost in the distance. As you're trekking towards it there are people standing to the side <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mock</span>ing you, telling you you'll never make it to your goal. Imagine this happening.
* 目, 標
* Eye, Signpost
