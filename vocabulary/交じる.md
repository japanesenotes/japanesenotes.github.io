## Mnemonics:
わたしのさいふをすった後、そのスリはす早く人ごみに交じってきえました。
* After snatching my wallet, the pickpocket quickly blended in with the crowd and disappeared.
* You know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [交ぜる](https://jisho.org/search/交ぜる)</span> means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to mix</span> and that the kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mix</span> as well. So, this probably has something to do with mixing things. This word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be mixed</span>. This is when something is mixed but it's not mixed by you. It's just being mixed. Think of it this way - the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span> in <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [交じる](https://jisho.org/search/交じる)</span> is Jesus, who just uses Jesus magic to mix something. So, you're not mixing it. It's just when something is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be mixed</span>.
* The reading is the same as with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [交ぜる](https://jisho.org/search/交ぜる)</span>. So long as you know the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ま](https://jisho.org/search/ま)</span> portion of that word's reading, you'll be able to read this word as well.
* 交
* Mix
