## Mnemonics:
その熱が彼の体力を弱めたが、まだ自分で水を飲む体力は残っていた。
* The fever weakened his body, but he was still strong enough to drink water by himself.
* You have your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> body</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> power</span>. This is just another way to say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> physical strength</span>. Watch out, if you use too much of your physical strength you may run out of physical <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stamina</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> endurance</span> completely! They're tied together, so make sure to pace yourself.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 体, 力
* Body, Power
