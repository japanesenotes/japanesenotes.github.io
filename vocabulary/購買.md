## Mnemonics:

* 
* If you create <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> subscription</span>s to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> buy</span> things, you're probably in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> purchasing</span> department. It's your responsibility to set up subscriptions and buy everything for everyone else because you're the purchasing person.
* The reading is on'yomi, which is great for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [購](https://jisho.org/search/購)</span> but not as great for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [買](https://jisho.org/search/買)</span>. Luckily, the reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [買](https://jisho.org/search/買)</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> buy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばい](https://jisho.org/search/ばい)</span>), which is the same as the meaning, which is a pretty awesome coincidence.
* 購, 買
* Subscription, Buy
