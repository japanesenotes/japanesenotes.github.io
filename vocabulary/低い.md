* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> low</span>? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> low</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.
