## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Sweep</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exclude</span> all that dirt from the floor, please. When you do this a lot, it becomes <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cleaning</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. For this one though, you have to remember to read the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [除](https://jisho.org/search/除)</span> part as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span>. Just keep in mind that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cleaning</span> (cleanliness) is next to godliness and so is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Je</span>sus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span>). So, Jesus is like cleaning. Easy.
