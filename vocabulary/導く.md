## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lead</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to lead</span>.
* The reading for this one is a bit difficult, but there's a hint in the kanji. See the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [道](https://jisho.org/search/道)</span> in there on the top? What's the reading for the vocab version of that kanji? It's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みち](https://jisho.org/search/みち)</span>. That's the first part. Now, who are you leading? Let's say you're leading a bee back to its nest, via the road. It's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 道 Bee</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みち](https://jisho.org/search/みち)び</span>)!
