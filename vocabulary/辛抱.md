## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spicy</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hug</span> is a hug that feels not so great. But, it's not really painful all at once, either. As you're receiving a spicy hug, you just have to show <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> patience</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> endurance</span> while it lasts.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn the reading of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [抱](https://jisho.org/search/抱)</span>'s on'yomi reading, so think about how much patience and endurance you need to learn how to be good at <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bo</span>wling (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼう](https://jisho.org/search/ぼう)</span>).
* 辛, 抱
* Spicy, Hug
* [sound:辛抱_b.mp3]
