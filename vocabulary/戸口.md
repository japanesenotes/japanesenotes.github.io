## Mnemonics:
戸口に三枚のトーストがあった。
* There were three pieces of toast in my doorway.
* Do you remember the words <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [出口](https://jisho.org/search/出口)</span> (exit) and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [入り口](https://jisho.org/search/入り口)</span> (entrance) from previous levels? The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [口](https://jisho.org/search/口)</span> can be a doorway of some kind. This word is literally door mouth but I bet you can figure out that this actually means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> doorway</span>.
* The reading for this one is mixed. You get the kun'yomi readings for both kanji, even though it's a combo (jukugo) kanji. Since <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [戸](https://jisho.org/search/戸)</span>'s only reading is the kun'yomi reading you should know it. Also, you should know the kun'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [口](https://jisho.org/search/口)</span> as well from level 1. That means as long as you remember that this is a kun'yomi fest over here, you should be able to read this word. Also watch out for the rendaku (also known as sequential voicing). That just means the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [く](https://jisho.org/search/く)</span> becomes the voiced <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぐ](https://jisho.org/search/ぐ)</span>.
* 戸, 口
* Door, Mouth
* [sound:戸口_b.mp3]
* [sound:戸口_g.mp3]
