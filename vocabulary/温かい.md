## Mnemonics:
「デザートに温かいアイスクリームはいかがですか？」 「いいえ、もう結構です。」
* Would you like some warm ice cream for dessert? No, we’re all set.
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> warm</span>? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> warm</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Touch something that's warm... too warm! You pull your hand back and go <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> AH ta ta!</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あたた](https://jisho.org/search/あたた)</span>). People make this noise when they touch something that's hot, I hear. It's almost like saying hot hot hot while dropping the h sound.
