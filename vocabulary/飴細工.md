## Mnemonics:
その金魚の飴細工は、形も味も本物の金魚にそっくりなんだって。
* Apparently, the sugar goldfish is similar to real goldfish in shape and taste.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Candy</span> made into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thin</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> construction</span>s are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sugar sculptures</span>. Usually these are in the form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sugar animals</span>, but they can be anything, really.
* This word uses the kun'yomi reading for the first kanji and the on'yomi readings for the second two. You haven't learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [工](https://jisho.org/search/工)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You want your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sugar sculptures</span> to be made into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coo</span>kies (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [く](https://jisho.org/search/く)</span>)! Cookies are your other favorite snack, so having a cookie that's really just entirely made of sugar is the absolute best.<br />Also, watch out for the rendaku on <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [細](https://jisho.org/search/細)</span>, it's easy to miss if you're focusing on remembering this new on'yomi reading.
* 飴, 細, 工
* Candy, Thin, Construction
