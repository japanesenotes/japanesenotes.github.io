## Mnemonics:

* 
* When <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> barbarian</span>s <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sit</span> they only <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sit cross legged</span>. Sitting on your feet hurts and they don't care how they look, so they're going to be comfortable and cross their legs.
* The reading for this word is an exception. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember it:<br />If you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sitting cross legged</span> lots of people will think you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a gro</span>uch (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あぐら](https://jisho.org/search/あぐら)</span>). Back in the day sitting like this was thought to be really manly, and if you were a woman who did it they'd call you a grouch too.
* 胡, 座
* Barbarian, Sit
* [sound:胡座_b.mp3]
* [sound:胡座_g.mp3]
