## Mnemonics:

* 
* Look <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> below</span> you. These things carry your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> burdensome</span> weight. All of it. These are the shoes you wear, though in this case they are specifically <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> geta</span>, or Japanese wooden clogs. The clogs themselves are kind of burdensome and hard to wear too, actually, so you can think of it that way as well.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [駄](https://jisho.org/search/駄)</span> is the secondary kanji reading. Instead of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だ](https://jisho.org/search/だ)</span> it's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [た](https://jisho.org/search/た)</span>. Hopefully you've heard of geta before. This will make it really easy for you to remember the reading of this vocab word.
* 下, 駄
* Below, Burdensome
* [sound:下駄_b.mp3]
