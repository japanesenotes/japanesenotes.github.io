## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.<br />This word also has a few more meanings: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> instep</span> (the top part of the arch in your foot) and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> back of the hand</span>. These are parts of you that kinda look like turtle shells in shape, don't you think?
* This word is made up of a single kanji, but it uses the on'yomi reading, not the kun'yomi reading. Luckily, you've learned this reading already. Yay!
