満州事変について説明をしてもらえますか？
* Can you explain what the Manchurian Incident is?
* An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> action</span> that takes place that could <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> change</span> the locale or even the world has got to be a big <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> incident</span>. You'll sometimes see this on the ends of incident names, like the Manshuu Jihen (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [満州事変](https://jisho.org/search/満州事変)</span>), aka the Manshuu Incident. You know that it isn't an unusual or strange incident (like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [変事]([変](https://jisho.org/search/変)事)</span>) because the strange kanji (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [変](https://jisho.org/search/変)</span>) doesn't come first with this word. Instead, it comes after and means change in this case.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 事, 変
* Action, Change
* [sound:事変_b.mp3]
* [sound:事変_g.mp3]
