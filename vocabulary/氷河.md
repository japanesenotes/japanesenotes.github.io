## Mnemonics:

* 
* An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ice</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> river</span> is some ice that moves (very slowly) like a river. That is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> glacier</span>. In fact, many inlets and sounds were created with glaciers, because glaciers moved through them like rivers... not very quickly, though.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [氷](https://jisho.org/search/氷)</span> is the one you didn't learn. Think of the glacier coming slowly to your door. It rings your doorbell and says <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> heyo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひょう](https://jisho.org/search/ひょう)</span>).
