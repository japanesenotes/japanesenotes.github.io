* 
* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [並ぶ](https://jisho.org/search/並ぶ)</span> is when something is lining up. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [並べる](https://jisho.org/search/並べる)</span> is when you're lining something up. You know this because when it comes to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bear</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [べる](https://jisho.org/search/べる)</span>), you have to line them up yourself, because they won't be doing it for you, that's for sure.
* The reading can come from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [並ぶ](https://jisho.org/search/並ぶ)</span>, so if you know that you can figure out the reading for this one as well.
