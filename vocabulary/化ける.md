## Mnemonics:
私の家はリフォームの後で全く違う家に化けてしまったので、息子は学校が終わった後にどの家に帰るのか分からなくなってしまいました。
* My house was so completely transformed after the renovation that my son didn't know which home to go to after school.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> change</span> so you'd think the verb version is to change but it's a little different. This word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to transform</span>, which is a lot like to change but this is more like when a person transforms into something else, like a dinosaur.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You try to transform. You want to turn into something awesome, like a dinosaur, but then *poof* you turn into a sheep. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ba</span>aaa, you say. Baaa.
* 化
* Change
* [sound:化ける_b.mp3]
* [sound:化ける_g.mp3]
