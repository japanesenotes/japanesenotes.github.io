## Mnemonics:
一等に当選したことを知った時、宝くじを持つ手の震えが止まらなかった。
* When I realized I won the grand prize, the hand I was holding the lottery ticket with couldn’t help but shake.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hold</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to hold</span>. This word is for when you're carrying or holding something, simply.
* If you try <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to hold</span> something in your hand long enough it will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mo</span>ld (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [も](https://jisho.org/search/も)</span>). And then that mold will cover your hand, then your arm, then your entire body. Basically, you should never hold anything for too long or you'll become a mold person.
* 持
* Hold
