## Mnemonics:
ピザを半分に分けるなら、大きい方を下さい。
* If you split the pizza, could you give me the bigger half?
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> (in this case <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span>) sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> separate</span> (at least, that's one of its several meanings). So, the verb form of that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to separate</span>. <br />You'll have to differentiate this word with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [分かる](https://jisho.org/search/分かる)</span> which is very similar but has a totally different meaning. You'll need to learn the reading to do this, but think of it this way: You must separate your Wake (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わけ]([わ](https://jisho.org/search/わ)け)</span>) time from your sleeping time.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to separate</span> a couple of children that really have fun together. When you separate them, they begin to cry and scream: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> WAAAAAAAAAHHHH</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わ](https://jisho.org/search/わ)</span>). Poor kids.
