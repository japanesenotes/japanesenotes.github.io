* Similar Fugu patterns can be seen on local earthenware made between 50 B.C. and 20 A.D.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> origin</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> after</span> the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> narrative</span>. What narrative was this? It's THE narrative, to many. This is the narrative of Jesus. This was so important that they decided to start a new era after it, making this era <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> after death</span>* or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> AD</span>.<br />*Yes, I know it's not actually After Death but it's so commonly misconceived as such that I put it in there as the definition. You understand the meaning still, right? Anno Domini is also available as a definition too, so don't fret!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
