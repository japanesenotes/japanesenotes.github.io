## Mnemonics:
昨夜、Tofuguのオフィスに放火する夢を見たんだけど、焼け跡の灰には、大量の魚の骨があったよ。
* Last night, I dreamt that I was burning the Tofugu office. In the ashes of the ruins, I saw a mountain of fish bones.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: Take a look at your own <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bone</span>s. They have been upgraded with special technology, allowing you to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hone</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほね](https://jisho.org/search/ほね)</span>) in on targets, then shoot your bones at them. Go ahead and imagine yourself using this crazy new bone technology. Wolverine is jealous.
