* Could I check your ID?
* You hopefully know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [証明](https://jisho.org/search/証明)</span> means proof. So, when the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> proof</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> written</span> down, what kind of proof is it? It's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> certificate</span> of some kind. I'm going to need to see some <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [証明](https://jisho.org/search/証明)書</span> if you want to get in here, sir.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Knowing <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [証明](https://jisho.org/search/証明)</span>'s reading will also be helpful.
