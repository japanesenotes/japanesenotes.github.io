## Mnemonics:
Tofuguは、初音ミクの独占取材を報じた。
* Tofugu covered an exclusive interview with Hatsune Miku.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> news report</span> so you could try to say to news report but that doesn't make sense. What does make sense is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to report on</span>, however.
* The reading doesn't seem like it's the kanji's on'yomi reading, but it is. What an oddity! Do you think it's worth doing a news report on it? Koichi, reporting in on this strange reading that is readable by you right now. Signing off.
* 報
* News
