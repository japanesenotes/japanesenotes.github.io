月曜日、熱々のロマンスとか、ゾッとするホラーみたいな感じの楽しい映画をあなたと一緒に観たいなって思うんだけど、どうかな？
* On Monday, I would like to watch some fun movies with you, like a steamy romance or blood-curdling horror film. How does that sound?
* This is a day of the week. You know this because it has <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [曜日](https://jisho.org/search/曜日)</span> in it. But what day of the week is it? The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> moon</span> day of the week is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> monday</span>. Why? Because Moon is pretty much just Mon, right?
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will help to know the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [曜日](https://jisho.org/search/曜日)</span> as well.
