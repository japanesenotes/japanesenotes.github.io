## Mnemonics:

* 
* Whoops, this one comes out weird. You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> anti</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> respond</span> though the meaning of this word is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a response</span>. Maybe you're anti respond but you have no choice, you have to give <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a response</span> despite that fact?
* The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [反](https://jisho.org/search/反)</span> reading is all good and merry, but the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [応](https://jisho.org/search/応)</span> reading gets a bit wonky, turning into <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [のう](https://jisho.org/search/のう)</span>. This is probably because it's just way easier to say than <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はんおう](https://jisho.org/search/はんおう)</span> and sounds basically the same too. So, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はんおう](https://jisho.org/search/はんおう)</span> goes to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はんのう](https://jisho.org/search/はんのう)</span> and everyone's happy. Do you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a response</span>? <br />The reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はんおう](https://jisho.org/search/はんおう)</span> is also going to be included since it's technically correct though a less common spelling.
* 反, 応
* Anti, Respond
