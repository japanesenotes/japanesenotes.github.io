## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> surpass</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to surpass</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to exceed</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: In order <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to surpass</span> your rivals you will have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span>) them. You're bad at this sort of thing, so you have to cheat.
