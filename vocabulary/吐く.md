## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> throw up</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to throw up</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to puke</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to barf</span>.
* The reading is from the reading you learned with the kanji. HA HA HA! Barf.
* 吐
* Throw Up
* [sound:吐く_b.mp3]
* [sound:吐く_g.mp3]
