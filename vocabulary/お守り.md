## Mnemonics:
たくさんのお守りを同時に付けない方がいいですよ。逆に不幸をもたらすかもしれないですからね。
* You shouldn’t wear multiple lucky amulets at the same time. It could bring you bad luck instead.
* You know how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [守る](https://jisho.org/search/守る)</span> is to protect, right? This is like that, but it's the noun version. It's not really a protection, though it kind of is. What things can you wear to protect you from things like bad luck, demons, and ancient aliens? That would be a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> charm</span> or an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> amulet</span>. You'll see these kinds of things sold at temples and such.
* The reading is like that of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [守る](https://jisho.org/search/守る)</span>, so if you know the reading of that word you should be able to read this one as well.
* 守
* Protect
