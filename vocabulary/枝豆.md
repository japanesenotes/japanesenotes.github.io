* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> branch</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bean</span> doesn't mean a whole lot this way, but you probably know the food that this describes anyways. This is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> edamame</span>, a food made from <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> steamed soybeans</span>, usually with a bit of salt added for flavor.
* The readings are the kun'yomi readings of the two kanji, unfortunately. That's the vocab words <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [枝](https://jisho.org/search/枝)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [豆](https://jisho.org/search/豆)</span> combined into one.
