## Mnemonics:
お待たせしてすみません。いや〜バスにえらく長いこと待たされましてね。
* Sorry for making you wait so long. I had to wait for the bus for such a long time.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wait</span> so this word has something to do with waiting. Use the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たせ](https://jisho.org/search/たせ)</span> as a hint. Someone tossed a ball off into a ditch, and then they had to find it. They made you wait for them to get the ball too, even though it's a cheap piece of crap. Feel upset about this.
* You learned this reading from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [待つ](https://jisho.org/search/待つ)</span>, congrats!
* 待
* Wait
* [sound:待たせる_b.mp3]
* [sound:待たせる_g.mp3]
