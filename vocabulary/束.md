## Mnemonics:
どうしてもコピー用紙がいるんだけど、この花束とそのコピー用紙一束を交換してもらえないかな？
* I have to get some copy paper. Could you exchange a bundle of copy paper for this bouquet of flowers?
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You are counting your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bundle</span>s. There are a lot of them, so you have to create <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tab</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たば](https://jisho.org/search/たば)</span>) in your notebook to properly categorize everything. Imagine yourself doing this (physically creating the tabs in your notebook, even though your notebook didn't come with tabs).
* 束
