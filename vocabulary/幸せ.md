## Mnemonics:
「私はお金で幸せは買えると思います。何故なら、私は花火を見ていると幸せな気持ちになるからです。もし私が大金持ちだったら、毎日花火を楽しんでずっと幸せな気持ちでいられることができます。」彼女は幸せそうな口調でそう言った。
* I think money can buy happiness because watching fireworks makes me happy. If I had a lot of money, I could enjoy fireworks every day and feel happy all the time, she said happily.
* This is the noun version of the kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [幸](https://jisho.org/search/幸)</span>. Kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> happiness</span> and the vocab word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> happiness</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You're seeking true <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> happiness</span>. You visit a great guru who's said to help people find their happiness, but she keeps hitting you on the head while you try to talk to her. You end up with the special happiness chant, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> She Ow! Say</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しあわせ](https://jisho.org/search/しあわせ)</span>) I should say this. You can never get it out without saying ow, but you're pretty sure happiness is coming.
* 幸
* Happiness
