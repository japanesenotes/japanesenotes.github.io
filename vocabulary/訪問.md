* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> visit</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> problem</span> is when someone makes <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a visit</span>, because you're the type of person who doesn't like visitors, since they're usually so inconsiderate and you have to feed them. That's why <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a visit</span> is a visit problem.
