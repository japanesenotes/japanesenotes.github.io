## Mnemonics:

* 
* This may look like an adjective, but it's actually the noun version of the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> watered</span>. Watered things, like plants, hold a lot of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> moisture</span> in them.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You already learned this reading when you learned <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [潤う](https://jisho.org/search/潤う)</span>, so you should know this one too.
* 潤
