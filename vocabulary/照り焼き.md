## Mnemonics:

* 
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> illuminate</span> and then <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bake</span> some food. To illuminate it, you put on some shiny sauce. Then, you cook it. Sound familiar, in terms of a type of food? This is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> teriyaki</span>, though I have to warn you it's quite different from what you get at teriyaki shops in the west.
* The reading comes from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [照れる](https://jisho.org/search/照れる)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [焼く](https://jisho.org/search/焼く)</span>. Put them together and you have something delicious.
* 照, 焼
* Illuminate, Bake
