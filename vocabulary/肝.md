## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Though, it also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chutzpah</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> courage</span> (besides just being <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> liver</span>). Maybe your liver is where your courage is.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> liver</span> isn't doing great. You have cancer in your liver, so now they're giving you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chemo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きも](https://jisho.org/search/きも)</span>) to help get rid of that cancer.
