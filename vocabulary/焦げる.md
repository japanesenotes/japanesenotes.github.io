## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> char</span>, but the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be burned</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to get burned</span>. You're not doing the burning, of course, but you're getting burned (owch!).
* The times where you were burned were mostly when you were a kid (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 子</span>). That's because kids aren't good at working with hot things.
* 焦
* Char
* [sound:焦げる_b.mp3]
