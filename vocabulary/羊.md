## Mnemonics:
毛を刈られた時、羊も恥ずかしい思いをしていると思う？
* Do you think sheep feel embarrassed when they have their wool sheared off?
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />Imagine a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sheep</span> fighting with Jesus. The first thing it does is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hits Je</span>sus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひつじ](https://jisho.org/search/ひつじ)</span>) in the stomach with its fists, then hits Jesus again with its horns. Try to imagine this playing out, with an announcer calling the shots as well.
* 羊
* Sheep
* [sound:羊_b.mp3]
