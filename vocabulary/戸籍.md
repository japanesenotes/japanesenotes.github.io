## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Enroll</span> your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> door</span>... and by door, I mean enroll your family, because each family has one door to their house. Enrolling your family means you are enrolling them into the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> family register</span>. This is actually an interesting topic. Look up koseki in Google and you're sure to find many fascinating histories.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [戸](https://jisho.org/search/戸)</span> is an exception. Instead of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [と](https://jisho.org/search/と)</span> it's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span>. Just think about how the person who runs this census doesn't care about number of toes. They care about number of children (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こ</span>).
* 戸, 籍
* Door, Enroll
