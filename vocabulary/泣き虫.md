## Mnemonics:
娘の高熱が中々下がりません。普段は泣き虫なんですが、今は泣く元気も無いようで、心配です。
* My daughter's high fever doesn't seem to be coming down. She is usually a crybaby, but it seems like she doesn't even have energy to cry now and I'm worried.
* You've seen that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [泣く](https://jisho.org/search/泣く)</span> is to cry, so you can probably guess that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [泣き](https://jisho.org/search/泣き)</span> is just cry. You've also seen how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [虫](https://jisho.org/search/虫)</span> is rarely a nice thing to call someone. So what's a mean thing you can call someone who cries? How about a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crybaby</span>?
* The readings come from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [泣く](https://jisho.org/search/泣く)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [虫](https://jisho.org/search/虫)</span>. So long as you're okay with those two words you should be able to read this one too.
* 泣, 虫
* Cry, Insect
