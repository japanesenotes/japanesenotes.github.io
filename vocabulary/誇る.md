* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pride</span> and the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be proud of</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to boast of</span>.
* The hoe <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほこ](https://jisho.org/search/ほこ)</span>) is the kid who is carrying around a hoe all the time, swinging it around, doing dumb things with it. He's so proud of it, though, and it shows on his face. He's always boasting about his hoe skillz too.
