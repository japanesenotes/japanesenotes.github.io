## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> number</span> of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pearls</span>, put together on a string. This refers to a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rosary</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prayer beads</span>. You'll see these a lot in Japan, for sale or with monks wearing them.
* The reading for this word is different from both of the kanji readings you learned. This word sounds a lot like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Jews</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゅず](https://jisho.org/search/じゅず)</span>), so we'll have to go with that. Just imagine a Jewish rosary or prayer beads, with a Jewish person using it.
* 数, 珠
* Count, Pearl
* [sound:数珠_b.mp3]
