## Mnemonics:
私がこの一ドル硬貨を十分速く回したら、もしかすると百ドル札になるかもしれない。
* If I spin a one dollar coin fast enough, maybe it will turn into a one hundred dollar bill.
* You've probably seen the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [回る](https://jisho.org/search/回る)</span>, which means to revolve. This word is similar, except for you're doing the turning/rotating action on something else. You can simply say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to turn</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to rotate</span> when answering this question, but be sure to think of yourself actually turning/rotating something. Remember this by using the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span> on the end. You've taken your friend <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Sue</span> and put her on a stick. You're rotating her over a fire on a spit because you're a sick cannibal.
* The reading is the same as the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [回る](https://jisho.org/search/回る)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まわ](https://jisho.org/search/まわ)</span>). So long as you know that level 5 word, you'll be able to read this one as well. Use both of these words together to remember their readings.
