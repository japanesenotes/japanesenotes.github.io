## Mnemonics:
不思議な船が港に漂着した。
* There was a mysterious ship drifting in the harbor.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* This is a single kanji with no okurigana, so it's using the kun'yomi reading. You don't know this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You go down to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> harbor</span> and speak the secret password <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> me natto</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みなと](https://jisho.org/search/みなと)</span>) to buy some fresh natto. Imagine the salty air hitting your face as you whisper, me natto. Now eat that yummy natto by the water! Mmmm!
