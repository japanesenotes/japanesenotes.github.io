## Mnemonics:
ホビットの穴に住んでみたいのですが、どうやって掘ればいいのか分かりません。
* I want to live in a hobbit hole, but I don’t know how to dig.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dwelling</span>, so the verb version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to dwell</span>. It can also mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to live</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to reside</span>. Basically, someone is living somewhere. Where do you live?
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have a place to live... but not for long. You are being <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue</span>d (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span>) out of your house and home so you will have nowhere <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to dwell</span>.
* 住
* Dwelling
* [sound:住む_b.mp3]
* [sound:住む_g.mp3]
