## Mnemonics:
学期末試験は三月なので、まだまだ勉強する時間はたっぷりあります。
* Final exams are held in March so there's still plenty of time to prepare.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> study</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> period of time</span> isn't the pitiful amount of time you spend studying. It's something much bigger: the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> school term</span>. Ugh, how much longer is this study period of time???
* The reading is on'yomi because it's a jukugo word but <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がく](https://jisho.org/search/がく)</span> gets shortened to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がっ](https://jisho.org/search/がっ)</span>, so be careful. Maybe you just wish the school term would get shorter which is why you shortened <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がく](https://jisho.org/search/がく)</span> like that?
* 学, 期
* Study, Period Of Time
