## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> transparent</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be transparent</span> (since usually people can't to transparent something).
* To remember the reading, just think about something that is supposed to not be transparent, but is transparent after you give it to someone for a while. You're so upset that your (dog/cat/plant/car/etc) is transparent that you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue</span> the guy who was supposed to not make it transparent.
