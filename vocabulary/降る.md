## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> descend</span>, but this word means something closer to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to fall</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to come down</span>. Usually used with things like rain or snow.
* The rain is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to fall</span> and you're outside anyway with your mouth open so you'll get a mouth <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> full</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふる](https://jisho.org/search/ふる)</span>) of rainwater! All the ponds, wells, and your yard will be full of water too!
