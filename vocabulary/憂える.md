## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grieve</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to grieve</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be anxious</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Your aunt starts <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to grieve</span> really loudly at your Uncle Ray's funeral. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ooh, Ray</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)れ</span>)! OOoh, Ray why did you have to leave me! It's really sad. You even hear it in your head after you've left and gone home. You've never seen someone start <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be distressed</span> like that in public.
