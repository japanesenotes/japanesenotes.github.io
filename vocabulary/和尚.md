## Mnemonics:

* 
* Who works for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> peace</span> and is held in high <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> esteem</span>? A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Buddhist high priest</span>. They work harder than anyone else to reach world peace so they're held in very high esteem.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [和](https://jisho.org/search/和)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />The only thing you ever hear the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Buddhist High Priest</span> say is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> O</span>ooooo (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)</span>). It must be some kind of Buddhist humming or chanting. Every time you think about him you hear that o sound in your head.
* 和, 尚
* Peace, Furthermore
