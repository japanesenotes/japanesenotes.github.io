* Wow! The way you talk sounds just like a native Japanese person.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> way</span> of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> speak</span>ing is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> way of speaking</span> (or it could be your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> speaking style</span>). This is how someone talks. Some people have an interesting speaking style, after all.
* The readings come from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [話す](https://jisho.org/search/話す)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [方](https://jisho.org/search/方)</span>. By now you should have seen these words separately and should be able to read this word too.
