* If <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [閉める](https://jisho.org/search/閉める)</span> is to shut or to close this is going to be the version where you don't do anything and something shuts on its own. This word is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be shut</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be closed</span>. You know this because you put your hand in the door to open it, but then it shuts (on its own) on your hand, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> marring</span> your hand forever.
* The reading is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [閉める](https://jisho.org/search/閉める)</span>.
