## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Swim into a floating group of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seaweed</span> and shivers will go up your spine. It feels so gross and slimy that you can't help but <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mo</span>an (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [も](https://jisho.org/search/も)</span>) out in distress.
