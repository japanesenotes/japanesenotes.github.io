## Mnemonics:
どろぼうはぬすんだものをすべて出してくばった。
* The thief handed out all the goods he stole.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means exit and this is kind of a verb form of this. The word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to take out</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to hand out</span>, so it's like you're doing the action of causing something else to exit (rather than exiting yourself). You can remember this because the hiragana <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span> is like the word sue. Imagine yourself grabbing her and removing her from a box. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [スーを出す](https://jisho.org/search/スーを出す)</span>.
* The part of the word that you have to learn how to read is the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だ](https://jisho.org/search/だ)</span> portion. So, you already removed Sue from the box. Who else is in there that you have to remove? It's your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Da</span>d (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だ](https://jisho.org/search/だ)</span>) as well. Go ahead and remove him from the box as well.
* 出
