* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> street</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> road</span> is as wide as a street plus a road combined together. So cool! So wide! It's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> highway</span>!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It uses the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かい](https://jisho.org/search/かい)</span> reading (not the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がい](https://jisho.org/search/がい)</span>) because it's at the beginning of the word.
* 街, 道
* Street, Road
