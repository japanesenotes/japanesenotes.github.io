## Mnemonics:
金魚が泣いている音を聞いたことはある？
* Have you ever heard the sound that a goldfish makes when it cries?
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />Did you hear that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sound</span>? It's barely <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> audi</span>ble (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おと](https://jisho.org/search/おと)</span>). Go ahead and say the word audible with the pronunciation of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おと](https://jisho.org/search/おと)</span> to help you to remember this.
* 音
* Sound
* [sound:音_b.mp3]
* [sound:音_g.mp3]
