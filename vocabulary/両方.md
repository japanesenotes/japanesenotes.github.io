* Nope. They’re both mine.
* Here you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> both</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> direction</span>s / <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> way</span>s. Every time you have to choose between something it's like having to choose between two ways. That's why this word is simply <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> both</span>. <br />Close to the kanji is the meaning <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> both sides</span>, as well. Learn either for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [両方](https://jisho.org/search/両方)</span>, they're pretty similar.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
* 両, 方
* Both, Direction
* [sound:両方_b.mp3]
* [sound:両方_g.mp3]
