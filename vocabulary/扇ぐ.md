## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> folding fan</span> and since you don't to folding fan something, this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to fan</span> instead.
* Imagine yourself trying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to fan</span> yourself with an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 青</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あお](https://jisho.org/search/あお)</span>) fan. For some reason blue fans feel cooler. Maybe it's because they're the color of ice/water?
