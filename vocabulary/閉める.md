## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> closed</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to close</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to close</span> the door or the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>) will come in. Not just one sheep, or two, but hundreds of sheep. They'll see you didn't manage <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to shut</span> that door properly, and when you turn around your house will be covered floor to ceiling with fat squishy sheep.
