## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> leg</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> book</span> is just the legs of a book. Not a whole book. It only contains the parts that walk around and move, not so much the descriptions (things that don't move). This kind of book is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> script</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> screenplay</span>. These books are focused on actions and things people say, which is why it's just the legs.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
* 脚, 本
* Leg, Book
