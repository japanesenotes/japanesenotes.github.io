## Mnemonics:
「あなた、今夜の予定は？」「昔の飲み仲間とちょっと出かけてくる予定だよ。」
* What are your plans for tonight Darling? I’m going out with my old drinking buddies.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This is a good way to start stories, by the way: <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [昔々に…](https://jisho.org/search/昔々に…)</span> (Long, long ago).
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [むかし](https://jisho.org/search/むかし)</span> sounds like a kun'yomi reading, doesn't it? It's so long.
* 昔
* Long Ago
* [sound:昔_b.mp3]
