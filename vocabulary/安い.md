## Mnemonics:
アパートの屋根から投げて粉々になるのを見てみたかったので、昨日すごく安いラジオを買った。
* I bought a very cheap radio yesterday just so I could throw it off the roof of my apartment and watch it shatter.
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cheap</span>? It's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cheap</span>. Time to go to a 100<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [円](https://jisho.org/search/円)</span> shop and get some <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [安い](https://jisho.org/search/安い)</span> goods, ammiright?
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Would you like this item for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cheap</span>? <br />Uh, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yes</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [やす](https://jisho.org/search/やす)</span>) please! 
* 安
* Relax
