## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: For as long as you can remember, your family and another family has had a bloody <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> feud</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふで](https://jisho.org/search/ふで)</span>) over this one <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> writing brush</span>. Just think of all the people killed over this brush. This feud has to end.
