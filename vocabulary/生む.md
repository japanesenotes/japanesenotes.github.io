## Mnemonics:
おっとの子ではなかったが、生むしかなかった。
* Even though it wasn’t my husband’s, I had no choice but to give birth to the baby.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means life so what is the verb form of that? Would it be to do life? No, probably not. In this case it is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to give birth</span>.<br />You'll have to differentiate this one from the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [生まれる](https://jisho.org/search/生まれる)</span> as well. You can remember that this one means to give birth because when you compare, the act of giving birth probably feels shorter than the act of being birthed, at least in terms of sheer terror. The pain of giving birth will make it feel quick, when you look back on it... but just imagine how traumatized the baby must be from going through that as well. So, the act of giving birth is shorter, just like the word itself!
* You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> part of this word to be able to read it. It's the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [生まれる](https://jisho.org/search/生まれる)</span>, so that could help if you've learned that word already. If not, just imagine yourself giving birth, and all you can do is scream: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> UUuUUuuUUuUuu!</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span>).
