## Mnemonics:

* 
* An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> aunt</span> on your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mother</span>'s side is still your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> aunt</span>. This aunt always has to be younger than her though. 
* The reading for this word is an exception. But you already learned the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [伯母](https://jisho.org/search/伯母)</span> which means aunt too. Well they have the same reading! So if you know one aunt, you know them all!
