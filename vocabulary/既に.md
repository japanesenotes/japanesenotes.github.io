## Mnemonics:

* 
* One of the meanings is the same as the kanji, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> previously</span>, but it can also mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> already</span>.
* The reading is different from what you learned with the kanji. But as I told you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> already</span>, I'll be there on <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Su-day</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すで](https://jisho.org/search/すで)</span>). It's like Sunday, but not quite the same. Imagine your confusion when someone says this over and over, but you don't know what Suday is.
* 既
* Previously
* [sound:既に_b.mp3]
