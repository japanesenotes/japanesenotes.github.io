## Mnemonics:
もしタイムマシーンがあったなら、紀元前三千年紀に行ってみたいな。
* If time machines existed, I would want to go to 3000 B.C.
* Remember how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [紀元後](https://jisho.org/search/紀元後)</span> is After death or AD? Well, this is the opposite because it has a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> before</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [前](https://jisho.org/search/前)</span>) in it. It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> BC</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Before Christ</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will also help if you know how to read <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [紀元後](https://jisho.org/search/紀元後)</span> already, because then you'll just have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [前](https://jisho.org/search/前)</span>.
* 紀, 元, 前
* Account, Origin, Front
* [sound:紀元前_b.mp3]
* [sound:紀元前_g.mp3]
