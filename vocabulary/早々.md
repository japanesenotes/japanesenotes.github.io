## Mnemonics:
新年早々、借金を催促されるなんてひどすぎる。
* It’s too cruel to demand money right after the start of the new year.
* Essentially you have the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [早](https://jisho.org/search/早)</span></span> twice, because <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [々](https://jisho.org/search/々)</span> is just a repeater kanji. When you have something <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> early</span> twice, it obviously has some kind of urgency to it. You'll need to take an action <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> as soon as</span> you finish whatever it is you're doing there.
* The reading is just the on'yomi readings (which you learned with the kanji) twice in a row.
* 早, 々
* Early, Repeater
* [sound:早々_b.mp3]
* [sound:早々_g.mp3]
