## Mnemonics:
この前、思わずノートをとるぐらい完璧な日没を見たのはいつだったかな？
* When was the last time I saw a sunset so perfect that I had to take note of it?
* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [この](https://jisho.org/search/この)</span> means this. And, you know what the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [前](https://jisho.org/search/前)</span> means (front/before). So this before has to do with something that happened previously. That's why this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> last time</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> recently</span>, and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lately</span>.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [前](https://jisho.org/search/前)</span> is the kun'yomi, like the reading for the vocabulary word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [前](https://jisho.org/search/前)</span>. So long as you know that word, you'll be able to read this one too. The reason it's not on'yomi is because it's like two words put together. The word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [この](https://jisho.org/search/この)</span> and the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [前](https://jisho.org/search/前)</span>.
* 前
* Front
* [sound:この前_b.mp3]
* [sound:この前_g.mp3]
