## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> river</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> juvenile</span>... not what you think. It's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kappa</span>, a mythological Japanese creature. That being said, it lives in / around rivers and is about the size of a juvenile, so maybe this makes sense.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [河](https://jisho.org/search/河)</span> makes sense. The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [童](https://jisho.org/search/童)</span> however is weird. Since the meaning is kappa though you can use that to remember the reading as well. If you don't know what a kappa is do some research on the internets and figure out about them. It's interesting, and it will help you to remember this word.
* 河, 童
* River, Juvenile
