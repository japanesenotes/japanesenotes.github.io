* This has the same meaning as the kanji, specifically the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> how much</span> meaning. To remember this, just think about how <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ra</span>, the Egyptian God, is always asking <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> How much</span> will it cost to build this pyramid? Ugh, too much, let's hire some slaves.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
* 幾
* How Many
