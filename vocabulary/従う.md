## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> obey</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to obey</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: I am going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to obey</span> you, but just know I think your order is a bit of shit, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [が](https://jisho.org/search/が)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [したが](https://jisho.org/search/したが)</span>) I'll do it and obey you.
* 従
* Obey
* [sound:従う_b.mp3]
* [sound:従う_g.mp3]
