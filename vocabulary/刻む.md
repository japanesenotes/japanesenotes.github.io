## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> carve</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to carve</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to carve</span> up the steak, you wish you could use a knife, but you don't have one. Instead, you'll have to use your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> keys</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きざ](https://jisho.org/search/きざ)</span>) to cut it. Imagine trying to cut up the steak with these keys. It's very difficult.
