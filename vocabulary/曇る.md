## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cloudy</span> and the verb vocab version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to get cloudy</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to become cloudy</span>.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. It also happens to be the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [雲](https://jisho.org/search/雲)</span>, which has a very similar meaning (clouds).
* 曇
* Cloudy
* [sound:曇る_b.mp3]
* [sound:曇る_g.mp3]
