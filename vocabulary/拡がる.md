## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> extend</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to extend</span>.
* Does the kanji look familiar, kind of like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [広い](https://jisho.org/search/広い)</span>, perhaps? This word shares the same reading as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [広い](https://jisho.org/search/広い)</span>, and the meanings are kind of similar too! That means <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [拡がる](https://jisho.org/search/拡がる)</span> is read as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ひろがる</span>.
