## Mnemonics:
三年二組のコウイチくん、またこく白されたらしいよ。
* I heard Koichi in grade 3 class 2 was asked out again.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. 
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />You're part of a special <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> group</span>. It is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cumi</span>n group, and they deal with all things cumin (the spice / seed). Smell the cumin. Touch it. Taste it. You live and breathe the stuff, because you are the president of this cumin group.<br />P.S. This can also be spelled <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [組み](https://jisho.org/search/組み)</span> (same overall reading: <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くみ](https://jisho.org/search/くみ)</span>).
