## Mnemonics:
コウイチは罪なき一般市民を殺害した人は雇わないと思うよ。
* I don’t think Koichi would hire anyone who has committed the crime of murdering innocent civilians.
* If you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> guilt</span> then you have committed a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sin</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crime</span>. Come here and confess to Father Koichi.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: When you come to confess your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sin</span> to me, you start claiming it wasn't you. You say it was some other version of you! What? How could this be? Well, you say there are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two me</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つみ](https://jisho.org/search/つみ)</span>) out there! One is doing the bad stuff, and the other is you, and you haven't done any sins!
* 罪
* Guilt
