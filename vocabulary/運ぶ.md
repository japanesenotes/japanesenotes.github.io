## Mnemonics:
この教科書を運ぶための鞄がほしい。
* I want a bag to carry these textbooks.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> carry</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to carry</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Imagine you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to carry</span> a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hawk</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はこ](https://jisho.org/search/はこ)</span>). Imagine carrying it in your hands, it trying to claw and peck itself free, but you don't let go. It is your job to carry this hawk with you everywhere.
