## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accumulate</span> and the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to accumulate</span>.
* If something accumulates, you can start with one, but you need at least <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>) things to say it has accumulated. If you don't, then there's nothing accumulating at all.
* 積
* Accumulate
* [sound:積もる_b.mp3]
