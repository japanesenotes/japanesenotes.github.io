## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> watch over</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> board</span> is a board that goes over your store and watches over everything. What board on a store watches everything? It's the one that gets the most visibility, so it's probably the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> store sign</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
