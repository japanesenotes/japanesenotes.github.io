## Mnemonics:
彼の家には金も有るが、屋根の上に銀も有る。
* There is gold in his house as well as silver on his roof.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> have</span> and so the verb version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to have</span>. An alternative meaning is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to exist</span> though this refers only to non-living inanimate things, not moving and living things. So really, this is similar to to have as well.<br />These kanji aren't used too often, so when you're writing just use the kana. But you'll see the kanji used sometimes so it's important to be able to recognize them!
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br /><span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> To have</span> something is very nice. But now, the only thing you possess are screams. Imagine this. You are in a totally empty room with no possessions. You open a little box and look inside. It contains screams that yell: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> AAAAHHHH</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あ](https://jisho.org/search/あ)</span>).
* 有
* Have
* [sound:有る_b.mp3]
* [sound:有る_g.mp3]
