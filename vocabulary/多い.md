## Mnemonics:
電車にはとても多くの乗客が乗っていたので、眠ることはできなかったが、大声で歌うことはできた。
* I wasn’t able to sleep because there were far too many people on the train, so I just sang loudly instead.
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> many</span>? It is also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> many</span> (or you could say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> much</span>). Speaking of which, there are so many kanji to learn, ammiright?
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Think of something that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> many</span>. Doesn't matter what it is as long as you imagine a ridiculous number of them. Many of them. So many that they start avalanching into you and crushing you. The last thing you yell is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> おお</span>!!! as you get smushed.
* 多
* Many
