## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> replace</span>. This word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be replaced</span>. You can differentiate it from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [替える](https://jisho.org/search/替える)</span>, which has you doing the action of replacing, by thinking that with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> わる</span> Wario is doing the replacing for you, not you, making this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be replaced</span>.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
* 替
* Replace
