## Mnemonics:
コウイチはフグを優しく撫でてから、地面に降ろしてあげました。
* Koichi gently stroked Fugu and placed him on the ground.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ground</span>/<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> earth</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> face</span> is the surface that makes up the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ground</span> or the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Earth's surface</span>.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [面](https://jisho.org/search/面)</span> is what you'd expect. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [地](https://jisho.org/search/地)</span> on the other hand is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span>, which is a bit different (though close sounding) to what you learned previously. Thank the Chinese and their ever changing language for this one. Think of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Je</span>sus laying on the ground, telling you how comfortable the ground is. You say Jesus, you have to get off the ground, you have a dinner to go to, but he doesn't want to leave.
