## Mnemonics:
弱虫毛虫は、挟んで捨てろ！
* Cowards should be treated like hairy caterpillars - picked up and thrown out!
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> weak</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> insect</span>. This is what people call <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> weakling</span>s in Japan. This is a good word to know if you're a bully, or something.
* The reading for this one is a weird one. It uses the kun'yomi readings for both, meaning you'll have to pull your knowledge of the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [弱い](https://jisho.org/search/弱い)</span> from earlier and apply it here. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [虫](https://jisho.org/search/虫)</span> should be okay, though, as this is the reading you learned with the kanji.<br />Just remember, only weak bugs use kun'yomi, and that weak bug is you in this instance.
* 弱, 虫
* Weak, Insect
* [sound:弱虫_b.mp3]
* [sound:弱虫_g.mp3]
