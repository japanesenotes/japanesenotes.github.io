## Mnemonics:

* 
* Remember how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [縛る](https://jisho.org/search/縛る)</span> means to tie? Well if you tie something around someone's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neck</span> then it's called <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hanging</span>. They'll probably die from it too, so it can also be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> death by hanging</span>. 
* This is a combination of the words <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [縛る](https://jisho.org/search/縛る)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [首](https://jisho.org/search/首)</span>. Both use the kun'yomi readings, so just change the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span> to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [り](https://jisho.org/search/り)</span> and it's pretty simple!
* 縛, 首
* Bind, Neck
* [sound:縛り首_b.mp3]
