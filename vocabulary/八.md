## Mnemonics:
八じ？ほんとうに、八じ？
* Eight o’clock? Are you sure it’s eight o’clock?
* When a vocab is a single kanji it usually steals its meaning from its kanji as well. Same goes for this vocab word. It means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eight</span>.
* When a vocab is a single kanji and all alone like this, it's usually going to use the kun'yomi. But, because this is a number (exception) it uses the on'yomi instead, meaning you already know the reading from when you learned the kanji!
* 八
* Eight
* [sound:八_b.mp3]
