## Mnemonics:
ちちの五十五才のたんじょう日に、ホグワーツへしょうたいされた。
* On my dad’s fifty-fifth birthday, I was invited to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
* Although this word consists of one kanji that is all alone, it doesn't share its meaning with the parent kanji. The meanings are similar in a way, though. This word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> years old</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> age</span>. With more years comes more <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> genius</span>, right? That's why this word means years old and not genius, like the parent kanji. <br />Hint: Stick this word onto numbers to say how old someone is!
* The reading is the same as the one you learned for the kanji, meaning you should already know it! Don't try to type the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [〜](https://jisho.org/search/〜)</span> part though.
* 才
* Genius
* [sound:〜才_b.mp3]
* [sound:〜才_g.mp3]
