## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />When thinking about the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> circumstances</span> of your current situation and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reason</span> you're there (which is studying kanji and vocab). Who's fault is it? It's WaniKani's fault! But, your brain has been beaten to a mush from all the studying, so when you say it's your fault it comes out as it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yue</span> fault! Go ahead and say it out loud that way.
