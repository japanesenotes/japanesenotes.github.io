## Mnemonics:

* 
* If you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> decorate</span> your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spirit</span> with a bunch of pretty things like streamers and balloons, people will think you're just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> showing off</span>. Yes, you know your spirit is awesome, but everyone else doesn't want it pushed in their face with your over the top decorations.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [気](https://jisho.org/search/気)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />At the height of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> showing off</span>, you bend one arm to your hip and the other out in the air. You pretend to be a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ke</span>ttle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [け](https://jisho.org/search/け)</span>). You show off your spirit to all your friends singing I'm a little ke-ttle, short and stout. Here is my handle, here is my spout. EVERYONE LOOK HOW GREAT I AM! Your kettle dance is sure to impress them.
* 飾, 気
* Decorate, Energy
