* This word is pretty weird. It has two distinct sort of meanings. One is the not so good meaning, and the other is the delicate meaning. Lately the not so good meaning has taken priority, I think, so let's focus on that for now. Something is both <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> delicate</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> strange</span>. This delicate strange thing really is just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> not so good</span>. It's not terrible, but it's not great either. It's just not so good. Why? Because if you touch it too hard, it will break. Also, it's not that normal either, so it's not helpful to you. Imagine a thing that could be like this, then think: Is this good? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> not really</span>. It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> not so good</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 微, 妙
* Delicate, Strange
