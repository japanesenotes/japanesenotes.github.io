## Mnemonics:
私の国の東側出身の人達は変わった方言で喋るので、彼らが何を言っているのか全く分かりません。
* People from the eastern part of my country use such an odd dialect that they are impossible to understand.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> way</span> you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> say</span> things could be translated as your accent... but this is much bigger. This is an entire way of speaking. This is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dialect</span>. <br />You can even think of the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [方](https://jisho.org/search/方)</span> as being direction where you go in different directions in a country and discover different dialects, if that way of thinking helps.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
* 方, 言
* Direction, Say
