## Mnemonics:
よく「本音と建前」は日本独特の文化だと言われますが、実際は世界中に存在します。
* It’s often said that the contrast between one’s personal feelings and public behavior is a characteristic unique to Japanese culture, but that exists all over the world.
* What you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> build</span> up in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> front</span> of other people is your public image. This is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> public behavior</span>, how you act around others you don't really know. This concept is surprisingly important in Japan, so you'll hear it often enough despite being such a strange concept in other places. You'll have to think of this like you're building buildings of personality in front of you. These show off who you are on the outside, but it protects what's on the inside.
* The reading is pretty strange. It's a lot like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [建物](https://jisho.org/search/建物)</span> in that it's read as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たて](https://jisho.org/search/たて)</span>, which is like the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [建てる](https://jisho.org/search/建てる)</span> even though the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [て](https://jisho.org/search/て)</span> isn't showing here. So, you'll have to remember it's read like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [建てる](https://jisho.org/search/建てる)</span> but the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [て](https://jisho.org/search/て)</span> gets pushed into the kanji.
* 建, 前
* Build, Front
* [sound:建前_b.mp3]
