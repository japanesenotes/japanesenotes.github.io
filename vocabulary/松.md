## Mnemonics:
わたしの小学校では、クラスを一組、二組、とは分けずに、松組、竹組で分けていました。
* In my elementary school, classrooms were labeled pine class and bamboo class rather than 1st class, 2nd class, and so on.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, so no need to think too hard.
