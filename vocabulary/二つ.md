## Mnemonics:
かれの二つめのあくぎょうは、かえるのあんさつだ。
* His second evil deed was the frog’s assassination.
* This word follows the number of things pattern where there's a kanji for a number plus <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span> on the end. Whenever you see this, you know the word means ____ things. Knowing that, as long as you know the kanji (which you do) you can figure out what number of things it is. For this one, it's the kanji for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two</span> plus <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>. So, this one is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two things</span>.
* Since all of the number of things words all follow the same pattern (number plus <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>), you really just have to remember the part before the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span> (and then remember that the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span> is in all of these). All of the readings are the kun'yomi reading, which means we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember them (you know the on'yomi reading of the kanji portion).<br />So what thing do you have two of? The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two things</span> that you have consist of one foot and another <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foot</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふた](https://jisho.org/search/ふた)</span>). Remember from the on'yomi how you had two knees (for the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [に](https://jisho.org/search/に)</span>)? Now look further down your leg at one foot then over to the other foot. Two foot!
