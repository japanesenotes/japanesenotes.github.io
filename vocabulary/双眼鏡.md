## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pair</span> of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eyeball</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mirror</span>s - that's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> binoculars</span>. Binoculars have mirrors in them to allow you to see through the pair of eye holes, which is how this word makes sense.
* The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [鏡](https://jisho.org/search/鏡)</span> part uses the on'yomi reading, which you didn't learn. To remember this, just think about how when you look down binoculars, you see something strange (like a strange reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [鏡](https://jisho.org/search/鏡)</span>). That strange thing you see through these fantastic binoculars is... tomorrow. Your binoculars are so strong that you can already see tomorrow, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> today</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょう](https://jisho.org/search/きょう)</span>)!
* 双, 眼, 鏡
