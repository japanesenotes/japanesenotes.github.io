## Mnemonics:
コンドームも全く安全だって訳はない。俺の友達はゴムを着けてたけど、軽トラにはねられたしな。
* Condoms aren’t completely safe. My friend was wearing one and got hit by a pickup truck.
* This is the adverb version of the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> all</span>. So, it's like you add an 'ly' to it. But, that doesn't work too well (allly? c'mon). So, instead think of this word as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> completely</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> entirely</span> or one of the other definitions listed above.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />The person who <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> completely</span> doesn't understand this vocab word is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> matt</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まった](https://jisho.org/search/まった)</span>). Be sure to take note of the small <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [っ](https://jisho.org/search/っ)</span>, too.
* 全
* All
