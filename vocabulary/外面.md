## Mnemonics:
彼の外面に騙されない方がいいですよ。私がインストラクターのことが嫌いだったのは、上司にはいい顔をして陰で後輩のことを小突き回していたからです。
* You shouldn’t be fooled by his outward appearance. I hated my instructor because he showed his superiors a nice face while he bullied subordinates, including me, behind their backs.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> outside</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> face</span> to something is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exterior</span> of that thing.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. This reading is usually for building exteriors and outside surfaces. The other reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そとづら](https://jisho.org/search/そとづら)</span> is used when a person's personality comes to the surface and is a bit of an exception, so you'll probably see it less often. Just keep those differences in mind!
* 外, 面
* Outside, Face
* [sound:外面_b.mp3]
* [sound:外面_g.mp3]
