## Mnemonics:
ようやく直接お話することができてよかったです。まさか駅でバッタリお会いするなんて思ってもいませんでしたよ。
* It was nice finally talking to you in person. I never thought I would run into you at a station.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Usually this refers to a train station in particular, but can be any kind of station.
* The kanji here uses <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [えき](https://jisho.org/search/えき)</span> as both its on'yomi and kun'yomi, so no worries here. You can go to this station or that station, and both stations will use the same reading as the kanji it comes from.
* 駅
* Station
* [sound:駅_b.mp3]
