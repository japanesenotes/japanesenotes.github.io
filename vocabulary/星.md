## Mnemonics:
お父さん、どうして今日は星型の眼鏡をかけているの？
* Dad, why are you wearing star-shaped glasses today?
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> star</span> is just a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> who</span>le <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほし](https://jisho.org/search/ほし)</span>) floating in the sky. If it wasn't a whole sheep, it wouldn't shine so brightly and you wouldn't be able to see it from Earth. Don't let anyone tell you stars are made of gas. The whole thing is sheep, okay?
