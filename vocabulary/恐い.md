## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fear</span>? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Scary</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> frightening</span>. It can also mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> I'm afraid</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> I'm scared </span> too.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You know what's really scary? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Koa</span>las (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こわ](https://jisho.org/search/こわ)</span>). Have you ever heard one of those things? They're super scary, don't go near them.
