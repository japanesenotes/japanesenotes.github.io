## Mnemonics:
生ビール一ちょう、下さーい。
* Give me a draft beer!
* Normally a single kanji alone like this would mean the same thing as its parent kanji, but in the case of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 生</span> it's a little different (but still related). When you think of something that has life, it's something that's very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fresh</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> raw</span>. Think sashimi or sushi, for example. You want that to be as close as possible to life as you can. That's why you eat it when it's fresh, and that's also when you eat it raw.<br />You'll see this word at the beginning of other words. For example, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [生たまご](https://jisho.org/search/生たまご)</span> is raw egg.
* This uses one of the kun'yomi readings. To remember this one, though, think this:<br />When you get a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> raw</span> fish in Japan, you never want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> name</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なま](https://jisho.org/search/なま)</span>) it, because you'll probably have to eat it (and that would be traumatizing!). Just imagine yourself actually doing that - how terrible would that be?
