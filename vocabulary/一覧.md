* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> One</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> look at</span>... just one. A little one. Just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a look</span>. Just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a glance</span>. That's all I want.<br />It also has another meaning! When you're talking about computers and you want to see everything in one look, you will arrange it into a nice <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> list</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> table</span>. That way you only have to look at the data one time!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 一, 覧
* One, Look At
