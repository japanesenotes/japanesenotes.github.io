## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> angry</span>, the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to get angry</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You're starting <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to get angry</span> about something. It's mostly this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ok</span>ra (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おこ](https://jisho.org/search/おこ)</span>). It tastes terrible.
* 怒
* Angry
* [sound:怒る_b.mp3]
* [sound:怒る_g.mp3]
