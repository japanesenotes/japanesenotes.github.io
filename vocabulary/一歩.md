## Mnemonics:
最初の一歩を踏み出すのに勇気がいる。
* It takes courage to take the first step forward.
* If <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [歩](https://jisho.org/search/歩)</span></span> is walk and you take <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> one</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> walk</span>, then really you are just taking <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> one step</span>. When there's a number before <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [歩](https://jisho.org/search/歩)</span>, it refers to the number of steps you're taking. The most common is this one, and you'll see it on urinals when they kindly ask you to please take one step forward because peeing isn't a game and somebody has to clean up after you.
* The reading is pretty standard in its trickiness. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いち](https://jisho.org/search/いち)</span> shortens to an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いっ](https://jisho.org/search/いっ)</span> and the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほ](https://jisho.org/search/ほ)</span> rendakus to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぽ](https://jisho.org/search/ぽ)</span>. One step at a time, right?
* 一, 歩
* One, Walk
* [sound:一歩_b.mp3]
* [sound:一歩_g.mp3]
