## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> greatness</span>? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Great</span>! 
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />The only thing a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> great</span> person doesn't do is make <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> error</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [えら](https://jisho.org/search/えら)</span>). That's what makes them so great. They can always sense when an error is about to happen and they correct it before it even has a chance!
