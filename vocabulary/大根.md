## Mnemonics:
おお、これいいんじゃねえ？めちゃくちゃいい大根だよ。お前も、一本欲しいか？
* Hey, check it out! These are really nice Japanese radishes. Do you want one of these too?
* This will be easier if you've seen or heard of daikon before. It's a really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> big</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> root</span> in the ground that's pretty delicious. It's known as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> daikon</span> in the grocery stores for the most part, though occasionally you'll see it as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Japanese radish</span> instead.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [大](https://jisho.org/search/大)</span> uses the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だい](https://jisho.org/search/だい)</span> reading because if you try to put the whole thing in your mouth at once you'll probably end up choking and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dy</span>ing. 
* 大, 根
* Big, Root
