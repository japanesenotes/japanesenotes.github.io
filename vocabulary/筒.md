## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Additionally, a cylinder is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pipe</span> as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: When it comes to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pipe</span>s, you always want to have two sets of two of them, just in case. So, that's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two two</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つつ](https://jisho.org/search/つつ)</span>) set of pipes, lined up next to each other for backup.
