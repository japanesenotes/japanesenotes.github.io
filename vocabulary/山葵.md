## Mnemonics:

* 
* If you dig up <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hollyhock</span>s in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mountain</span>s, and grind up their roots, you'll have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wasabi</span>! Don't eat too much, or you'll burn your tongue off.
* This reading is an exception, but I'm sure (at least I hope) that you've heard the word wasabi before. It's the same in Japanese so just remember the meaning and you'll know the reading too!
* 山, 葵
