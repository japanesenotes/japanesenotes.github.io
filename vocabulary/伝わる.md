## Mnemonics:
忍者トーフグ組が夜に城へ忍び寄ったということが、コウイチ将軍に伝わった。
* A message about how the Tofugu ninjas crept towards the castle during the night was transmitted to Shogun Koichi.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb.<br />This is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. Something is transmitted. No direct object here. That's why this verb means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be transmitted</span>.
* Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading.<br />Lucky for you, the kanji readings for transitive and intransitive verbs are almost always the same. Once you learn one, you know them both! This reading is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [伝える](https://jisho.org/search/伝える)</span>.
* 伝
* Transmit
