## Mnemonics:
今日は一日中晴れて、青空が広がっていました。
* Today, it was sunny all day and the blue sky was above us.
* This is simply a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blue</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sky</span> (aka a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blue sky</span>!).
* You'd think that this word would use on'yomi readings to read it, but it doesn't (shake that angry fist at the kanji gods!). Instead, it's double kun'yomi, probably because this word is really like two separate words put together, blue and sky. In the previous level you unlocked these two separate words, learning their readings. That means you should be able to read this as well. <br />One quick note is the rendaku-fication of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [空](https://jisho.org/search/空)</span> as well. It becomes <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぞら](https://jisho.org/search/ぞら)</span>.
* 青, 空
* Blue, Sky
* [sound:青空_b.mp3]
* [sound:青空_g.mp3]
