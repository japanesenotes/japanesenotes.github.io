## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reach</span> and the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to reach</span>. This is like x reached y or x amounted to y. Not so much reaching out and touching something.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Oh, yo</span>, if you want to reach that number, you'll have to try harder.
* 及
* Reach
* [sound:及ぶ_b.mp3]
* [sound:及ぶ_g.mp3]
