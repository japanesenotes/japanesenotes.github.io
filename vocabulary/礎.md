## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* A foundation is made of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stone</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いし](https://jisho.org/search/いし)</span>). And it holds up an entire <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> zoo A</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ずえ](https://jisho.org/search/ずえ)</span>) but none of Zoo B. Zoo B will fall apart when an earthquake hits.
