じゃんけんにかって、わたしは天にものぼるきもちだった。
* I won the rock-paper-scissors competition and I felt like I was in heaven.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it would normally use the kun'yomi reading. The kanji that makes this word only has one important reading, though, and that happens to be the on'yomi. Since you learned the on'yomi reading for this kanji, you've already learned the reading for this word.
