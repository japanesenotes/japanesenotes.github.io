## Mnemonics:
七つかぞえると、わたしは女になる。
* After I count to seven, I will be a woman.
* This word follows the number of things pattern where there's a kanji for a number plus <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span> on the end. Whenever you see this, you know the word means ____ things. Knowing that, as long as you know the kanji (which you do) you can figure out what number of things it is. For this one, it's the kanji for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seven</span> plus <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>. So, this one is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seven things</span>.
* Since all of the number of things words all follow the same pattern (number plus <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>), you really just have to remember the part before the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span> (and then remember that the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span> is in all of these). All of the readings are the kun'yomi reading, which means we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember them (you know the on'yomi reading of the kanji portion).<br />What thing do you have seven of? The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seven things</span> that you have are seven <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Nana</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なな](https://jisho.org/search/なな)</span>). These are your grandmas, cloned. Just think, It's lucky to have seven nanas. They can all cook my favorite foods for me!
