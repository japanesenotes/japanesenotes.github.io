## Mnemonics:
予め予習しておいた甲斐がありました。
* Preparing the lesson in advance was worthwhile.
* The kanji and the word are almost exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />What did you do <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beforehand</span>? You had <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a raw cas</span>ual (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あらかじ](https://jisho.org/search/あらかじ)</span>) encounter with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a raw Cage</span>, Nic Cage. You probably should have planned something better <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ahead of time</span>.
* 予
* Beforehand
* [sound:予め_b.mp3]
