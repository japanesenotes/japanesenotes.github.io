## Mnemonics:

* 
* Remember how you learned that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [縛る](https://jisho.org/search/縛る)</span> means to bind? Well if you're being bound because of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gold</span> then you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tied down by money</span>. <br />This word also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sleep paralysis</span>. Just imagine if you were dreaming that your body felt like it had turned to gold and that you were tied down too.
* This is a combination of the words <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [金](https://jisho.org/search/金)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [縛る](https://jisho.org/search/縛る)</span>. Both use the kun'yomi readings, but <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [金](https://jisho.org/search/金)</span> becomes <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かな](https://jisho.org/search/かな)</span> instead of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かね](https://jisho.org/search/かね)</span>. If you can remember that exception, this should be easy!
* 金, 縛
* Gold, Bind
* [sound:金縛り_b.mp3]
* [sound:金縛り_g.mp3]
