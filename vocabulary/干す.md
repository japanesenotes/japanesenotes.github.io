## Mnemonics:
洗濯物を外に干したかったんだけど、物干し竿が壊れちゃって。
* I wanted to put our laundry outside to dry, but our clothesline just broke.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dry</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to dry</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Why do you need to dry something off? Because someone used a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hose</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほす](https://jisho.org/search/ほす)</span>) and got everything all wet. Ugh, you shouldn't leave that hose out anymore...
* 干
* Dry
