## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* The reading is like the reading of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [包み](https://jisho.org/search/包み)</span>, which means bundle or package. Try to think of an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> embankment</span> that's made purely from bundles and packages. These <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 包み</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つつみ](https://jisho.org/search/つつみ)</span>) are the only thing holding the water in!
