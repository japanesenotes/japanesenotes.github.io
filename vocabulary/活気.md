## Mnemonics:
市場は活気にあふれていた。
* The market was overflowing with energy.
* If you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lively</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> energy</span> you have more than enough <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> energy</span> for everyone to start noticing. They come up to you and compliment you on your amazing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> liveliness</span>.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. Just be careful because <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かつ](https://jisho.org/search/かつ)</span> is being shortened here to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かっ](https://jisho.org/search/かっ)</span>. It's a pretty common change for on'yomi ending in <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>, so keep your eyes open for more that do this!
* 活, 気
* Lively, Energy
* [sound:活気_b.mp3]
* [sound:活気_g.mp3]
