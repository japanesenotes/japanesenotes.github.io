## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this meaning, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: <br />There are lots of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> whirlpools</span> at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> u</span>ni <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> zoo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うず](https://jisho.org/search/うず)</span>). Unis really like being spun around in whirlpools, so when you go to the zoo to see them look out for the tank full of them!
