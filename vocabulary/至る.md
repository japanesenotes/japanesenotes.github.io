## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attain</span> but the meaning of this verb is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to arrive at</span>. I suppose that's because if you attain something like enlightenment, you also arrive at that enlightenment as well. Thus, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to arrive at</span>.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> To arrive at</span> enlightenment is to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eat</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いた](https://jisho.org/search/いた)</span>) all the knowledge and understanding that you can. You are enlightened!
