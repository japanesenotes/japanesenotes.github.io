## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gambling</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hit</span> can be multiple things. One type of gambling in Japan that was popular in the day involved betting these awesome wooden block things. You'd gamble by hitting them down on the ground, making a nice thunk sound. Another way to think about it is like blackjack. You want a card? You hit! Either way, it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gambling</span>.
* The reading is weird on this one, but gambling is weird, I guess. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はく](https://jisho.org/search/はく)</span> goes to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばく](https://jisho.org/search/ばく)</span>, maybe because you're playing some gambling <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> back</span>gammon. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ち](https://jisho.org/search/ち)</span> can be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chea</span>ting, where you cheat at this gambling backgammon. So, you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> back</span>gammon <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chea</span>ting (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばく](https://jisho.org/search/ばく)ち</span>), you big cheater.
