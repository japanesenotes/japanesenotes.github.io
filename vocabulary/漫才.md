## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> manga</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> genius</span>! For some reason, this is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> comic dialogue</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two man comedy</span>. Look up manzai on YouTube for some good times if you don't know what this is. It's not exactly the same, but <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [漫](https://jisho.org/search/漫)</span> DOES refer to manga, which is a type of comic book. Take the comic part from comic book, then change it to the haha funny! meaning of comic, and then imagine people doing a dialogue. Then, you have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> comic dialogue</span>. Lots of steps, but hopefully it'll get you there.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. Watch out for the rendaku.
* 漫, 才
* Manga, Genius
