## Mnemonics:
冬休みは、毎日一日中ジョギングをしていました。
* During winter vacation, I jogged everyday, all day long.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> winter</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rest</span>! Wait, nobody calls it that. This is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> winter holiday</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> winter break</span>.
* The readings for these are both the kun'yomi readings. Hopefully you learned them when you were doing vocab in the previous levels so that all you have to do now is combine the two separate words into one bigger word. Please don't take a winter break until you figure this word out.
* 冬, 休
* Winter, Rest
