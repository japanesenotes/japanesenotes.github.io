## Mnemonics:
ロナルド・マクドナルドはいつも大きさのちがうくつをはいていた。
* Ronald McDonald always wore different-sized shoes.
* Words that end with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)</span> are often words that have taken the adjective form (in this case <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [大きい]([大](https://jisho.org/search/大)きい)</span>) of the word and turned into words that describe what the adjective form is doing, if that makes sense. So <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [大きい]([大](https://jisho.org/search/大)きい)</span> (big) goes to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [大きさ]([大](https://jisho.org/search/大)きさ)</span>, and the word that describes what big describes is the word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> size</span>.
* When a vocab has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it is probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. Since you learned the on'yomi reading with the kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [大](https://jisho.org/search/大)</span>, we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember this word.<br />When you saw the size of (pick something surprising), you said <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> おお</span> *#$@! Really imagine something surprising. Say the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おお](https://jisho.org/search/おお)</span> part out loud, as well. Think about the size of whatever you're looking at, too, and how big it is.
* 大
* Big

* [sound:大きさ_g.mp3]
