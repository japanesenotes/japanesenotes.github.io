## Mnemonics:
お前の作る餃子は本当に美味しいな。
* The gyoza you make is really tasty.
* The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)</span> is added to elevate someone in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> front</span> of you. But it's done in a sarcastic way, so this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> you</span>. That's right, plain old you. This you is usually used casually, between men.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [前](https://jisho.org/search/前)</span> is the kun'yomi, like the reading for the vocabulary word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [前](https://jisho.org/search/前)</span>. So long as you know that word, you'll be able to read this one too. 
* 前
* Front
* [sound:お前_b.mp3]
* [sound:お前_g.mp3]
