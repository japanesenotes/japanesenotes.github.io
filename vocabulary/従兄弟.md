* Remember how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [兄弟](https://jisho.org/search/兄弟)</span> means siblings?

They're good and a child. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いいと子](https://jisho.org/search/いいと子)</span>, or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> いとこ</span> for short. Just remember your good, kid cousin. Your <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いとこ](https://jisho.org/search/いとこ)</span> cousin.
