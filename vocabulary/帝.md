## Mnemonics:

* 
* The one true <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sovereign</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Japanese Emperor</span>, aka the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Emperor of Japan</span>. All other emperors aren't simply <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [帝](https://jisho.org/search/帝)</span> on its own.
* To remember the reading, think about how the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Japanese Emperor</span>, can always pull out his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> me card</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みかど](https://jisho.org/search/みかど)</span>) when he's in trouble. It's kind of like how a trump card is the one that's above all the others, but with the emperor he's always up there, so it's a me card to him. And who's gonna argue with the emperor? Not me.
