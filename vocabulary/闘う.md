## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> struggle</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to struggle</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to fight</span>. This struggle is fairly figurative, too. It's more like the struggle against terrorism or the fight against drugs. Not so much a fight with people, which would be <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [戦う](https://jisho.org/search/戦う)</span>.
* Your neighborhood is fighting a struggle against car theft. Sadly, your car was stolen. So, you say: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ta ta, ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たたか](https://jisho.org/search/たたか)</span>). Ta ta.
* 闘
* Struggle
* [sound:闘う_b.mp3]
* [sound:闘う_g.mp3]
