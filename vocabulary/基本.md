* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> origin</span> of your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foundation</span> is where you have to work from when learning something new. For example, the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [基本](https://jisho.org/search/基本)</span> portions of WaniKani are the earlier levels, especially the radicals. They are the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foundation</span> you need to learn your kanji and vocab later on.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
