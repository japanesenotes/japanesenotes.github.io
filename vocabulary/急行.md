## Mnemonics:
あーーーしまったーーーー。急行列車が行ってしまった。ってことは私の遅刻も確定だ。コウイチから受ける処罰がすんごく怖いんですけど。
* Oh noooooo! The express train left. Now I'm going to be late. I’m really scared of being punished by Koichi.
* Things that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hurry</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> go</span> faster than the other things are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> express</span>. This is often used with trains or subways, so look out for it if you're looking to get somewhere in a hurry. Also be careful in case it doesn't stop at your stop, because <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [急行](https://jisho.org/search/急行)</span> trains don't stop at every station (which is what makes them express!).
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 急, 行
* Hurry, Go
* [sound:急行_b.mp3]
* [sound:急行_g.mp3]
