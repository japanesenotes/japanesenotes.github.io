## Mnemonics:
針に糸を通すのは難しい。
* Threading a needle is difficult.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. You already learned that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [通る](https://jisho.org/search/通る)</span> means to pass, but this is a little different. You aren't the one passing, Sue (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span>) is. So you have to let Sue pass. That's why this means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to let pass</span>. 
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading when you learned <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [通る](https://jisho.org/search/通る)</span>. Switch the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span> for a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span> and you'll be all set!
* 通
