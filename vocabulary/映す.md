## Mnemonics:
ビエトだけが、コウイチが鏡に全身を映すのが好きだということを知っている。
* Only Viet knows that Koichi really likes seeing himself reflected full-length in the mirror.
* You know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [映る](https://jisho.org/search/映る)</span> is to be reflected. Now you're doing the reflecting, which is really projecting (light). That's why this word is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to project</span>.
* The reading is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [映る](https://jisho.org/search/映る)</span>. So long as you know the reading of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [映る](https://jisho.org/search/映る)</span> you should be able to read this one too.
* 映
* Reflect
* [sound:映す_b.mp3]
