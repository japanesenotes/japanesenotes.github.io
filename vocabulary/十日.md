## Mnemonics:
七月十日はそふのめい日です。
* The tenth of July is the anniversary of my grandfather’s death.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Tenth day</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> day ten</span>. No matter how you look at this word, it makes a lot of sense.
* Words that count days use an exceptional reading. Even though this is a jukugo word, it uses kun'yomi readings for both the kanji. Think about this word this way:<br /><span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ten days</span> is just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> TOO</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とお](https://jisho.org/search/とお)</span>) long from now. Maybe less would have been okay, but ten is too much.
* 十, 日
* Ten, Sun
* [sound:十日_b.mp3]
* [sound:十日_g.mp3]
