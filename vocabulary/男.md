## Mnemonics:
知らない男と花火大会で意気投合した。
* I developed quite a rapport with a man I didn't know at a fireworks show.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. Here's a mnemonic to help you to remember it: <br />There is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> man</span>. Think of the manliest man you can. He works in an auto shop. As a child, he was an auto <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おとこ](https://jisho.org/search/おとこ)</span>), working at the auto shop from an early age. This turned him into a man very quickly. <br />Like other mnemonics that aren't lined up quite perfectly, your goal here is to get close enough to remember the true reading. Step, step, step, jump!
* 男
* Man
