## Mnemonics:
禁煙して三ヶ月になるけど、まだ時々煙草を吸いたいという衝動に駆られるね。興味深いことに、煙草が吸いたくなる時、自分ではそれをあまり自覚してないんだ。自分の人差し指を噛みしめているのに気づいて、ようやく自覚するんだよ。
* I’ve stopped smoking for three months now, but I still get the urge to smoke a cigarette every once in a while. Interestingly, when I really want to smoke, I’m not really aware of it. I only just realize it when I find myself chewing on my index finger.
* You can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> memorize</span> with your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> self</span> and your self is memorizing things. It's remembering them for later use, which means you have reached a state of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> consciousness</span> that animals cannot achieve. They just think about things, they don't memorize like you do.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 自, 覚
* Self, Memorize
* [sound:自覚_b.mp3]
* [sound:自覚_g.mp3]
