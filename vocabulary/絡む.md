## Mnemonics:
最悪！ネチャネチャの風船ガムが釣り糸に絡んじゃった！どうやって取ればいいんだろう。
* Oh no! Sticky bubblegum got tangled around my fishing line! How can I get it out?
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> entangle</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be entangled</span>. This is when something is entangled on its own (you're not directly doing the entangling). You can remember this because of the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [む](https://jisho.org/search/む)</span>, which is you saying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mo</span>ve (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [む](https://jisho.org/search/む)</span>) out of the way, I have to take care of this entanglement mess that just happened on its own.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: The entanglement mess you're fixing is a couple of kids that got their hair tangled up. They were doing some sparring in their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> からて</span> class and one thing led to the other and suddenly both their hair was entangled together.
* 絡
* Entangle

* [sound:絡む_g.mp3]
