## Mnemonics:
何度同じことを言えば分かるんだ？
* How many times do I have to say the same thing before you understand?
* If someone asks you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> what</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> occurrence</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> what</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> degrees</span> they're really trying to ask you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> how many times</span> something happened. Sometimes they're asking <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> what temperature</span> it is too.
* The reading is a combination of kun'yomi and on'yomi readings. That being said, both readings for both kanji are the readings you learned already, so you should be able to read this.
* 何, 度
* What, Degrees
* [sound:何度_b.mp3]
* [sound:何度_g.mp3]
