## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* The reading is the same as the reading you learned with the kanji... and you thought I was about to punish you because it was a single kanji vocab word. Now get over here. Time for a dirty spanking for thinking such a thing.
* 罰
* Penalty
