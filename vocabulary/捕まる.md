## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> catch</span> so the intransitive verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be caught</span>. This is a literal, physical catch. So, for example, you can catch a criminal using this verb but not catch the drift of an idea, which would be <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [捕える](https://jisho.org/search/捕える)</span>, coming up in level 27.
* The reading is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つか](https://jisho.org/search/つか)</span>, so to remember that with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be caught</span>, think about how you're a police officer trying to catch some criminals. Unfortunately, they have split up into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two ca</span>rs (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つか](https://jisho.org/search/つか)</span>) meaning you won't catch both of them, since you only have one car.
