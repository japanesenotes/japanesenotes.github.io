## Mnemonics:
ビエトだけが、コウイチが怪我や病気を治すことができる不思議な力を持っていることを知っている。
* Only Viet knows that Koichi has strange powers that can heal injuries and sicknesses.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cure</span>, so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to cure</span>. Don't get this confused with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [治る](https://jisho.org/search/治る)</span> which means to be healed. This particular verb is when you do the curing. How do you know that? Because when you try to heal them, you mess up, and then they try to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span>) you.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: I need you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to heal</span> him, and I need you to heal him right <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> now</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なお](https://jisho.org/search/なお)</span>). NOW NOW NOW! <br />This also shares the reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [直す](https://jisho.org/search/直す)</span>, a very similar word you learned previously, which means to fix. I'm guessing that the Japanese word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なお](https://jisho.org/search/なお)す</span> was only one word (to fix and to cure are pretty similar, right?). Then, there were two Chinese words for it (as you can see with the kanji), so the one Japanese word got split into two very similar words.
* 治
* Cure
* [sound:治す_b.mp3]
* [sound:治す_g.mp3]
