## Mnemonics:

* 
* When a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> passage of time</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> comes to an end</span>, you look back on it and see how well you did. Did we make more money? Did we make less? That's all <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> economics</span>, baby (that's money, baby!).
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さい](https://jisho.org/search/さい)</span> changes to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ざい](https://jisho.org/search/ざい)</span>, though, so watch out for that.
