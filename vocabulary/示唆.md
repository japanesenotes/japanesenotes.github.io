## Mnemonics:

* 
* Someone prone to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> indicate</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> instigate</span> will have lots of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suggestions</span> for other people. By dropping <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hint</span>s, they can indicate problems and instigate fights among people. Their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> implication</span>s do a lot of harm.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [示](https://jisho.org/search/示)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />Someone keeps coming up to you making <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suggestion</span>s and dropping <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hint</span>s that you should buy a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>). It happens so much that you finally decide to grab the hint-droppers arm and... oh my gosh, that's a hoof. They're a sheep!
