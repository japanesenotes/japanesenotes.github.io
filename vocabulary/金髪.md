## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Gold</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hair</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blonde</span> hair. Makes sense!
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [髪](https://jisho.org/search/髪)</span> isn't the one you learned. It's actually <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はつ](https://jisho.org/search/はつ)</span>, but it's getting rendaku'd here. So, to remember the reading of it for this word, just think about how if you were <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blonde</span>, you'd wear many <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hats</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はつ](https://jisho.org/search/はつ)</span>) to hide it. I have no idea why you'd hide it, but you can come up with a compelling reason that makes sense to you.
* 金, 髪
* Gold, Hair
