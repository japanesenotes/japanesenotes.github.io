## Mnemonics:
ステッカーの枚数については、何枚くらい注文できるかはまだはっきり分かりませんが、少なくとも百枚にはなると思います。
* I’m not exactly sure how many stickers I’m going to order yet, but I think it will be at least one hundred.
* You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flat object</span>s. You have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> number</span> of them. These flat objects are flat things, right? Flat things like sheets of paper, perhaps (or other sheets of things). So, this word is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> number of sheets</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 枚, 数
* Flat Objects Counter, Count
* [sound:枚数_b.mp3]
