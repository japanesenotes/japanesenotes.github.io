* Since I was dumped by my senpai, I've been soaking my pillow with tears.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wet</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> damp</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to wet</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to dampen</span> something.
