## Mnemonics:
どうして日本人は中国を支那と呼ぶことをやめて中国と呼び始めたんだろう。
* Why did Japanese people stop calling China Shina and start calling it Chuugoku?
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> middle</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> country</span>... who could that be? Let's think about it. Who invented kanji and therefore probably thinks they're the middle of the world? Who also is just a huge country that ruled much of Asia? That would be none other than <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> China</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just make sure you watch out for the rendaku.
* 中, 国
* Middle, Country
