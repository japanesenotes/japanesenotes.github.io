## Mnemonics:
くそ〜。パソコンが動かなくなっちゃったぜ。どうしてこうなったんだろう？！
* Shoot! My computer doesn’t work. How did this happen?!
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> move</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to move</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Someone is telling you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to move</span>. They are saying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> you go</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)ご</span>) over there. Move! Move! If it helps, have them pronounce You go more like Ugo.
