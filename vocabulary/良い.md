## Mnemonics:
良い考えだけど、実際はそれをするには資金が足りないんだよね。
* That’s a good idea, but the fact is that we don’t have enough money for it.
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> good</span>? It's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> good</span>.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: <br />A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> good</span> way to pass the time is with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>-yo (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よ](https://jisho.org/search/よ)</span>). But it better be a good yo-yo. A bad one will just fall apart.
* 良
* Good
* [sound:良い_b.mp3]
* [sound:良い_g.mp3]
