## Mnemonics:
新しいテキストフグは、今までにない最高の日本語学習教材として、歴史に残るでしょう。
* The new TextFugu will go down in history as the best Japanese learning material ever.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> remainder</span>, so the verb vocab version is to remainder. Let's make that sound better: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to remain behind</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You decide <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to remain behind</span>. Everyone else leaves, and you think you're alone. Then, someone <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> knock</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [のこ](https://jisho.org/search/のこ)</span>) on the door. Your heart jumps in your throat. They knock again.
