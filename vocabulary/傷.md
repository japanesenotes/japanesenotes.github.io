## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* To remember this reading, just think about what your mommy did for you when you were little and you got yourself a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wound</span>... she would <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kiss</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きず](https://jisho.org/search/きず)</span>) the wounds better. Of course, that never worked and was a total farce, but try to forgive mommy this one time, okay?
