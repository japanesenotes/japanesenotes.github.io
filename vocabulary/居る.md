## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alive</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be alive</span>.
* Do you know the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いる](https://jisho.org/search/いる)</span>? This is it. This is when you're referring to the existence of something alive and moving. If you've been studying Japanese up to this point (level 25) you probably already know that word. You can associate these two things together into one and remember the reading at the same time!
* 居
* Alive
* [sound:居る_b.mp3]
* [sound:居る_g.mp3]
