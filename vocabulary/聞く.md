## Mnemonics:
ねえ、聞いて、エイミー。これはあなたのせいじゃないわ。だって、ケンカしたからって、他の人と寝ていい正当な理由にはならないでしょ。
* Listen to me, Amy. This is not your fault. He is not justified in sleeping with someone else just because you two had a fight.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hear</span> so the vocab verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to hear</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to hear</span> something very important, but you can't. In order to hear, you have to take a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>) and unlock the doors covering your ears. Go ahead and imagine yourself doing that, focusing on the key.
