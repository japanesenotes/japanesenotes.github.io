## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blame</span> so this is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to blame</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> say</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せ](https://jisho.org/search/せ)</span>) I did it. I <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> say</span> you did it. Everyone is going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to blame</span> everyone, apparently!
