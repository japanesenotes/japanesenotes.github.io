## Mnemonics:

* 
* If you try to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> calculate</span> something, but instead you feel like urge to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hang</span> your teacher, you know you're doing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> multiplication</span>. It's hard, guys. Like really hard. The hardest kind of math of them all. But you can do it! No one needs to get hanged. And don't hang your head in defeat either. Multiply those numbers like a boss! Hang the numbers instead!!
* This is the kun'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [掛](https://jisho.org/search/掛)</span> and the on'yomi for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [算](https://jisho.org/search/算)</span>. And the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さん](https://jisho.org/search/さん)</span> reading is rendaku'd into <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ざん](https://jisho.org/search/ざん)</span>. This is the same for all the math-ish words (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), so try to remember that, because you'll see it again!
* 掛, 算
* Hang, Calculate
