## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> far</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> consider</span> is when you let your considerations go far from you so you don't think about how angry you are about what's going on in front of you. It allows you to have some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> restraint</span>, since your considerations are far from here. It also allows you to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> decline</span> things, since you're not considering the other person's feelings.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You've learned them both already, so you should be able to read this on your own.
* 遠, 慮
* Far, Consider
* [sound:遠慮_b.mp3]
