## Mnemonics:

* 
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> origin</span> of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dawn</span> can be found on <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> New Year's Day</span>. That's when the new sun is born and rises above the earth for a whole year until it dies. And that's the origin of dawn, children. Don't let your teachers tell you otherwise.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [元](https://jisho.org/search/元)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />Who's always there on the dawn of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> New Year's Day</span> welcoming the new sun? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Gan</span>dhi (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がん](https://jisho.org/search/がん)</span>). He sits on the edge of the earth and makes sure the sun feels welcome. What a nice guy.
