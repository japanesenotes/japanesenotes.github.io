## Mnemonics:
もし君が道路の向こう側に立つのであれば、私の秘密を君に打ち明けるよ。
* I’ll tell you my secret if you go stand on the opposite side of the road.
* You know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [向](https://jisho.org/search/向)</span> means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yonder</span>. So, think of a yonder <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span>. All you know is that he's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> over there</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> other side</span> / <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> opposite side</span> of where you are. Basically, he's just pretty <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> far away</span>, wherever he is.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Standing with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> is a cow. It is saying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> moo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [む](https://jisho.org/search/む)</span>). Weird, now <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> is saying it too. Also, if you know the reading of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [向](https://jisho.org/search/向)く</span> you should be able to read this one as well.
* 向
* Yonder
* [sound:向こう_b.mp3]
* [sound:向こう_g.mp3]
