* If you tasted the air at a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> recital</span> the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flavor</span> would taste like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scrutiny</span>. That's really what everyone is doing when they watch. They don't really want to hear you, they just want to judge you.
