## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pain</span>? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> painful</span>. It's also when you say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ow</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ouch</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eate</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)た</span>) is someone who eats. But, the eater hurt his mouth. So now it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> painful</span> to eat.
