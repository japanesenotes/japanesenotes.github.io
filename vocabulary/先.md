## Mnemonics:
申し訳ないけど、今日は先に元彼とした約束があるので、あなたとは会えません。
* I’m sorry, but I have a prior engagement with my ex-boyfriend today, so I can’t meet up with you.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />When I think about the word previous I think of the beginning of a TV show where they say previously on... Let's go with that.<br /><span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Previous</span>ly on Lost (or some other show), everyone gets stuck inside of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sack</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さき](https://jisho.org/search/さき)</span>). Imagine all the characters in the TV show writhing around inside of a sack, trying to get out.<br />You can differentiate this from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [先ず](https://jisho.org/search/先ず)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まず](https://jisho.org/search/まず)</span>) because it doesn't have a hiragana add on. It's plain. It's boring. It's just a sack (and also means the same thing as the kanji it comes from because it's a single kanji with nothing attached, which gets you to previous, which gets you to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さき](https://jisho.org/search/さき)</span>).
