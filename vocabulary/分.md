## Mnemonics:
ふぐを七分かんくすぐればどうなるかしっている？
* Do you know what a blowfish would do if you tickled it for seven minutes?
* This word has two meanings, both of which you learned with the kanji: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> minute</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> part</span>/  <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> portion</span>.
* This word is almost always attached to something, which is probably why this single kanji vocab word uses the on'yomi reading instead of the kun'yomi one. If you know the kanji reading, you know this vocab's reading as well, but the reading is different depending on the meaning:<br />If it means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> minute</span>, it's read <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふん](https://jisho.org/search/ふん)</span>.<br />If it means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> part</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> portion</span>, it's read <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶん](https://jisho.org/search/ぶん)</span>. Probably because your buns come in two parts. Ohoho.
