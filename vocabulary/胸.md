コウイチが毎朝胸を張って歌うTofuguのテーマソングの歌詞は胸にぐっときます。
* The lyrics to the Tofugu theme song, which Koichi sings every morning, with his chest puffed out, cause a swell of emotions in my own chest.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Uses the same reading as the one you learned with the kanji. At least I won't have to bring up the image of you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> moon</span>ing people with your breasts or whatnot. Oh dang, I just went and did it.
