## Mnemonics:
この小説は、読み返す度に新たな発見がある。
* Every time I reread this novel I make a new discovery.
* This is the adjective version of the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> new</span>, so it means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> new</span> too.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Your parents put a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> newly</span> wrapped present under the Christmas tree. You don't want to wait to see what new thing they got you so you rip it open to find they got you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a ra</span>w (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あら](https://jisho.org/search/あら)</span>) steak. Getting a new steak is cool and all, but a raw steak is pretty gross. It's dripping blood all over the place.
