## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rich</span> so the verb vocab version would be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be rich</span>.
* Think about the richest person you know. That person is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> To</span>m (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [む](https://jisho.org/search/む)</span>). Imagine Tom as being super rich. If you don't know a Tom, think of a famous Tom, like Tom Cruise, who definitely is pretty rich.
