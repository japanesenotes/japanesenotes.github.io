* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> appearance</span> of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fault</span> is a huge <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blunder</span> on our family. At least do not have the appearance of fault.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しつ](https://jisho.org/search/しつ)</span> gets shortened to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しっ](https://jisho.org/search/しっ)</span>, though, so make that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blunder</span>.
