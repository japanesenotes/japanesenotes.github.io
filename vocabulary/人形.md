## Mnemonics:
17歳まで、私の親友は靴下で作った腕人形だった。
* Until the age of 17, my best friend was a sock puppet.
* Something that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> person</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shape</span>d that isn't a person? That has to be some kind of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> doll</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> puppet</span>.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [人](https://jisho.org/search/人)</span> is pretty normal, though the reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [形](https://jisho.org/search/形)</span> is different from the one you learned. To remember this, think of a doll... made totally of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gyo</span>za (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎょう](https://jisho.org/search/ぎょう)</span>) dumplings. This doll is crazy (like most dolls) and it's eating itself and trying to get you to eat some of it too. Hey... why you no eat me? Mmmm. Gyoza doll.
* 人, 形
