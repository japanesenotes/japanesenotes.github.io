## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> brew</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to brew</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to distill</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.  You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to brew</span> up some beer but not the regular boring stuff. You're going to make it from the water in the hump of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> camel</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かも](https://jisho.org/search/かも)</span>). Camel beer is definitely not a horrible idea, right?
