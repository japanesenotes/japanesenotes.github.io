## Mnemonics:
ちょっと待って！財布を家に忘れたかも。
* Wait! I might have forgotten my wallet at home.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wait</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to wait</span>.
* You need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to wait</span> for your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ma</span>ma (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ま](https://jisho.org/search/ま)</span>) all the time. You want to go out? You have to wait for mama to drive you. Want to eat dinner? You have to wait for mama to make you food. Hmm. Maybe all this waiting is really a you problem.
* 待
* Wait
