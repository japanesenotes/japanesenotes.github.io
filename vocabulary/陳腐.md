## Mnemonics:

* 
* If you keep <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exhibit</span>ing the same actions and emotions and phrases eventually they're going to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rot</span> and sound <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cliched</span> to everyone. You have to mix things up once in a while. You don't want to get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stale</span>, do you?!
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. Just watch out for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span> becoming <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぷ](https://jisho.org/search/ぷ)</span>.
