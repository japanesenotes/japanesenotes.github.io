## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dangle</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to dangle</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to dangle something</span>. You're doing the dangling.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />What are you trying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to dangle</span>? You're dangling a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ta</span>co (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [た](https://jisho.org/search/た)</span>) in front of a hungry person. He just wants the taco, and you keep dangling it like that.
