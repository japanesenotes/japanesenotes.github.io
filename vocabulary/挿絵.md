## Mnemonics:

* 
* If you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> insert</span> a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> drawing</span> into a book, it becomes a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> book illustration</span>.
* The reading used for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [挿絵](https://jisho.org/search/挿絵)</span> is an exceptional one. Instead of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span> it's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さし](https://jisho.org/search/さし)</span>. When you think of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> book illustration</span>, think of an illustration of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sash</span>. Just picture after picture of a sash. Purple sashes. Green sashes. Flashy sashes. What a weird book, that only has illustrations of sashes.<br /><span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [絵](https://jisho.org/search/絵)</span>, however, is the reading you learned with the kanji, so at least you have that.
