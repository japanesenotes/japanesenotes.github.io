## Mnemonics:
夢の中で、私はお笑い芸人で、テレビでお客さんの前でオナラをしなくちゃいけなかったんだけど、うまくできなかったの。それで、その番組の司会を務めてた先輩芸人にすごく怒られたのよね。
* In my dream, I was a comedian and I had to fart on purpose in front of the TV audience, but I couldn’t do it. Then I was scolded by the experienced comedians who hosted the show.
* You know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [笑う](https://jisho.org/search/笑う)</span> is to laugh. This is a noun version of that, though it's not a laugh, (that's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [笑い](https://jisho.org/search/笑い)</span>). Add <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)</span> to that and you have the thing that makes you laugh. It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> comedy</span>. It's the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> joke</span> that's elevated with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)</span> because it made you laugh SOOOOO much. Haha!
* The reading is the same <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [笑う](https://jisho.org/search/笑う)</span> or <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [笑い](https://jisho.org/search/笑い)</span>. It's also the same as what you learned with the kanji.
* 笑
* Laugh
