## Mnemonics:
日本語を勉強することがあなたの人生で唯一の喜びだと聞いて、私達はとても嬉しく思っています。喜んでアドバイスするので、質問があればいつでも聞いてくださいね。
* We were so pleased to hear that studying Japanese is your only joy in life. We’d be happy to offer you some tips, so feel free to ask us any questions at anytime.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rejoice</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to rejoice</span>. Though <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to become happy</span> probably sounds a little more natural.
* You start <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to rejoice</span> by saying, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Yo, rock on</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よろこ](https://jisho.org/search/よろこ)</span>)! Now you know how to rejoice from now on. At church or temple? Yo, rock on! Perfect.
