## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suspicious</span>? Also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suspicious</span>!
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Our artist here at Tofugu/WaniKani/TextFugu is named <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Aya</span>. She is very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suspicious</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shady</span> looking.
