## Mnemonics:

* 
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lawn</span> of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> life</span> is just your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lawn</span>. Of course it's alive, otherwise it wouldn't be a very good lawn.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [芝](https://jisho.org/search/芝)</span> is the one you learned with the kanji. The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [生](https://jisho.org/search/生)</span> is one you haven't seen before (exception). It's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>, and you can remember it by thinking how you were such a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foo</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>) for putting all that poison on it. Now it's dying, and now it's becoming less of a lawn.
* 芝, 生
