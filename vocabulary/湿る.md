## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> damp</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be damp</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be moist</span>. Ewww.
* You have to think of something that's damp and moist. To do that, think of He-Man's girlfriend, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> She-Ma</span>n (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しめ](https://jisho.org/search/しめ)</span>). She has been hanging out in a greenhouse and is now kind of damp. He-Man hands her a towel to dry off.
