## Mnemonics:
私はアスファルトに顔面を強打した。
* I hit my face hard on the asphalt.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> face</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> face</span> is a face, but more specifically the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> face of a person</span>. Probably because the most face-like thing you can ever have is a human's face... at least in our eyes (by our I mean the human race's eyes, because I am totally with you guys on that one).
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [顔](https://jisho.org/search/顔)</span> isn't the one you learned with the kanji. But, we're going to learn that reading right now.<br />The worst thing that can happen to a face is if a face disappears. If it becomes totally <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gone</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がん](https://jisho.org/search/がん)</span>). A man that is walking up to you with no face, is a man with a gone face. Those men are men who are a part of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gone men</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がん](https://jisho.org/search/がん)めん</span>). Faces, totally gone!
* 顔, 面
* Face, Face
* [sound:顔面_b.mp3]
* [sound:顔面_g.mp3]
