## Mnemonics:
うわっ！あの駅長、今電車に唾はかなかったか？お前、見たか？
* Oh my God! Did the station master just spit on the train? Did you see that?
* This word uses <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [長](https://jisho.org/search/長)</span> in the same way as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [社長](https://jisho.org/search/社長)</span>, where it means something like boss or manager. So, this <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [長](https://jisho.org/search/長)</span> is the boss of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> station</span>, right? What do you call someone like that? You call them the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stationmaster</span> (that is, unless you want to be thrown to the trains).
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
