## Mnemonics:
会話が途切れて気まずくなった時は、とりあえず「最近、痩せた？」と言うことにしている。
* When it gets silent and awkward during conversations, I make it a rule to just say, Have you lost weight lately?
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thin</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to get thin</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />If you want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to get thin</span>, just join the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ya</span>nkees (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [や](https://jisho.org/search/や)</span>). They run their players around those four bases so much they all get thin quicker than you can throw a ball.
