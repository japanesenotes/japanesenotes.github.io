## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stretch</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be stretched</span>. You know that this is the version where you aren't doing the stretching, because you're letting someone stretch you on a torture rack in order to win a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beer</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [びる](https://jisho.org/search/びる)</span>). You're that desperate.
* The reading is the one you learned with the kanji, you lucky duck!
* 伸
* Stretch
