## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attack</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to attack</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to attack</span> me or something? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Oh so</span> scary you are. Oh so scary. Ho ho ho.
* 襲
* Attack
* [sound:襲う_b.mp3]
* [sound:襲う_g.mp3]
