## Mnemonics:

* 
* Something <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nearby</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> near</span> to you. It's very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> close</span>.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: <br />There is a restaurant <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> near</span> your house that only sells dishes with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soba</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そば](https://jisho.org/search/そば)</span>) noodles in them. They're delicious, but it's so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> close</span> to your home that you can smell them all the time. Sometimes it feels like that's all you'll ever smell anymore.
