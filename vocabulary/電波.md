## Mnemonics:
ごめん、よく聞こえないよ。ここは電波が悪いみたい。
* Sorry, you sound kind of choppy. It seems like I’ve got bad reception here.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> electricity</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wave</span> is a wave of electricity going through the air. There are many words one can use to describe this, but the easiest one is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reception</span> (aka the reception on your phone, for example). Other more technical meanings are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> radio wave</span> and electromagnetic waves. Which one you like is up to you, but reception is going to be the most common meaning on the street. Luckily people in Japan don't have AT&amp;T otherwise you'd hear this word a lot more...
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span> from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [波](https://jisho.org/search/波)</span> rendakus to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぱ](https://jisho.org/search/ぱ)</span>, so be careful. Maybe it's your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pa</span> who has bad reception every time you try to call him?
* 電, 波
* Electricity, Wave
