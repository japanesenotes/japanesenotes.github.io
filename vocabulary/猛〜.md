## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. You can put this on other words to say that it's a Fierce ____ or Energetic _____, or something along those lines. If you see this, you know that something is done fiercely or really energetically.
* The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji, probably because it's stuck onto things making it all jukugo and such.
* 猛
* Fierce
* [sound:猛〜_b.mp3]
