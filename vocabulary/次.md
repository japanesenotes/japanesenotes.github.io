## Mnemonics:
このバスツアーの次の目的地は、マイケル・ジャクソンの家です。
* The next destination on this bus tour is Michael Jackson’s house.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />Someone yells out NEXT! because the first thing didn't work on you. That was a single guillotine. Now they are going to try <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two gui</span>llotines (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つぎ](https://jisho.org/search/つぎ)</span>) and see how that works on your thick neck. NEXXXXT!
