## Mnemonics:
かなしい文をよむと、いつもなみだが二ふん二十びょうだけとまらない。
* Whenever I read a sad story I can’t stop crying for exactly two minutes and twenty seconds.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* You only had to learn one set of readings (on'yomi) for the parent kanji of this word. That means this word uses those readings as well, specifically the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ぶん</span> one when alone like this. You can remember this by thinking how whenever you're working on your writing, you get hungry and want to eat a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bun</span>.
