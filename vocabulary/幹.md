## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember: <br />When you cut the tree down to produce a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tree trunk</span>, out jumps <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Mickey</span> Mouse. WHY YOU CUT DOWN MY TREE BRO? he yells. I'm Mickey Mouse and I don't stand for this.
