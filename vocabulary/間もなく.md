## Mnemonics:
もう間もなく夕飯が出来上がる頃ですが、クッキーを食べる手が止まりません。
* Supper will be ready really soon but I still can’t stop eating these cookies.
* The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もなく](https://jisho.org/search/もなく)</span> part is like saying also don't have. So, when you also don't have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> an interval of time</span>, things will happen <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soon</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> before long</span>.
* The reading for this one is weird, though. It's a second kun'yomi reading (there is also <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あいだ](https://jisho.org/search/あいだ)</span>), read as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ま](https://jisho.org/search/ま)</span>. So what is happening <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soon</span>? Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ma</span> is going to be here before long. You better hurry and prepare, because your room looks terrible... <br /><span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [間もなく](https://jisho.org/search/間もなく)</span>, your mom is about to show up!
