## Mnemonics:
食べ物を粗末にするとバチが当たりますよ。
* When you waste food, heaven will punish you.
* An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eat</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thing</span> (aka a thing you eat) is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> food</span>. Eat those things. Eat that food. Because it's a thing you know it's a noun. Interesting how this kanji can turn a verb like this into a noun, right? Look out for it because this pattern will show up with other verbs as well!
* This word uses the kun'yomi readings for both kanji, but you know them both now, so you should be able to read this too!
* 食, 物
* Eat, Thing
* [sound:食べ物_b.mp3]
* [sound:食べ物_g.mp3]
