## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Snap all the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bowstring</span>s! Now none of the musicians can play their instruments. You're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> too ru</span>de (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つる](https://jisho.org/search/つる)</span>)! they yell, as they cry over the snapped bowstrings. They aren't wrong, that was just too rude of you.
