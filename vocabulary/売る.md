* I need to sell my car to pay the bills, but if I do that I won’t be able to get to work.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sell</span>, so the verb version of that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to sell</span>.
* You want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to sell</span> something, but what? What can you sell that will take the least amount of work? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> U</span>ni (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span>)! They're just hanging out in the ocean, ready for the taking. Go scoop some up, watch out for the pointy bits, and sell them for some quick cash!
