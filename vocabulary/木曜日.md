## Mnemonics:
木曜日に、雪だるまを作るとかかまくらを作るみたいな、何か楽しいことをしたくない？
* On Thursday, do you want to do something fun like making a snowman or building an igloo?
* This is a day of the week. You know this because it has <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [曜日](https://jisho.org/search/曜日)</span> in it. But what day of the week is it? The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tree</span> day of the week is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Thursday</span>. Tree day comes after water day (which is Wednesday, for Water-Wednesday!). Trees need water to grow, which is why the tree comes right after the water.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will help to know the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [曜日](https://jisho.org/search/曜日)</span> as well.
* 木, 曜, 日
* Tree, Weekday, Sun
