## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grate</span> and this verb means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to rub</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to scrub</span>. It will help to think back to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [擦れる](https://jisho.org/search/擦れる)</span> which means to chafe or to rub, which is more similar to this verb than the kanji meaning is.
* This kanji shares the reading from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [擦れる](https://jisho.org/search/擦れる)</span> but it also has another reading, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こする](https://jisho.org/search/こする)</span>. Both are considered common. Most likely, you'll use <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [する](https://jisho.org/search/する)</span>'s reading the most because it is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すれる](https://jisho.org/search/すれる)</span>'s reading, but for now try to keep the other one in your mind as well.
