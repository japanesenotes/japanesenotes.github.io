* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cruel</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cool</span> person is more <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cruel</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coldhearted</span> than just a normal cruel person. It's probably because they're cold all the time and it makes them mad. You should stay away from people like that.
