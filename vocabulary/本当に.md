本当にこの道であっていますか？
* Is this really the way?
* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [本当](https://jisho.org/search/本当)</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reality</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> truth</span> (level 5 vocab). If you go towards truth and reality, you are saying that it is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> really</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> truly</span> true. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [本当](https://jisho.org/search/本当)に</span>! It is!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It shares the reading with the level 5 <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [本当](https://jisho.org/search/本当)</span> as well, but just has a particle on the end to show you're going towards reality. Really!
* 本, 当
* Book, Correct
