## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> decay</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to decay</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to die out</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />The entire world would start <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to die out</span> if there were no <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coo</span>kies (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [く](https://jisho.org/search/く)</span>) left! Can you imagine your life without cookies? The trees and animals would all die too. Because they love cookies. Not just us humans.
