## Mnemonics:
あなたって本当に落ち着いているし楽しいし、あなたと遊ぶのは最高だわ。しかも、私たち言い争ったこともまだ一度も無いわよね。それってすごくない？
* You are so chill. It’s great hanging out with you. You know what? We’ve never had an argument yet, either. That’s crazy, isn’t it?
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> conflict</span> so the vocabulary means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to compete</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to argue</span>. Your views conflict with someone else's so you're going to compete with them to see who's right.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You're starting <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to compete</span> with your rival. You're yelling, and punching each other in the faces, causing a huge scene, and making people call the cops on you. Because of your quarrel, you have both now been <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> arres</span>ted (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あらそ](https://jisho.org/search/あらそ)</span>) and are now spending time in prison. This isn't the perfect reading, but it hopefully can get you to the correct reading with a few tries. Try to make the connection.
