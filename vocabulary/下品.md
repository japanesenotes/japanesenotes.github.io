## Mnemonics:
あなたの下品なメールは会社に戻ってからじっくり読ませてもらいます。
* I’ll carefully read your crude email for you when I get back to the office.
* Things that are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> below</span> normal <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> products</span> are the cheap knockoffs and bad quality items. These items are incredibly <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crude</span> in their manufacturing and design. So much <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> vulgarity</span>!
* You haven't seen this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [下](https://jisho.org/search/下)</span> yet (sorry there's so many for this kanji!). Those items are so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crude</span> that you can't even tell what they're supposed to be. Honestly they all just look like statues of lumpy <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ge</span>ckos (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [げ](https://jisho.org/search/げ)</span>). That says it's a lamp but it looks more like a gecko looking at the sky. That chair? Definitely a bunch of geckos having a pool party. Are you sure you didn't get this stuff from a weird gecko artist?
* 下, 品
* Below, Product
