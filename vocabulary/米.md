## Mnemonics:
私の一番好きな朝ごはんは、生米と味噌汁です。
* My favorite breakfast consists of uncooked rice and miso soup.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. <br />Note that this word refers to the grains of rice more than something that's a meal. If you're eating rice at a meal you'd call it <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ごはん](https://jisho.org/search/ごはん)</span>. This is like when you're talking about the rice in the fields or rice grains or something like that.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />Everyone, we have rice! <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Come</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こめ](https://jisho.org/search/こめ)</span>) and get it!
* 米
* Rice
* [sound:米_b.mp3]
* [sound:米_g.mp3]
