## Mnemonics:
大阪で雨の日に、中年のおばさんがビニール袋を被りながら自転車に乗っているのを見たことがあります。
* On a rainy day in Osaka, I saw a middle aged woman wearing a plastic bag on her head while riding a bicycle.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> incur</span> so you'd think this would mean to incur, but it doesn't. This is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to put a hat on</span>. Yep, it's the verb that's made for putting on hats. So, think of it this way. You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> incur</span> a hat when you go <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to put on a hat</span>. Pretty weird but you'll get it if you put on your thinking cap.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: The hat that you put on is none other than a hat made from a bear <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cub</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かぶ](https://jisho.org/search/かぶ)</span>). The mother bear comes for you and takes it back the hard way.
