## Mnemonics:
金玉を金色にする手術は、六ヶ月先まで予約がいっぱいです。
* The surgery to make testicles gold in color is fully booked for the next six months.
* You have some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gold</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ball</span>s. What balls are more important than any other balls, at least for a dude? That would be his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> testicles</span>. <br />This word came about because tanuki scrotum skin would be used to pound down gold into sheets. Tanuki scrotums are apparently very good at this because they are very strong and very flexible. Strange, yeah? That's why Gold balls = testicles.
* This word uses the on'yomi for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [金](https://jisho.org/search/金)</span> and the kun'yomi for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [玉](https://jisho.org/search/玉)</span>. If you know the readings of your kanji, you'll know how to read this as well.
* 金, 玉
* Gold, Ball
* [sound:金玉_b.mp3]
