## Mnemonics:
突然中指が痛くなったんだけど。
* I just had a sudden pain in my middle finger.
* The kanji and the word are almost exactly the same. The only difference is that this word can mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> finger</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> toe</span>. What are toes but small, walking fingers?
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: <br />What do you use your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> finger</span> for the most? For pointing, of course! Imagine going up to people and saying, What will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> you be</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆび](https://jisho.org/search/ゆび)</span>) when you grow up? Point your finger at the next person, What will you be? Keep going until you're just saying, You be? You be? with your finger out.
* 指
* Finger
* [sound:指_b.mp3]
