## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Someone</span> who <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> float</span>s and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wander</span>s from place to place is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> vagrant</span>. They don't really have a home, but they keep hanging around yours. It's kind of annoying. (This word has a negative connotation, you wouldn't use it for someone who is just homeless, unless you're really mean.)
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [浮](https://jisho.org/search/浮)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />All the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> vagrant</span>s you know are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foo</span>ls (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>). They just left their homes and now they float around your city for no reason. You ask them why and they shrug. You've never seen a better definition of a fool before in your life!
* 浮, 浪, 者
* Float, Wander, Someone
