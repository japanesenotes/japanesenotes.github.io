## Mnemonics:
このお守りを肌身離さず身に着けると約束してくれないか？
* Could you promise me that you will wear this good luck charm all the time, please?
* Another verb for this kanji! Crazy! I know, I'm sorry. The previous ones were: <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [着る](https://jisho.org/search/着る)</span> (to wear), <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [着く](https://jisho.org/search/着く)</span> (to arrive), and now <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [着ける](https://jisho.org/search/着ける)</span> (to put on / to wear). At least it's similar to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [着る](https://jisho.org/search/着る)</span>, right? In this case, this word is like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [付ける](https://jisho.org/search/付ける)</span>, which means to attach. Think about how you're attaching your clothes to your body (and putting them on). That's why this is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to put on</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to wear</span>. Same sound, different kanji, similar ideas.
* The reading is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [着く](https://jisho.org/search/着く)</span>'s reading, but it might be easier to think it shares a reading with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [付ける](https://jisho.org/search/付ける)</span>, which has a similar meaning. Put on clothes, attach on clothes, etc!
* 着
* Wear
* [sound:着ける_b.mp3]
* [sound:着ける_g.mp3]
