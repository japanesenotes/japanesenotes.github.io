* 
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ancestor</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mother</span> isn't your mother, it's the mother before your mother, your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grandmother</span>.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [祖](https://jisho.org/search/祖)</span> is known to you, but the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [母](https://jisho.org/search/母)</span> part is not. To remember the on'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [母](https://jisho.org/search/母)</span> in <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [祖](https://jisho.org/search/祖)母</span>, just think about how your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grandmother</span> had a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bo</span>at (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼ](https://jisho.org/search/ぼ)</span>), even if she didn't... and what an amazing boat it was. If you want, you can imagine your grandma is a boat too, but that might not be very nice.
