* You know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [込む](https://jisho.org/search/込む)</span> is to be crowded. This, however, is when you make something crowded. How do you make something crowded? You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to include</span> more and more things into the thing you want crowded until it is crowded. To do this act (which you are doing), you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mail</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [める](https://jisho.org/search/める)</span>) things in over and over again. This will crowd the post office if I include all this mail in this mail box! Ha ha! What a rebel!
* The reading comes from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [込む](https://jisho.org/search/込む)</span>. No reading too crowded to include here.
