## Mnemonics:
うん、ローソンは確かに二十四時間営業だよ。でもさぁ、あのー、多分弓と矢は置いてないと思うよ？
* Yeah, Lawson is open 24/7, but, you know, I don’t think they carry bows and arrows.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You have your bow and you use it to shoot things, sure, but you've also covered it in candy so you can eat it when you're waiting out in the woods waiting for a buck to come by. You lick your candy bow and say: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yummy</span>! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆみ](https://jisho.org/search/ゆみ)</span>). Imagine the taste of your bow. What taste would make you say yummy?
* 弓
* Bow
* [sound:弓_b.mp3]
* [sound:弓_g.mp3]
