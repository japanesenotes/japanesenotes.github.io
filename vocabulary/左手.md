## Mnemonics:
左手に、でんきゅうのタトゥーをほった。
* I got a light bulb tattoo on my left hand.
* The kanji for left and the kanji for hand. Put them together and you have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> left hand</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. This word, however, uses the kun'yomi readings, combined. This is possibly because of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [手](https://jisho.org/search/手)</span>, which is a body part. When a body part is present in a word, oftentimes it gets changed over to kun'yomi reading for who knows what reason. Either way, both kanji use the reading you learned in this word, so you should already know it.
* 左, 手
* Left, Hand
* [sound:左手_b.mp3]
* [sound:左手_g.mp3]
