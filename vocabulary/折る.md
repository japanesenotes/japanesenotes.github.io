* When I was folding the paper I got a paper cut.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fold</span> so the vocab verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to fold</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fold</span> your arm in half. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> OH!</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)</span>) you cry.
