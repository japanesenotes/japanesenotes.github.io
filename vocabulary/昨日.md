## Mnemonics:
昨日は、大学の課題で、沢山の叙事詩を読まなくてはいけませんでした。
* We had to read many epic poems yesterday for a university assignment.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yesterday</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> day</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yesterday</span>. What a blast from the past!
* Oof. The reading for this word makes no sense. You'll have to forget everything you've learned about the readings of the kanji and just go straight up mnemonic for the word on its own. Okay. Think about what you did yesterday, all day. You played <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> keno</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きのう](https://jisho.org/search/きのう)</span>), gambling away your grandmother's money. Yesterday was the worst day ever because you lost everything playing Keno. Today is different, not like yesterday, right?
* 昨, 日
* Previous, Sun
* [sound:昨日_b.mp3]
* [sound:昨日_g.mp3]
