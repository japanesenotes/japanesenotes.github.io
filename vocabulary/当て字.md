## Mnemonics:
時々、漢字は、亜米利加 (アメリカ)のようにそれぞれの意味を無視して、読み方だけで選ばれます。これらの漢字を当て字と言います。
* Sometimes kanji are selected solely for their sounds and the meaning is ignored as in 亜米利加 (アメリカ). These are called phonetic kanji.
* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [当て](https://jisho.org/search/当て)</span> means something like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to guess correctly</span>. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [字](https://jisho.org/search/字)</span> means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> letter</span>. So, this is a letter you guessed correctly. This refers to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> phonetic kanji</span>, which are kanji that are used in words simply for their sounds, not for their meanings. They are there to be phonetic, and that is all. That is why this word refers to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> phonetic kanji</span>.
* The readings are the on'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [字](https://jisho.org/search/字)</span> and the kun'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [当て](https://jisho.org/search/当て)</span>. You've seen <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [当て](https://jisho.org/search/当て)る</span> in the past, though, so you should be able to read this portion as well. Combine the two together and you have yourself a nice reading.
