俺の老眼鏡が見当たらないんだ。
* I can’t find my reading glasses.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. It's made up of the kanji for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> see</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> right</span>, so what happens when you see the right thing? You manage <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to come upon</span> what you're looking for or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be found</span>, if you're the one who's lost and you see the right people that are looking for you.<br />Note: This verb is almost always used in the negative form. It is very, very rare for it to be positive. So when you're using it, make sure no one found the thing you're talking about!
* The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You've learned both of these readings by now so you should be able to read this on your own.
* 見, 当
* See, Correct
* [sound:見当たる_b.mp3]
