あんたが私にアイスクリームをくれるなんて、本当に信じられないよ。あんたがそんなに優しいなんて今まで気付かなかったわ！
* I can’t believe you gave me your ice cream. I didn’t realize that you were so kind until now.
* When you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attach</span> your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> energy</span> (imagine someone suddenly looking up at something, attaching their energy to it), they have noticed or realized something. That's why this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to realize</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to notice</span>. <br />Don't confuse this with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [気を付けて]([気](https://jisho.org/search/気)を付けて)</span> which is similar in that it has all the same kanji. It's just used a little different. Try to remember the difference before moving on.
* The readings come from the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [気](https://jisho.org/search/気)</span> kanji (which you know) and the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [付く](https://jisho.org/search/付く)</span> which you should know by now. Combine these together and you have the ability to read this word. Take note that the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [付く](https://jisho.org/search/付く)</span> part is rendaku'd, though, so it is a tiny bit different.
* 気, 付
* Energy, Attach
* [sound:気付く_b.mp3]
* [sound:気付く_g.mp3]
