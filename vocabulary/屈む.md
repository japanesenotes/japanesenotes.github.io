## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yield</span>, and when you do that to someone else you tend <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to lean over</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to bow</span> to show them respect.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Who do you need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to stoop</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to bow</span> before? Takeshi <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kaga</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かが](https://jisho.org/search/かが)</span>), that's <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miOLle5M42o>Chairman Kaga</a> to you! Before you can start cooking for him in Iron Chef, you must bow! Otherwise you'll be disqualified for being rude.
