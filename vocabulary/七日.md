## Mnemonics:
たった七日でかいしゃをやめた。
* I left the company after only seven days.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Seventh day</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> day seven</span>. No matter how you look at this word, it makes a lot of sense.
* Words that count days use an exceptional reading. Even though this is a jukugo word, it uses kun'yomi readings for both the kanji. Think about this word this way:<br />You've been stuck inside working for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seven days</span> and today you finally have a day off. Your friend asks you if you want to go for a drive but you say, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Nah, no car</span> today (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なのか](https://jisho.org/search/なのか)</span>), because you've been cooped up long enough. Seven days is too long to be inside.
* 七, 日
* Seven, Sun
* [sound:七日_b.mp3]
* [sound:七日_g.mp3]
