## Mnemonics:
こんなに早口の赤ん坊なんて見たことないよ。
* I’ve never seen such a fast talking baby before.
* When you have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fast</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mouth</span>, you're probably a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fast talker</span>, right motormouth?
* Remember how body parts often change even jukugo words to kun'yomi readings? That's what happened here too. Both readings are kun'yomi, making this one <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> はやくち</span>. Alternatively, you can read this as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はやぐち](https://jisho.org/search/はやぐち)</span> as well.
* 早, 口
* Early, Mouth
* [sound:早口_b.mp3]
* [sound:早口_g.mp3]
