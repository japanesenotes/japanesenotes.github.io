## Mnemonics:
どうしてコウイチのデスクの引き出しには乾いたご飯の塊が入っているの？
* Why is there a big ball of dried-up, cooked rice in Koichi's desk drawer?
* The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ご](https://jisho.org/search/ご)</span> just makes this word more polite and fancy. When it comes to food, it's nice to be those things. This has the same meaning as the kanji (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> meal</span>) making it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> meal</span>, but it also refers to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cooked rice</span> as well. So, Come eat your <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ご](https://jisho.org/search/ご)飯</span> can be both come eat your rice and come eat your meal. Really, since most Japanese meals come with rice, though, you can see how the overlap happens.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Now how about you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> han</span>d me another bowl of rice?
* 飯
* Meal
* [sound:ご飯_b.mp3]
* [sound:ご飯_g.mp3]
