## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> turtle shell</span> that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> patterned</span> has much more <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> effect</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> result</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> worth</span> than a non-patterned turtle shell.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [甲](https://jisho.org/search/甲)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />If you want to know how much you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> worth</span>, just take a look at your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>). Cars are the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> result</span> of money and hard work. So basically, they say how much you're worth!
