## Mnemonics:
大事な用事があるので、明日は出勤することができません。
* I have an important matter to attend to so I will not be able to work tomorrow.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> task</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> action</span> is something you have to do (because <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [事](https://jisho.org/search/事)</span> is all about actions). What's another way to say an action that is a task, though? I would say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> errand</span> or even <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> business</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 用, 事
* Task, Action
* [sound:用事_b.mp3]
* [sound:用事_g.mp3]
