## Mnemonics:
あのベストセラー作家の趣味はサッカーだ。
* That best-selling author’s hobby is playing soccer.
* This is a strange one, but only at first glance. You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> make</span> a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> house</span>. You'd think this would mean something like building a house or construction or something. Instead, it means author. Think of it this way: An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> author</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> makes</span> (writes and creates works) in their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> home</span>. Authors don't make their word magic in a corporate office!
* The readings are on'yomi readings, though <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さく](https://jisho.org/search/さく)</span> from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [作](https://jisho.org/search/作)</span> gets shortened to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さっ](https://jisho.org/search/さっ)</span>. Just be sure to remember that and you should be able to read this word just fine.
* 作, 家
* Make, House
* [sound:作家_b.mp3]
