## Mnemonics:
喉頭炎で息をしたり、水を飲んだりするのさえ苦しい。
* Because of my laryngeal inflammation, it's painful for me to even breathe or drink water.
* The body part that lives between your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> throat</span> and your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> head</span> is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> larynx</span>. Otherwise known as the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> voice box</span>, because your vocal cords live in there.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [頭](https://jisho.org/search/頭)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />If you really want to get a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> larynx</span> work out, go to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> とうきょう</span>. It's loud, it's crowded, and you have to yell the entire time to get people to hear what you have to say. You also know 18 levels of kanji and you really want to shout them all out, which makes your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> voice box</span> tired (but makes you happy).
* 喉, 頭
* Throat, Head
* [sound:喉頭_b.mp3]
* [sound:喉頭_g.mp3]
