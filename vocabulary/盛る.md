## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> heaps</span>, so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to heap up</span>. It can also mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to serve food</span>, as in you're heaping on food onto someone's plate.
* Please keep heaping up the food. I want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> more</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もる](https://jisho.org/search/もる)</span>), more, more.
* 盛
* Pile
