## Mnemonics:
家具はあなたの家にお運びしましたが、もう少し腰を軽くして扉と窓を早く取り付ける方がいいのではないかと思います。
* We moved the furniture to your new house but you should act quickly to get the doors and windows installed.
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> house</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tools</span> aren't the tools you use to build a house. They're more like the things that are a part of your house that you use like tools. Those things would be your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> furniture</span>. So, remember, your house tools are just furniture.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 家, 具
* House, Tool
