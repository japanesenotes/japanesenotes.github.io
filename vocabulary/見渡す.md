## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb.  The kanji mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> see</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> transit</span>, but the vocab isn't quite the same. You are going to transit your eyes over an area to take in what you see. So you're really going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to look out over</span> everything. This word is usually used when you're looking at landscapes or a really large area.
* The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You've learned both of these readings by now so you should be able to read this on your own.
* 見, 渡
* See, Transit
* [sound:見渡す_b.mp3]
* [sound:見渡す_g.mp3]
