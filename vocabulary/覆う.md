The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cover</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to cover</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to hide</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You decide <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to cover</span> yourself with a sheet because you want to pretend to be a ghost. But covering yourself isn't enough. If you really want people to believe in your disguise you have to say, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> おお</span>! Otherwise they'll think you're a covered chair or a bush. If you <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おお](https://jisho.org/search/おお)</span> at them they'll definitely know you're a ghost covered in that sheet.
