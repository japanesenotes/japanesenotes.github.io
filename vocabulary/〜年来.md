## Mnemonics:
数年来彼女をデートに誘っているんだが、いつも「髪の毛を洗うのに忙しいから」と断られる。
* I’ve been trying to ask her out for a few years now, but she always says she will be busy washing her hair.
* When you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> year</span>s <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> com</span>ing and going, you know it is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> for some years</span>. Don't confuse this one with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [来年]([来](https://jisho.org/search/来)年)</span> which means next year. The kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [来](https://jisho.org/search/来)</span> comes after the kanji for year, so instead of coming year it's years that come (and go). At least, you can think of it that way to differentiate. <br />You can also add numbers to this word. For example <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [５年来](https://jisho.org/search/５年来)</span> means something to the tune of for five years. But this is a pretty formal word. Just keep that in mind.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 年, 来
* Year, Come
* [sound:〜年来_b.mp3]
* [sound:〜年来_g.mp3]
