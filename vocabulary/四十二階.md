引っ越しって、色々事務手続きがあって結構面倒くさい上に、対応の悪い担当者とかもいたりするよね。でも、今回の引っ越しで最悪だったのは、引っ越しの日にエレベーターが故障中だったことだよ。俺の部屋、四十二階なのに。
* It’s pretty annoying that there’s a lot of bureaucratic red tape involved in moving, and to make matters worse, sometimes the person in charge has an attitude problem. However, the worst part of my moving this time was that the elevator was out of service when I moved in and my apartment was on the forty-second floor.
* You know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [四十二](https://jisho.org/search/四十二)</span> means forty two. So, as long as you know <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> floor</span> you'll know this means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> forty-second floor</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
