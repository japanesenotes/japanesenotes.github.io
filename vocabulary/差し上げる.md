## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a really polite way to say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to give</span>, probably because you're lowering yourself down and raising the item above your head so far that you have to point at it because if you were touching it you'd be defiling it anyways so, you know, point at it and raise it way up, you little worm on the ground.
* The reading is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [差す](https://jisho.org/search/差す)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [上げる](https://jisho.org/search/上げる)</span> put together, both hopefully words you know okay by now.
* 差, 上
* Distinction, Above
* [sound:差し上げる_b.mp3]
* [sound:差し上げる_g.mp3]
