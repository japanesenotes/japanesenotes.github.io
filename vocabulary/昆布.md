## Mnemonics:
「よくも私に対して昆布を投げつけてくれたわね。」「ごめん。そんな大ごとだとは思わなかったんだよ。」
* How dare you throw konbu seaweed at me! I’m sorry. I didn’t think it would be that big of a deal.
* This one is pretty weird. The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cloth</span> of our <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> descendants</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> konbu</span>. This is a type of seaweed that is very common in Japan. It is used in foods and in broths. It is everywhere, and delicious. If you're not familiar with it already this may be a hard word to learn, but I believe in you. Maybe if you read up on konbu for a bit it will help you to remember your descendants' cloth.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [布](https://jisho.org/search/布)</span> part gets changed to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶ](https://jisho.org/search/ぶ)</span>, probably because if a food doesn't have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> konbu</span> you say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶ](https://jisho.org/search/ぶ)</span>).
* 昆, 布
