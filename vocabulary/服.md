## Mnemonics:
今日はチョー暑くて、あなたはあまりにも多くの服を着ているよ。
* It’s so hot today. You’re wearing too many clothes.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* The reading is the reading you learned with the kanji and uses the on'yomi even though it's a single word. Very strange, but convenient for you so long as you remember this exception reading word.
* 服
* Clothes
* [sound:服_b.mp3]
