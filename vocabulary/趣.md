## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Oh my goodness. The reading of this word! Try to think of it as your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thought</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [思](https://jisho.org/search/思)</span>) <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cow</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [む](https://jisho.org/search/む)</span>) <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>). In your thoughts, you think of the cow key, which will unlock the door in front of you... at least that's what you think it is... you're not sure. But, you're pretty sure it's the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gist</span> of how you get inside the door. Is it?
