## Mnemonics:

* 
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> morning</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> edition</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> morning edition</span>.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You may have seen this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [朝](https://jisho.org/search/朝)</span> before, but here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You pick up your copy of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> morning edition</span> and Mrs. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chou</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょう](https://jisho.org/search/ちょう)</span>) is on the front cover. Oh no, what has she done now? Before you can find out, the morning edition is ripped from your hands. You look up and see Mrs. Chou running away, cackling, with other copies stuffed into her arms.
* 朝, 刊
* Morning, Edition
