## Mnemonics:

* 
* I <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> request</span> and then I <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> request</span> again. So many requests, but nobody will listen to me. My last hope is to get a bunch of people who have the same ideas together and make a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> petition</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
