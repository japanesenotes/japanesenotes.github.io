これでコウイチは一流社会の仲間入りだ。たくさんのセレブに会ったり、シャンパンパーティにもすぐ行き始めるだろう。
* Koichi is now a member of the upperclass. He will meet a bunch of celebrities and start going to champagne parties soon.
* This is a weird one. You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> one</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stream</span>. This is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> first rate</span> stream material we have here, though. If you think about it, if you only have one stream (instead of a ton of streams), you can put all your effort and energy into it. When you do that, you're making sure it is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> first rate</span> stream in terms of quality and anything else.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 一, 流
* One, Stream
