## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is the adverb version of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [再](https://jisho.org/search/再)</span>, so it shares the meaning <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> again</span> and also has the meaning <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> once again</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Once again</span>, you put a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> footer</span> in your note because you can't remember the reading to this word because the mnemonic is so bad (sorry!).
* 再
* Again
* [sound:再び_b.mp3]
* [sound:再び_g.mp3]
