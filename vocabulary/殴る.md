* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> assault</span>. What are some ways to assault a person? How about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to punch</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to strike</span>, or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to hit</span>, to name a few?
* Someone is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nag</span>ging (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なぐ](https://jisho.org/search/なぐ)</span>) you and nagging you about something. You can't take it any more, so you turn around <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to punch</span> them in the face.
