やばい、超絶に可愛い真っ黒なワンピース見つけちゃったんだけど。
* OMG, I just came across the cutest pitch black dress.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reality</span> is that it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> black</span>. Like, so black that it's beyond fake black, it's reality black. This is so black it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pitch black</span>.
* The reading for the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [真](https://jisho.org/search/真)</span> is the vocab kun'yomi reading. Think of what is pitch black. It's your poor <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ma</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ま](https://jisho.org/search/ま)</span>). She is so dark that she sucks in light, like a black hole... wait, she is a black hole, it explains why your Ma is pitch black.
* 真, 黒
* Reality, Black
