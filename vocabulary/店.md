## Mnemonics:
この店のこと絶対気に入るぜ。世界一うまいミートローフがあるんだよ。
* You’re going to love this shop. They have the best meatloaf in the world.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />Think of your favorite <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shop</span>. Okay, now imagine yourself going to it. When you arrive, the entire shop is totally <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> missi</span>ng (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みせ](https://jisho.org/search/みせ)</span>). Feel the shock and awe of this. It's as if it picked up and left overnight. No building, no anything. Just missing.
