## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is the noun version of the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mistake</span>, so it means a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mistake</span> or if it's on a computer, an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> error</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />When you make a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mistake</span>, you need to admit to it. When someone asks, Who's responsible for this mistake? You say, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> I am</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あやま](https://jisho.org/search/あやま)</span>).
