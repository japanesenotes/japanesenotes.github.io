* Why did you just send that weird looking selfie taken in front of the station to me?
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> station</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> front</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> front of station</span>. This word is great for telling people where you want to meet, by the way.
* This is like two separate words put together into one, so you can imagine it's the kun'yomi readings. You learned the right reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [駅](https://jisho.org/search/駅)</span> in the kanji, and you should know the vocab word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [前](https://jisho.org/search/前)</span> by now. Combine the two together and you have yourself <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> front of station</span>.
