## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> decrease</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to decrease</span>. You can differentiate this from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [減る](https://jisho.org/search/減る)</span> because with this one, you are the one that is going to be doing the decreasing. The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rush</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [らす](https://jisho.org/search/らす)</span>) of decreasing something fills your veins.
* The reading is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [減る](https://jisho.org/search/減る)</span>, so if you know that reading you should know this one.
* 減
* Decrease
* [sound:減らす_b.mp3]
