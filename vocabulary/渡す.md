## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> transit</span>, but the vocab isn't quite the same. You are transiting one object over to another person (the word is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to hand over</span>), though, so it kind of makes sense. You see the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span>? You're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> su</span>ing somebody, so you hand over the papers telling them you're suing them. Don't confuse this with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [渡る](https://jisho.org/search/渡る)</span> which is to cross over. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span> is sue.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
* 渡
* Transit
* [sound:渡す_b.mp3]
* [sound:渡す_g.mp3]
