## Mnemonics:

* 
* This one is a little bit off and will take a little extra remembering. The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> extinction</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> die out</span>, but the verb version here is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to sever</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to cut off</span>. The ideas are pretty similar, but the wording isn't the same. Just think, when you put something to extinction, you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to cut off</span> that thing from your life. Put it in extinction. You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to sever</span> it.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />In terms of things you need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to sever</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ta</span>cos (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [た](https://jisho.org/search/た)</span>) are #1 on your list. No more tacos for you, going to cut those off from my diet.
