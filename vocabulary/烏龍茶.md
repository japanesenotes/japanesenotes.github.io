## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Imperial</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tea</span> the color of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crow</span>'s feathers can only be the famous, delicious <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Oolong tea</span>. It came from the imperial people of China to Japan (probably) and there are lots of different variants. But the leaves are all that blackish/grey crow feather color.
* This word takes the on'yomi readings except for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [龍](https://jisho.org/search/龍)</span> which is an exception (sorry). You haven't learned the on'yomi for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [烏](https://jisho.org/search/烏)</span> yet either, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />Who loves <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Oolong tea</span> more than anyone else? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Oooo Ron</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うーろん](https://jisho.org/search/うーろん)</span>) Weasley from Harry Potter. He's British, so of course you'd think he loves tea, but Oolong is his jam. Just picture him and think, oooooh it's Ron, when you drink this kind of tea.<br />And make sure you remember that, because this is also a written in katakana when the kanji isn't used, to type out the long mark <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ー](https://jisho.org/search/ー)</span> when you enter your answer.
