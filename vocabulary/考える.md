## Mnemonics:
私の娘は、もしタイタニック号が沈まなければ、みんなその代わりにディズニーランドに行くことができて、もっといい映画になったのにと考える。
* My daughter thinks that the movie Titanic would have been better if the ship never sank and everyone went to Disney World instead.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> think</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to think about</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to consider</span>. <br />Note that this isn't the to think that is like I think that he is a power ranger. No, this is more like the actual thinking action. That's why this word is to think about or to consider rather than plain old to think which is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [思う](https://jisho.org/search/思う)</span>.
* If you want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to think</span>, the best way to do so is to do the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> conga</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かんが](https://jisho.org/search/かんが)</span>). Imagine yourself doing the conga and thinking away. You're so inspired! The thoughts are flowing as freely as your sweet, slow dance moves.
