* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> past</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shape</span> is how things were in the past. To describe those things (like you would with an adjective, aka <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [形容詞](https://jisho.org/search/形容詞)</span>), you'd use <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> past tense</span>.
