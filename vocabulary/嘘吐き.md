## Mnemonics:
その時代、嘘吐きは全員燃やされていた。
* In that era, all liars were to be burned.
* If <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lies</span> puke (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [吐く]([吐](https://jisho.org/search/吐)く)</span>) out of your mouth, you're a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> liar</span>.
* This is a combination of the kun'yomi readings, one of which you haven't seen yet. You'll see this word without the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [吐](https://jisho.org/search/吐)</span> kanji too, but for now let's learn its kanji reading! <br />You can't just tell one <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lie</span>, it always turns into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>). Kind of like a chip or pretzel, you can't just have one. With lies, you have to open your mouth for two more. And then two more.... and... well you get it.
* 嘘, 吐
* Lie, Throw Up
