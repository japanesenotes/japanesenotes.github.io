## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> urge</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to urge</span>.
* Someone with a weird accent is trying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to urge</span> you to eat Unagah (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)なが</span>). This person really means unagi, and this person also doesn't realize how delicious unagi is (and thinks he's tricking you). You ask him what Unagah is. Go ahead and say it out loud.
