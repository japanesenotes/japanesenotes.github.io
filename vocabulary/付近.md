## Mnemonics:

* Is there a public restroom in this neighborhood?
* If you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attach</span> things <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> near</span> you, they end up being in the same <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neighborhood</span> as you. They're attached <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nearby</span> so they can't go much further. 
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [付](https://jisho.org/search/付)</span> though, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neighborhood</span> is full of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foo</span>ls (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>). Fools everywhere. You're probably one too, since you live <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nearby</span>.
