まあ、偶然！今丁度あなたに電話をしようと思っていたところよ！
* What a coincidence! I was just about to call you!
* Okay, we're going to cheat a little bit to remember the meaning of this word. Let's say you take the temperature of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> street</span>. It is exactly one hundred <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> degree</span>s. That's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exactly</span> what it is. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Just</span> 100 degrees, not one degree more or less. You put your eggs on the street and watch them cook.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.

* Street, Degrees
