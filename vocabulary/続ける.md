## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [続く](https://jisho.org/search/続く)</span> except for now you're the one doing the continuing. Unfortunately, there's no good way to differentiate the two continues using just the meaning, but you can think of it this way: With <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ける](https://jisho.org/search/ける)</span>, you really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> care</span> about continuing this thing so you are continuing it (doing the action of continuing). With <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [く](https://jisho.org/search/く)</span> you're just like that's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coo'</span> if it continues, but I don't really care...
* The reading is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [続く](https://jisho.org/search/続く)</span>, so be sure to know that so you can know this.
* 続
* Continue
* [sound:続ける_b.mp3]
* [sound:続ける_g.mp3]
