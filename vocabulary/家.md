## Mnemonics:
家とは、みんなの心と食べ物がある場所です。
* Home is where the heart is. And the food.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />You visit your friend's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> home</span>. However, this home isn't any normal home. They live at the video game company <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> EA</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いえ](https://jisho.org/search/いえ)</span>). Imagine yourself going to your friend's home from school every day. You go to EA, settle in, and play some video games. What a great home that would be to visit.<br />There's another reading as well, though, and it's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うち](https://jisho.org/search/うち)</span>. This reading is used for your own home. For someone else's home you'd use <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いえ](https://jisho.org/search/いえ)</span>, though.
* 家
* House
