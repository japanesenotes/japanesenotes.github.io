## Mnemonics:
りょうしんはこどもを中にしてすわっていた。
* The parents were sitting with their child between them.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:<br />Something is coming from the middle of the wall. It sounds like a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> knock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なか](https://jisho.org/search/なか)</span>), knock, knock noise. You break down the wall, and sure enough there's some creepy dude standing inside. He is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> knocker</span>.
