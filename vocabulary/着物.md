## Mnemonics:
母親に、既婚女性か未婚女性かで着物の種類が異なると教えてもらいました。
* My mom told me that married women and unmarried women wear different kimonos.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thing</span>s you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wear</span> are your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clothes</span>. Oh, and Japanese clothes count too. We're talking <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kimono</span>s. Way back when, these could just be called <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clothes</span> because it's all people really wore, but nowadays we know they're specific to the stereotypical kimono you think of when you think Japan.
* The reading is a bit strange using kun'yomi readings. Luckily, we taught you these already, so go put on that kimono of yours and relax at the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [温泉](https://jisho.org/search/温泉)</span> for a bit.
* 着, 物
* Wear, Thing
