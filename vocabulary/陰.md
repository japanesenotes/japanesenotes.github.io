## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shadow</span>.
* Look at a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shadow</span>. It's long, surprisingly long. It's in the shape of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cage</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かげ](https://jisho.org/search/かげ)</span>), because that's what is producing the long shadow. Check out each bar of the cage. Maybe you're inside the cage? Whatever is going on, a long shadow is being created by the cage and shade.
