## Mnemonics:
うーん。折角イメチェンするいい機会だし、後ろ髪を三十センチくらい切ってもらおうかな。
* Well, it’s a good opportunity to make a long-awaited change to my look, so I might as well get it shortened in the back by about 30 centimeters.
* When you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fold</span> things at all sorts of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> angles</span> you have quite a mess. It's not easy going through life with all these folds and angles. That's why this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> with trouble</span> because you certainly aren't traversing along a nice and flat piece of space-time, are you? Nah, it's all angled and folded :(
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Watch out for the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せつ](https://jisho.org/search/せつ)</span> changing to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せっ](https://jisho.org/search/せっ)</span>, though. Another thing you have to go through <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> with trouble</span>, I'm afraid.
* 折, 角
* Fold, Angle
* [sound:折角_b.mp3]
* [sound:折角_g.mp3]
