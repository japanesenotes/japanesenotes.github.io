## Mnemonics:
このダウンジャケットは、寒さをとってもよく防いでくれますよ。
* This down jacket will really protect you from the cold.
* You're doing a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prevent</span>ion. When you prevent something, what are you really doing? You're trying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to defend</span> against something from happening. That's why this verb is a little weird and means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to defend</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to protect against</span>. It can also be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to prevent</span>, too, but just make sure you're thinking of it more like you're defending something with your prevention.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to defend</span> yourself? You should probably put out that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fuse</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふせ](https://jisho.org/search/ふせ)</span>) attached to that giant bomb first then.
* 防
* Prevent
* [sound:防ぐ_b.mp3]
* [sound:防ぐ_g.mp3]
