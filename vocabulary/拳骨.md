## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fist</span> that's like a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bone</span> (hard) is a fist that's clenched and ready to punch, making this a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clenched fist</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> knuckles</span>, if you want to get even bonier about it.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. But <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [拳](https://jisho.org/search/拳)</span> doesn't use the one you learned, it uses <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [げん](https://jisho.org/search/げん)</span> instead. Just imagine someone clenching their fist at you. You gulp and say <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [げん](https://jisho.org/search/げん)</span> instead of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けん](https://jisho.org/search/けん)</span> out of fear.
* 拳, 骨
* Fist, Bone
* [sound:拳骨_b.mp3]
