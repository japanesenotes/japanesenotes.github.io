## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> The next</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> morning</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> the next morning</span>.
* The reading can be what you've learned with the kanji, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よくあさ](https://jisho.org/search/よくあさ)</span>, or it can be the on'yomi reading across the board, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よくちょう](https://jisho.org/search/よくちょう)</span>. Both are good to remember because <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よくちょう](https://jisho.org/search/よくちょう)</span> is more formal (you'll use that reading in writing more often) and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よくあさ](https://jisho.org/search/よくあさ)</span> is more informal - you'll use that in speaking more often.
* 翌, 朝
