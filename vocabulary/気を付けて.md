## Mnemonics:
これから雪を食べる時はもっと気を付けてよ。色盲だから、色が黄色でも分かんないんだから。
* You need to be more careful when you eat snow from now on. You're color blind, so you can’t tell even if it is yellow.
* This word contains the words <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [気](https://jisho.org/search/気)</span> (energy) and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [付ける](https://jisho.org/search/付ける)</span> (to attach). So, when you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attach</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> energy</span> to something you're focusing in on it, right? This word is a sort of order as well, since it's te-form there at the end. It's a set phrase people say to other people who are doing dangerous things. It's kind of like saying Attach energy to what you're doing! Stay focused! A simpler way to translate this would be to say this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> be careful</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> take care</span>, though. Learn this word so that you can always show that you're caring for your friends!
* The readings come from the two words <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [気](https://jisho.org/search/気)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [付ける](https://jisho.org/search/付ける)</span>. So long as you know those from the previous levels, you should be able to read this one as well.
* 気, 付
* Energy, Attach
