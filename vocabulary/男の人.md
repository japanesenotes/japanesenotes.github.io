## Mnemonics:
背の高い男の人はTシャツを着ていて、背の低い男の人はセーターを着ています。
* The tall guy is wearing a T-shirt and the short guy is wearing a sweater.
* The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [の](https://jisho.org/search/の)</span> particle makes it so the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [人](https://jisho.org/search/人)</span> belongs to the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [男](https://jisho.org/search/男)</span>. Basically, this literally means a man person or a person of man. It's a more polite way to say plain old <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> man</span>, though, so all you have to remember is that.
* This word is actually two separate words combined with a particle. So, since you treat them like separate words, you read each of them with the kun'yomi readings (they are both single kanji words all alone). That being said, in level 4 you learn about the vocab readings for these separate words, so use that knowledge to remember the reading for this word as well.
* 男, 人
* Man, Person
* [sound:男の人_b.mp3]
* [sound:男の人_g.mp3]
