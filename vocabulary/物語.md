今物語を書いているんです。悲しい子犬フェチの男の話です。
* I’m writing a story right now. It’s about a sad guy who is obsessed with puppies.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> language</span> about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thing</span>s. This is a confusing one. Just think of it more like someone talking about things, anything, really. Someone who just talks about things is someone who tells stories. So, this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tale</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> story</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> legend</span> (not the Tom Cruise one, though).
* The reading for this is messed up. You have <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [物](https://jisho.org/search/物)</span> as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もの](https://jisho.org/search/もの)</span>, which is fine, but <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [語](https://jisho.org/search/語)</span> decides to go all crazy on you. Maybe you've heard the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もの](https://jisho.org/search/もの)がたり</span> before (it's in some film names / book names). If not, think of a story being told about a great <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gatling</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がたり](https://jisho.org/search/がたり)</span>) gun that wandered the land, mowing everything down in its path. It's a terrible legend, but what if it were true???
