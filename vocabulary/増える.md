## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> increase</span>, so the vocabulary verb version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to increase</span>. This is when something is just increasing on its own, and you're not doing the increasing. You know this because you like to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> err</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [える](https://jisho.org/search/える)</span>) on the side of caution and not touch anything when it's increasing, therefore you're not doing any of the increasing yourself (it's just happening).
* It would be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foo</span>lish (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>) of you to touch anything while things are increasing anyways. You don't want to mess up a good thing, do you? Don't be a fool.
