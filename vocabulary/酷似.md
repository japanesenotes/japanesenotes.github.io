## Mnemonics:

* 
* If you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> resemble</span> someone who's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cruel</span>, you, well, you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> resemble</span> them. Maybe you're really mean too. I guess only you can know that. But you do look like that other guy...
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [似](https://jisho.org/search/似)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />Which cruel guy do you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> resemble</span>? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Je</span>sus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span>), of course. I mean, you look just like him. Look in the mirror if you don't believe me. Look, there he is. Wait, what do you mean he isn't a cruel guy? I guess you're the cruel one then. Sucks to be you.
* 酷, 似
* Cruel, Resemble
