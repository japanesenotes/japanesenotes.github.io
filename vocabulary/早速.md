## Mnemonics:
私はその茄子を早速彼に送ります。
* I will send the eggplants to him at once.
* Doing something both <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fast</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> early</span> probably requires you to do it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> at once</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> immediately</span>. Whatever it is, be sure to do it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> without delay</span>.
* The reading for this one is strange. The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [速](https://jisho.org/search/速)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そく](https://jisho.org/search/そく)</span>) is what you'd expect (on'yomi), but <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [早](https://jisho.org/search/早)</span> gets a reading you haven't seen before, meaning you should treat this as an exception. Just think about how you're learning this word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> at once</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> without delay</span> so there's no time for any <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sa</span>ss (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さっ](https://jisho.org/search/さっ)</span>), just kanji learning.
* 早, 速
* Early, Fast
