## Mnemonics:
隣の席の人が劇の最中にずっと指をポキポキ鳴らしてて、すっごく苛々しました。
* The person next to me was constantly cracking their knuckles during the show and it was so annoying.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> drama</span>). Can also mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> play</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> show</span> as well.
* The reading is the same as the kanji. No more drama from you, okay?
* 劇
* Drama
* [sound:劇_b.mp3]
* [sound:劇_g.mp3]
