## Mnemonics:
彼はクラスのお調子者で、いつもボケているが、暗記力はすごい。
* He's the class clown and is always playing the fool, but he is very good at memorization.
* In the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dark</span> if you try to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> write down</span> something it won't work very well. You can't see. So, how can you write something down in the dark? You write it down in your mind. This is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> memorization</span>! Recognize this word? The SRS application Anki comes from this word, I'm guessing!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 暗, 記
* Dark, Write Down
* [sound:暗記_b.mp3]
