* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> new</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lodge</span> area is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shinjuku</span>, a popular district in Tokyo. Perhaps there are many places to stay in Shinjuku. Either way, you should visit, it's fun! It will help if you've heard of Shinjuku before, too. Do some research about Shinjuku if you've never heard of it.
