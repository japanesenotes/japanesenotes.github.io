## Mnemonics:
コップ一ぱいの水とあいをください。
* Give me a cup of water and some love, please.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />You take a look at some water. It jumps out and takes the form of a woman. Hello, my name is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> miss</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みず](https://jisho.org/search/みず)</span>) Mizu, she says.
