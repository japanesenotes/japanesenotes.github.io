You need this in order to complete your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> master's degree</span>. It's hard to get one of those things, and even though samurais didn't really get master's degrees all too much, they had the discipline for it.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
