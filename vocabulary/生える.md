## Mnemonics:
こんなところにキノコが生えるのかね。
* Do mushrooms grow in places like this?
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. Remember how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [生きる](https://jisho.org/search/生きる)</span> means to live? Well this is what happens right after it starts to live. It begins <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to grow</span>!
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />When something starts <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to grow</span> it also learns to laugh. Imagine a little plant growing out of the ground laughing. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ha</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span>) ha ha ha! it says, as it sprouts out of the ground.
* 生
* Life
