## Mnemonics:
小説をたった八冊出版したからって、自分の事を小説家だなんて呼びませんよ。五十冊出版すれば、もしかするとそう呼ぶかもしれないけどね。
* I won’t call myself a fiction writer after only publishing eight books. If I publish fifty books, then I’ll call myself that.
* When you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eight</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> books</span> you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eight books</span>. This is an example of how to count books, so if you have eight of them this is what you'd say.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はち](https://jisho.org/search/はち)</span> part gets shortened as it often does when put into situations like this, making it <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はっ](https://jisho.org/search/はっ)</span>. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [冊](https://jisho.org/search/冊)</span> is all normal, and to the book(s). Har!
* 八, 冊
* Eight, Book Counter
