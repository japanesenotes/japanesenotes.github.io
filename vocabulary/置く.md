## Mnemonics:

* 
* When you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> put</span> something you don't just put it, you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to put down</span> this item or even <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> (to) set down</span> the item. Basically, you have to put something down with this verb. It's a little different from the kanji meaning you learned but not that different.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Just imagine you're putting down <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> O</span>reos (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)</span>). One after another. Each oreo that you try <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to put down</span> say in your head Hello Mr. Oreo, I'm going to put you down.. ooh yes, you like that don't you? REPEAT.
