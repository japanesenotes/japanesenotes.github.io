## Mnemonics:
なぁ、さくらちゃん、例えば、週に一度や二度ぐらい、うちに来ないか？
* Hey, Sakura, why don’t you come over to my house, like, once or twice a week or something?
* This has almost the same meaning as the kanji it comes from. Instead of just simply being example, though, it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> for example</span>. So, you could start a sentence with this and be all like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [例えば](https://jisho.org/search/例えば)</span>, I am using <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [例えば](https://jisho.org/search/例えば)</span> in a sentence.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Using all kinds of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> for examples</span> like this, you were <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> taught</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たと](https://jisho.org/search/たと)</span>) many things throughout your life. For example, you were taught about...
* 例
* Example
* [sound:例えば_b.mp3]
* [sound:例えば_g.mp3]
