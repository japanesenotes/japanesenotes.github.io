## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Wearing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> silk</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>) to not being <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nude</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぬ](https://jisho.org/search/ぬ)</span>). Wear it!
