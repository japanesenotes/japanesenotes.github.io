僕の手は他の人のよりも15倍も大きいけど、それでも野球ボールをうまく受けることができないんだ。
* Even though my hands are fifteen times larger than anyone else’s, I still can’t catch a baseball very well.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> receive</span> and so the verb vocab version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to receive</span>.
* What do you want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to receive</span> from another person more than anything else in the world? Delicious <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [u](https://jisho.org/search/u)</span>ni (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span>). Accepting uni from someone is (not only yummy) but it means they really, really like you.
