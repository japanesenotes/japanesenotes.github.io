## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* A bunch of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sack</span>s or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> straw bag</span>s are stacked upon each other to make a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tower</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たわら](https://jisho.org/search/たわら)</span>). Imagine walking into this sack tower and wonder how it's all held together. Such poor architecture.
