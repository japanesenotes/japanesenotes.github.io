## Mnemonics:
「もし終電に乗り遅れたら、いつでも電話してくれていいよ。」「有難う。覚えておくよ。」
* If you ever miss the last train, you can always call me. Thanks, I’ll keep that in mind.
* We've seen a few times where <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [電](https://jisho.org/search/電)</span> refers to a train. They're big deals, after all, and use a ton of electricity. So, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> end</span> train for this word would refer to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> last train</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 終, 電
* End, Electricity
* [sound:終電_b.mp3]
