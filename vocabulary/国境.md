## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> country</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boundary</span> is that country's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> national border</span>. Be careful about crossing it if you're carrying bananas. The border police seem to hate when you tell them you're carrying a banana in your pants when they ask you if you're bringing any fruits back. No idea why.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こく](https://jisho.org/search/こく)</span> gets shortened to a nice little <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こっ](https://jisho.org/search/こっ)</span>.
* 国, 境
* Country, Boundary
