## Mnemonics:
「昨夜、フグとデートをしたの。」「どうだった？」「楽しかった。めちゃくちゃ笑ったわ。」
* I had a date with Fugu last night. How did it go? It was fun. I laughed a lot.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> laugh</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to laugh</span>.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. You can laugh freely, now!
* 笑
* Laugh
* [sound:笑う_b.mp3]
* [sound:笑う_g.mp3]
