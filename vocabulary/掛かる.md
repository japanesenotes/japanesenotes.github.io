## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [掛ける](https://jisho.org/search/掛ける)</span> is to hang something. This is the version where something hangs by itself. At some point someone decided for it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be hung</span> and now it's hanging there. You know this because there is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> car</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かる](https://jisho.org/search/かる)</span>) hanging there on the wall. How silly, you certainly didn't hang it, that would be impossible. It's just hanging by itself.
* The reading is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [掛ける](https://jisho.org/search/掛ける)</span>, so as long as you know that you know this too.
* 掛
* Hang
