## Mnemonics:

* 
* The place with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Italy</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> force</span> is a place known as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ise</span>. It's a region of Japan that has a nice peninsula, I think. Going straight to the reading for this one may be your best bet.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. Just watch out, because this uses the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せ](https://jisho.org/search/せ)</span>, not the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せ](https://jisho.org/search/せ)い</span> you're used to seeing.
* 伊, 勢
* Italy, Force
