## Mnemonics:
セーラームーンの命が危ない！
* Sailor Moon’s life is in danger!
* The kanji for this means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fate</span>... but what is your fate, really? Your fate is to live out your life the way you're being fated to live out your life. Then, when your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> life</span> runs out, your fate runs out.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:  <br />The Book of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Enoch</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いのち](https://jisho.org/search/いのち)</span>) has passed down your fate and told you how to use your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> life</span>. You must read the book of Enoch and find out what you're supposed to do.
* 命
* Fate
* [sound:命_b.mp3]
* [sound:命_g.mp3]
