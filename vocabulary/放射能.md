* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [放射](https://jisho.org/search/放射)</span> is radiation. Add the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ability</span> of radiation and you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> radioactivity</span>, for some reason. I guess things don't have radioactivity until you have given them the ability of radiation, right?
