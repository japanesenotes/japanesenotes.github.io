## Mnemonics:
警察官は、路地まで苺泥棒を追いかけた。
* The policeman chased the mugger who stole the strawberries down the alley.
* If you think about it, an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> earth</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> road</span> isn't going to be the main road. It will be the road less traveled. You could call it a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> path</span> (you know, like a dirt path!). Alternatively, another less traveled street that would probably be made out of dirt back in the day (before everything was paved) would be an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alley</span>. Imagine yourself walking down a dirt alley at night with no shoes. Scary!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You've learned these readings already, so you should be able to read this word too! And remember, that it's the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span> reading that you learned with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [生地](https://jisho.org/search/生地)</span> here. 
* 路, 地
* Road, Earth
* [sound:路地_b.mp3]
* [sound:路地_g.mp3]
