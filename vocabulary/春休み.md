* Are you over your cold yet? It sucks having a cold during spring break, eh? If it’s still bad, don’t stay up late. Get well soon.
* You've seen <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [夏休み](https://jisho.org/search/夏休み)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [冬休み](https://jisho.org/search/冬休み)</span>. If that isn't enough, you can see that this is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spring</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rest</span> of some kind. That would be a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spring break</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spring vacation</span>.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [春](https://jisho.org/search/春)</span> is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [休み](https://jisho.org/search/休み)</span> part is the same as the vocab word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [休み](https://jisho.org/search/休み)</span>, which hopefully you can read! If you know those readings, you can read this too.
* 春, 休
* Spring, Rest
