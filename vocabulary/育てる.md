## Mnemonics:
小学校の時、クラスで何を育ててた？うちのクラスはおたまじゃくしとハムスターとなすを育ててたんだけど、ハムスターはみんな逃げてねこに食べられちゃった。
* What did you raise as a class when you were in elementary school? Our class was raising tadpoles, hamsters, and eggplants, but all of the hamsters ran away and got eaten by cats.
* This is similar to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [育つ](https://jisho.org/search/育つ)</span>, except now you're doing the raising of someone. This word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to bring up</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to raise</span>. You can remember this because of the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てる](https://jisho.org/search/てる)</span>. Your version of bringing a child up involves <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tear</span>ing (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てる](https://jisho.org/search/てる)</span>) all their clothes to make them look poor so they can get the cheaper lunch at school. You're rich because of all the tax breaks you get from all the children you're raising, but you could always use more money to fuel your StarCraft addiction (we've all been there).
* The reading comes from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [育つ](https://jisho.org/search/育つ)</span>. So long as you know that one, you know how to read this one as well.
* 育
* Nurture
