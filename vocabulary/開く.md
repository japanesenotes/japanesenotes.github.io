## Mnemonics:
「すみません。トーフグ博物館は明日は開いてますか？」「開いてますよ。でも、混雑が予想されるので、早めにお越しになられることをお勧めします。」「分かりました。有難うございます。」
* Excuse me. Is the Tofugu Museum open for business tomorrow? Yes, but it might be quite busy, so I suggest you get there early. Okay, thank you.
* You should know <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [開ける](https://jisho.org/search/開ける)</span> by now. This word is similar to that, except it has to do with when things are just open. It's the same thing, though. The meaning is also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to open</span>.
* The reading can come from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [開ける](https://jisho.org/search/開ける)</span>. So if you know the reading of that word (I hope you do!) then you can apply that knowledge here.
* 開
* Open
* [sound:開く_b.mp3]
* [sound:開く_g.mp3]
