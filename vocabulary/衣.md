## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* You pick up some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clothes</span>. Hmm, I'd like to wear these, you think. But, the shopkeeper comes up and says, in a really weird accent, No, I'm afraid those are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ころも</span> clothes. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ころも](https://jisho.org/search/ころも)</span> clothes? What is that? Oh... you find out this guy has a speech impediment and is trying to say <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こども](https://jisho.org/search/こども)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子供](https://jisho.org/search/子供)</span>) clothes. Try to say the word with him, but he keeps saying it wrong. You get frustrated and blurt out, It's the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> to not being <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nude</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きぬ](https://jisho.org/search/きぬ)</span>)! This does the trick, he lets you have your <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ころも](https://jisho.org/search/ころも)</span> clothes and goes into the back room to cry.
