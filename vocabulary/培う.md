## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cultivate</span> and the verb vocab version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to cultivate</span>.
* You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two chee</span>se <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>rs (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つちか](https://jisho.org/search/つちか)</span>) that are growing mold. But that's a good thing, because it's the good kind of cheese mold. So, you cultivate the mold on these two cheese cars, comparing the difference between the two.
