## Mnemonics:
「申し申し。鈴木と申しますが、佐藤さんはいらっしゃいますか？」
* Hello? This is Suzuki calling. Could I speak to Mr. Satou, please?
* It's kind of like you're saying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> say</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> say</span>. This is what you say when you answer or greet someone on the telephone. There's a strange story about this. One reason you say <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [申し申し](https://jisho.org/search/申し申し)</span> is because it's hard for foxes to say. So, you're confirming that the other person isn't a fox. The other explanation is that operators would say this, letting the person know on the other line that they're talking by saying say say but in a humble way. Either way, this is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> telephone hello</span>, so say it next time you talk to someone on the phone who is Japanese... just to make sure they aren't a fox.<br />We usually don't use kanji for this, so don't use it when you're writing. But you'll probably run into it in the wild so it's good to know!
* This word uses the reading you learned with the kanji. You should know it already.
* 申
* Say Humbly
* [sound:申し申し_b.mp3]
