## Mnemonics:
あなたの耳たぶに付いてるそれ、何？
* What’s that thing attached to your earlobe?
* You know the that the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [付ける]([付](https://jisho.org/search/付)ける)</span> means to attach and you know that the kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [付](https://jisho.org/search/付)</span> means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attach</span>. So, this word probably has something to do with attaching. This is the intransitive version, though, where something is attached (and you're not doing the attaching). You can use the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [く](https://jisho.org/search/く)</span> as a hint. You see something attached on the wall. You say Coo'
* The reading can be derived from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [付ける]([付](https://jisho.org/search/付)ける)</span>, a word you should have seen a few levels ago. If you know that word's reading you should be able to figure out this word's reading as well (and vice versa).
