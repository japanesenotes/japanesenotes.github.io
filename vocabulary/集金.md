やらなければならない仕事が山のようにあるよ。とりあえず、お客さんから集金することから始めようかな。
* I’ve got tons of work I have to catch up on. Anyway, maybe I should start collecting money from my clients.
* When you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> collect</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gold</span> you are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> collecting money</span> (or doing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> money collection</span>). Of course, back in the day gold was like money, which is why this word works the way it does. Hopefully you don't have to deal with too much <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [集金](https://jisho.org/search/集金)</span> in your daily life. We'll try to keep WaniKani nice and reasonably priced for you.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
