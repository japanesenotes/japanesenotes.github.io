## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> drunk</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be drunk</span>.<br />This drunk feeling also happens to some people in boats and cars. But we call that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be seasick</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be carsick</span>. You aren't actually drunk, but you feel like you are (and you're probably gonna puke, yuck!).
* I'm not drunk, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よ](https://jisho.org/search/よ)</span>). YO. I'm not drunk, yo. YO. Yo, I'm not drunk. Yo.
* 酔
* Drunk
