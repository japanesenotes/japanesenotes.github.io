## Mnemonics:
この機械は、お金を取りあげるけどなんの見返りもくれないから、気をつけた方がいいよ。
* You should be aware that this machine takes your money and gives you nothing in return.
* The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)</span> is an honorific that makes this word a bit more fancy. When you're talking about money you gotta be fancy, after all. So, you're basically saying gold in a nicer way. What was gold back in the day? It was <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> money</span>.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [金](https://jisho.org/search/金)</span> is different from the one you learned with the kanji. Makes sense since this is a single kanji with hiragana attached. Here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You've saved up a ton of money. With it you're going to buy something awesome. Then, suddenly someone hits you in the knees with a bat. Now you have to spend all your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> money</span> buying a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cane</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かね](https://jisho.org/search/かね)</span>). Sucks for you :(
* 金
* Gold
* [sound:お金_b.mp3]
* [sound:お金_g.mp3]
