## Mnemonics:
こないだ仙田さんが勧めてくれた仙川のケーキ屋さん、とってもおいしかったよ！
* The cake shop in Sengawa, which Ms. Senda recommended the other day, was really delicious!
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> recommend</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to recommend</span>.
* This has the same reading as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [薦める](https://jisho.org/search/薦める)</span>, which means essentially the same thing. I recommend you learn them both.
* 勧
* Recommend
* [sound:勧める_b.mp3]
* [sound:勧める_g.mp3]
