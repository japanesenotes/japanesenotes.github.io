## Mnemonics:
早く洋服を着ないと、学校に遅れるわよ。
* You should get dressed really quickly or you’ll be late for school.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Western style</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clothes</span> is just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Western clothing</span> (or Western style clothes). But nowadays, because Japanese people wear Western clothing all the time, we use it to just mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clothes</span>. We're talking things that aren't kimonos, etc.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 洋, 服
* Western Style, Clothes
