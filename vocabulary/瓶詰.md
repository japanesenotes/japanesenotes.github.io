## Mnemonics:

* 
* What's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stuffed</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bottle</span>? Jam you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bottled</span> for later! How could you forget?
* This word consists of the on'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [瓶](https://jisho.org/search/瓶)</span> and the kun'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [詰](https://jisho.org/search/詰)</span> that you learned when you learned <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [詰](https://jisho.org/search/詰)める</span>. You've learned them both so as long as you remember the rendaku, you should be able to read this word too! Just remember that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [詰](https://jisho.org/search/詰)</span> is taking the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [め](https://jisho.org/search/め)</span> from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [詰](https://jisho.org/search/詰)める</span> with it in this word too. You can't see it, but it's there.
* 瓶, 詰
* Bottle, Stuffed
