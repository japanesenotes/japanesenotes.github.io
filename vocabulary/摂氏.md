* Okay, so this is a stretch but stay with me! <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> In addition</span> to your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> family name</span>, the first thing you need to learn as a child is how to understand <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> centigrade</span>. If you can't tell what temperature it is outside, or in your house, or in your body to tell if you're sick, you won't do so well with this living thing. So when you think back to the first things you learned in addition to your own family name, think centigrade!
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
* 摂, 氏
* In Addition, Family Name
