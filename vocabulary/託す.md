## Mnemonics:

* 
* If you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> consign</span> something to someone, you are going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to entrust</span> them with that item. Here you go, I entrust you.
* The reading for this one is super weird, but I will entrust you with this knowledge, nonetheless. The reading comes from the on'yomi reading, which is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たく](https://jisho.org/search/たく)</span>, and is the one you learned. It doesn't make any sense, but that's how the ball bounces here.
* 託
* Consign
