## Mnemonics:
ようやく子どもから手が放れたと思ったんだが、五十三歳の妻がまた妊娠してしまってね。
* I thought that I was finally free of having to care for my children but then my 53-year-old wife got pregnant again.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> release</span> and the verb vocab version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be released</span>. You can differentiate this one from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [放す](https://jisho.org/search/放す)</span> (to release) by thinking that it's pretty <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rare</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れる](https://jisho.org/search/れる)</span>) for you to be released by your arch nemesis. He just let you go, strangely. How rare.
* The reading comes from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [放す](https://jisho.org/search/放す)</span>. As long as you know that word you can apply that reading over here as well.
* 放
* Release
* [sound:放れる_b.mp3]
* [sound:放れる_g.mp3]
