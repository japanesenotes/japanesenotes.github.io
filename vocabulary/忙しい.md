## Mnemonics:
今日は忙しかったね。なんてったって、今日だけで千語も新しい日本語を学んだんだから。
* Today was hectic. Just today, we learned 1000 new Japanese words.
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> busy</span>? It's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> busy</span>.
* You're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> busy</span> because you have to take care of your friend's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ice ogre</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)そが</span>) this weekend. You don't know why you agreed to this, you were busy enough, but now you'll never get anything done running around taking care of these little ice ogres.
