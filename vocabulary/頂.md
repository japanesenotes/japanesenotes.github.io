## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> summit</span> and this word can mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> summit</span> too, but also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crown</span>, which goes on the summit of a person at the top of the social summit's head.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You should already know this reading from when you learned <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [頂く](https://jisho.org/search/頂く)</span>. If you can remember that, you can remember this too!
