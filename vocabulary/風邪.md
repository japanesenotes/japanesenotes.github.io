## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wind</span> that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wicked</span> comes and blows on you. It's so cold, and ends up getting you sick. You now have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cold</span>.
* Strangely, the reading for this word is the same as the vocab reading of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [風](https://jisho.org/search/風)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かぜ](https://jisho.org/search/かぜ)</span>). That's probably going to be the easiest way to remember this, especially since otherwise the reading would be one big horrible exception.
* 風, 邪
* Wind, Wicked
