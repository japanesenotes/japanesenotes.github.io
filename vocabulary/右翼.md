## Mnemonics:

* 
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> right</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wing</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> right wing</span>. As in, right wing politics or right wing beliefs.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [右](https://jisho.org/search/右)</span>, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />Those in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> right wing</span> love eating <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> u</span>ni (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span>), not because they like the taste, but because uni is expensive. Picture some right-wing people in your mind right now and watch as they try really hard to pretend they like eating uni as they shovel buckets of it down their throats.
* 右, 翼
