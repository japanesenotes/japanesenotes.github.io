## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* You'll remember this kanji to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> extent</span> that you study it. If you study it like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Hodo</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほど](https://jisho.org/search/ほど)</span>) would study it, you won't learn it at all. You would only be able to say hodor, hodor, over and over again, which isn't helpful at all.
