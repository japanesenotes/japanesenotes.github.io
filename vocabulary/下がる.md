## Mnemonics:
ズボンが下がるようにベルトをゆるめなさい。
* Unfasten your belt so that your pants will hang down.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb.<br />This is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> below</span> so this means something gets lower, by falling or dropping. For example: Prices get lower or fall. Squirrels come down from trees. See? No direct object here. That's why this verb means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to get lower</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to fall</span>.
* Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. Let's use a mnemonic to remember the reading of the kanji:<br />You know it means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to fall</span> so instead of using a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sa</span>w (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)</span>) to cut down the tree, you decide to let it come to you. It has to come down all by itself. Picture yourself placing a saw at the foot of a tree then sitting back and waiting for it to drop itself at your knees. (This could actually work, don't you judge my methods!)
