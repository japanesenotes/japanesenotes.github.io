## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> encounter</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to encounter</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to meet</span>.
* Remember how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [会う](https://jisho.org/search/会う)</span> also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to meet</span>? Well they're both read <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あう](https://jisho.org/search/あう)</span> too! So if you know that one, you know this one too!
