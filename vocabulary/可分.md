預貯金などの可分債権は、原則として遺産分割の対象にはなりません。
* As a general rule, divisible claims, like savings accounts, do not become the target of divisions of inherited property.
* When it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> possible</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> separate</span> something, it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> divisible</span>. Just imagine separating things into parts. It's possible. So, if that's possible, it's divisible. Now think of something that's nothing (i.e. no candy bars). That is not possible to separate into parts. That is not divisible.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 可, 分
* Possible, Part
