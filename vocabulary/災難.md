## Mnemonics:
どうしてあいつはあんなに災難に見舞われてばかりいるのかな？本当に偶然なのか、それともあいつ自体に何か問題があるんだろうか。
* I wonder why misfortune is always following that guy? Is it just by chance or is there something wrong with him?
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> disaster</span> that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> difficult</span> is particularly difficult, making it more of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> misfortune</span>. Obviously a disaster that wasn't difficult wouldn't really be that bad, so a difficult one gets the misfortune or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> calamity</span> label.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 災, 難
* Disaster, Difficult
* [sound:災難_b.mp3]
* [sound:災難_g.mp3]
