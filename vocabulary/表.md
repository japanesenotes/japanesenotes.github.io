## Mnemonics:
十円玉の表はどちらですか？
* Which side of a ten yen coin is the face?
* This is the noun version of the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> express</span>. If you want to understand what something is trying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> express</span> you usually look at its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> front</span> or its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exterior</span>. This word is usually used for the exterior face of buildings.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet though, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You're standing in front of a building, staring at its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> front</span>. You spend some time gazing at it before you realize what it is. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Oh</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> motel</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おもて](https://jisho.org/search/おもて)</span>), you say aloud. A little time looking at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exterior</span> and you're able to figure it out.
