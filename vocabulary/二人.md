## Mnemonics:
かのじょは二人ごろしでたいほされた。
* She was arrested for double murder.
* When you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> person</span> and then put them together, what do you get? You get a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pair</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two people</span>.
* The reading for this word is quite strange. If you know <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [二つ]([二](https://jisho.org/search/二)つ)</span>'s reading, you can use that to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [二](https://jisho.org/search/二)</span> part (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふた](https://jisho.org/search/ふた)</span>). But, the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [り](https://jisho.org/search/り)</span> that is the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [人](https://jisho.org/search/人)</span> is a total exception, something you won't see too often (though you may have seen it in <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [一人](https://jisho.org/search/一人)</span>). If you can use the reading of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [一人](https://jisho.org/search/一人)</span> (aka if you've learned it already) then definitely use that. If not, do your best to remember the reading on your own. It's a strange one that doesn't connect to much else.
* 二, 人
* Two, Person
* [sound:二人_b.mp3]
* [sound:二人_g.mp3]
