## Mnemonics:
君が満足する結果が得られないのはかわいそうだけど、自分がしたことじゃないのに謝るつもりはないよ。
* I feel bad that you won’t get a satisfying result, but I refuse to apologize for something I didn’t do.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> apologize</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to apologize</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: When you say you're sorry <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to apologize</span>, you'd probably start with: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> I am</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あやま](https://jisho.org/search/あやま)</span>) sorry!
* 謝
* Apologize
* [sound:謝る_b.mp3]
