## Mnemonics:
「すみません。汽車は何分おきに来ますか？」「大体20分おきくらいです。」
* Excuse me, how often do the steam trains come? About every twenty minutes.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> steam</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> car</span> is a car that runs on steam. No regular car runs on steam, but what thing that has things called cars does run on steam? How about a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> steam train</span>? You can also think about <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [電車](https://jisho.org/search/電車)</span>s, which are electric cars (but means train). This is similar to that, but now it's run with steam, making it a steam train.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 汽, 車
* Steam, Car
* [sound:汽車_b.mp3]
