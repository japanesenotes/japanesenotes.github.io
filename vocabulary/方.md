## Mnemonics:
かの女のわらい方がきらいだ。
* I don’t like the way she laughs.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading, but it can be either that or the on'yomi reading, depending on the context. You haven't learned the kun'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [方](https://jisho.org/search/方)</span> yet, so there's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You need to go a certain <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> direction</span>. How do you get there? By jumping into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cata</span>pult (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かた](https://jisho.org/search/かた)</span>) and shooting yourself the right <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> way</span>. Need to get a particular direction fast? Consider the catapult next time.
* 方
