## Mnemonics:
「分かりましたか？」 「申し訳ないのですが、チンプンカンプンで全然分かりません。今言ったことをもう少しゆっくり言っていただけませんか？」
* Did you get that? I’m sorry. I’m completely lost. Could you say that again more slowly?
* It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> all</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nature</span> out there. It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> entirely</span> nature and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> not at all</span> city. <br />This word is weird. It means two opposite things. Thanks Japanese! Just look out for a negative word after the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [全然](https://jisho.org/search/全然)</span>. If it is negative it's not at all if it's not negative it might be entirely.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 全, 然
* All, Nature
* [sound:全然_b.mp3]
