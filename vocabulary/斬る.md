* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> slice</span> and the verb vocab version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to cut down</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to slice off</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to lop off</span>. This word mainly refers to cutting people with a sword, if you haven't figured it out yet.
