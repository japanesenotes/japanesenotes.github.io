## Mnemonics:
彼は誰の忠告も絶対に受けないなんて言っていたが、美人の忠告なら話は別だろう。
* He says he never needs advice from anyone, but as soon as a beautiful woman offers him some, he’s all ears.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> person</span> who is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beautiful</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beautiful woman</span>. Wait, why isn't this a beautiful person? Because of course only women can be beautiful - men tend to be handsome, or just generally not as good looking. So, while both beautiful woman and beautiful person are technically correct, you're generally only going to hear it as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beautiful woman</span>, so remember that meaning.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 美, 人
* Beauty, Person
* [sound:美人_b.mp3]
* [sound:美人_g.mp3]
