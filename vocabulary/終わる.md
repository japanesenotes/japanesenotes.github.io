## Mnemonics:
おい、こら！引っ込んでろ！原子爆弾の解体が終わるまでは、私に近づくなと言っただろ。
* Hey, man! Back off! I told you to stay away from me until the atomic bomb has finished being dismantled.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> end</span> and so the verb version of this is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to end</span> (or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to finish</span>).
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />It is time <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to end</span> this. You are the debt collector and so you go to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ower</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おわ](https://jisho.org/search/おわ)</span>) to collect what is due. Hey, it's time to end this fool! You are the ower!
* 終
* End
* [sound:終わる_b.mp3]
* [sound:終わる_g.mp3]
