## Mnemonics:

* 
* Throw your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> family crest</span> into the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wave</span>s and you'll make lots of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ripple</span>s. There will probably also be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> repercussions</span> with your family because those things are important and you really shouldn't be tossing them into the sea's waves.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
* 波, 紋
* Wave, Family Crest
