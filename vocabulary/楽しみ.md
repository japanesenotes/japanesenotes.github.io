## Mnemonics:
私達、みんな亀を燃やすのを楽しみにしているんだよね？
* We are all looking forward to burning turtles, aren’t we?
* You've seen the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [楽しい](https://jisho.org/search/楽しい)</span>, which means fun. This is obviously very similar looking, though this one means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> looking forward to</span>. Why? Because it has a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [み](https://jisho.org/search/み)</span> on the end, saying who is going to have fun? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> me</span>! That's why I'm looking forward to it!
* The reading is just like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [楽しい](https://jisho.org/search/楽しい)</span>, so make sure you know that and you'll be able to read this one as well.
* 楽
* Comfort
* [sound:楽しみ_b.mp3]
* [sound:楽しみ_g.mp3]
