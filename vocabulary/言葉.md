## Mnemonics:
私は言葉に詰まった。
* I was at a loss for words.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> leaf</span> of the things you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> say</span> is like a leaf from a tree of speaking. That leaf is a part of the whole language, it is a single <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> word</span>, though it can add up to be a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> language</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> manner of speech</span>.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [言](https://jisho.org/search/言)</span> is one you haven't learned. It's kind of an exception, in fact, though you might see it from time to time. You'll want to imagine yourself playing a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> koto</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こと](https://jisho.org/search/こと)</span>). Each strum of the instrument sends forth several <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> word</span>s from its strings, flying at the person you're talking to. You speak your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> word</span>s via music, specifically the koto (so think about using other instruments as well to communicate... they just don't work).
* 言, 葉
* Say, Leaf
