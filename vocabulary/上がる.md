## Mnemonics:
けむりが上がってる。
* Smoke is rising. 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb.<br />This is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> above</span> so this means something rises. For example: A fever rises. The sun rises. See? No direct object here. That's why this verb means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to rise</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to go up</span>.
* Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you can guess that it uses the kun'yomi reading, which also happens to be a reading you didn't learn when you learned the kanji. Let's use a mnemonic for the kun'yomi reading now, though. You have to remember at least the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あ](https://jisho.org/search/あ)</span> part to read it.<br />You know that this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to rise</span>. Imagine something just rising on its own, like a floating tree or something. What would you say? Probably a surprised sound. Maybe you'd scream <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> あ</span>! when you saw this floating tree.
