* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> law</span> of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> move</span>ment is governed by <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rhythm</span>. Imagine moving around to a boss beat. As you move, you start to feel the rhythm in your step. Go ahead and walk around your room and feel this rhythm. <br />Note that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [リズム](https://jisho.org/search/リズム)</span> is probably going to be more common of a word to use for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rhythm</span>, but this is a kanji learning site after all. One thing you will see more often is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [律動的](https://jisho.org/search/律動的)</span> which means rhythmic.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
