## Mnemonics:
私は薬の中で座薬が一番好きです。
* My favorite kind of medicine is the suppository kind.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. If you're looking for medicine in Japan, look for this sign.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You need some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> medicine</span>, stat! But, nobody wants to give you any medicine. You keep asking your pharmacist, Yuri, if he'll give you some medicine. He says no. You get pissed off, and you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cuss yuri</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くすり](https://jisho.org/search/くすり)</span>) out. He gives you the medicine after you cuss him out.
* 薬
