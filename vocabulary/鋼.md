## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You take a look at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> steel</span>. It's shaped like a person. Turns out you turned that hag into a steel statue. You say, huh, that's the hag <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ね](https://jisho.org/search/ね)</span>? (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はがね](https://jisho.org/search/はがね)</span>). Whoops, sorry hag lady.
