## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Cook</span>ed <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sake</span> is slightly higher in alcohol content. This is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shochu</span>, which I'm guessing gets cooked in some way during its production.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [焼](https://jisho.org/search/焼)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [酎](https://jisho.org/search/酎)</span> are the on'yomi readings, but you didn't learn the reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [焼](https://jisho.org/search/焼)</span> yet. That's okay, because if you know the (also English) word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shochu</span>, you'll be able to remember the reading for this one as well too.
* 焼, 酎
* Bake, Sake
