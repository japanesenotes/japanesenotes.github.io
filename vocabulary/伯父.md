## Mnemonics:

* 
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chief</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> father</span> isn't your own father, but he is the chief of your father. He's your father's older brother, who has always owned your father. He's your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> uncle</span>. This word can be used for your mother's brother too, but in both cases he has to be the older brother, not younger.
* The reading for this is an exception, at least the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [父](https://jisho.org/search/父)</span> part is, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember:<br />Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> uncle</span> is a very religious man, he is the chief, after all. Whenever you see him he's always shouting, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Oh Je</span>sus! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おじ](https://jisho.org/search/おじ)</span>) at the sky. Your uncle and Jesus are pretty close.
* 伯, 父
* Chief, Father
* [sound:伯父_b.mp3]
