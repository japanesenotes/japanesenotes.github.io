## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pure</span>? It's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pure</span>. People like this are also usually really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gracious</span> to others. This type of pure heart would even be a gracious loser.
* Oh man, the reading for this is... like... crazy. First part can be something like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> it's soggy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)さぎ</span>)... then the second part is like the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [良い](https://jisho.org/search/良い)</span> (good). So, you can think of a pure hearted person eating soggy cereal. He/she is so pure hearted that it doesn't matter to them how soggy it is. In fact, they seem to enjoy it! They keep saying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> it's soggy, good!</span> over and over again while eating the terribly soggy food.
