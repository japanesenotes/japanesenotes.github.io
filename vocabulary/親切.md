わぁ。すごい！なんてクリーミーなの。 信じられない。今まで食べた中で一番のチーズケーキだわ。 あなたってとても親切だから、きっと最後の一切れは私にくれちゃうわよね？でしょ？有難う、有難う！ 
* Wow. Oh my, it’s so creamy. Oh my gosh, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. You are awfully kind to give me the last piece. Don’t you think? Thank you. Thank you.
* When your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> parent</span>s <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cut</span> you you'd think they are being mean... but they're not. They are bleeding all the bad blood out of you. They are truly being <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kind</span>. <br />Just think of how crazy it would be for your parents to cut you... then think about some kind of twist to make it so they are being kind instead.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 親, 切
* Parent, Cut
