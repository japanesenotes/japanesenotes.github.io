## Mnemonics:
「で、私達付き合ってるのよね？どうなの？はっきりさせてよ。」「えーと…」＜その時、インターホンが鳴った。:ピンポーン＞「ふぅ、間一髪で助かった。」
* So, are we going out or what? Make it clear! Um… (The front doorbell rings: ring-ring.) Phew, saved by the bell.
* You know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [助ける](https://jisho.org/search/助ける)</span> means to help - so, this is a different version of that. This is when someone is helping someone else, or something is helping you, but you're not doing the action of helping someone. Use the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span> to help you remember: The car helps you to drive around. That's why this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be helped</span>. <br />It also can be used to talk about how you were rescued, which is like being helped, right? If you want to memorize it that way, that's fine too.
* The reading is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [助ける](https://jisho.org/search/助ける)</span>, so hopefully you know that word and can apply that knowledge over here.
* 助
* Help
