## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> limit</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to limit</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to limit</span> your use of face cream. I know you have a super <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kaggy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かぎ](https://jisho.org/search/かぎ)</span>) face but if you don't limit your use bad things will happen.
