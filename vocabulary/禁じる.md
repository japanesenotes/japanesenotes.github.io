## Mnemonics:
この部屋では、私語を禁じる。
* In this room, whispering is prohibited.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prohibition</span> so the verb version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to prohibit</span>.
* This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
* 禁
* Prohibit
* [sound:禁じる_b.mp3]
* [sound:禁じる_g.mp3]
