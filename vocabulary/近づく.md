## Mnemonics:
私達に今近づいてきているゾンビ、めちゃくちゃ私のタイプなんだけど。
* Strange as it is, the zombie approaching us right now is actually my type.
* Because this word ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you can tell it's probably a verb. The kanji portion means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> near</span>. The verb version of that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to draw near</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to get close</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to approach</span>. Essentially, the general idea is that you're getting closer to something. You're becoming more nearby. You're approaching.
* There's hiragana attached to this kanji, which means it's probably the kun'yomi reading (and it is). You've seen the kun'yomi reading via the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [近い](https://jisho.org/search/近い)</span>. So, as long as you know that word, you should be able to read this one as well.
* 近
* Near
* [sound:近づく_b.mp3]
* [sound:近づく_g.mp3]
