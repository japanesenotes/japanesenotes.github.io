## Mnemonics:
お前は本当に仕方がないやつだ！
* You’re really hopeless!
* The kanji part of this word is like saying the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> doing</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> way</span> ... aka the way you do something. So, when you don't have a way to do something, there's nothing you can do. Thus is born the popular Japanese phrase: <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [仕方がない](https://jisho.org/search/仕方がない)</span>, which means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> can't be helped</span>. This is a very good word to know if you're in Japan.
* The readings for the kanji portion are in line with the readings you learned with the individual kanji, so as long as you know those you should be able to read this word as well.
* 仕, 方
* Doing, Direction
* [sound:仕方がない_b.mp3]
* [sound:仕方がない_g.mp3]
