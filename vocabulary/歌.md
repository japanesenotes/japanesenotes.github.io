## Mnemonics:
「ジェイソン！あんた、アマンダのために歌を作ったの？」「えーと、これはそういうのじゃないんだ。」「もう！とぼけないでよ。」
* Jason! You made a song for Amanda? Ah, this isn’t what it looks like. Come on! Don’t give me that.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />Think about a song... but not just any song... think about the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> utter</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うた](https://jisho.org/search/うた)</span>) song, and make it up right now and sing it out loud. What does the utter song sound like? Why do you love utterances so much that you made a song about them?
* 歌
* Song
* [sound:歌_b.mp3]
* [sound:歌_g.mp3]
