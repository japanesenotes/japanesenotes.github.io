That makes it a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> graduation ceremony</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will help if you know how to read <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [卒業](https://jisho.org/search/卒業)</span> already as a word, too.
