## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> play</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to play with</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to toy with</span> someone.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Everyone always seems to yell at you when you start <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to toy with</span> your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> towe</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たわ](https://jisho.org/search/たわ)</span>). Just because you don't have anything on under it doesn't mean you can't mess with it! Right?!
