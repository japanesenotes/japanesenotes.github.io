## Mnemonics:

* 
* When your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> subscription</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> enter</span>s into effect, you have made your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> purchase</span>. This one's a bit weird because it seems like it should refer to a subscription, but I guess it is a one time subscription, and your subscription lasts your whole life?
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 購, 入
* Subscription, Enter
