## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* In each <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> political wing</span> there are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two boss</span>es (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つばさ](https://jisho.org/search/つばさ)</span>). It's a weird system, but that's how they're doing it these days. Imagine your favorite / least favorite political wings, all with two bosses, arguing with each other.
