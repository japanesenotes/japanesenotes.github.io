## Mnemonics:

* 
* When someone asks you <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [何故](https://jisho.org/search/何故)</span>, or why, you did something, you respond with, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [何故](https://jisho.org/search/何故)なら</span> blah blah blah. That makes it mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> because</span>. Why did you do that? Because I was mad! Why did you dance? Because I was happy!
* This reading is an exception but you learned them already because they're the same as the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [何故](https://jisho.org/search/何故)</span>, which you learned a few levels ago. It just has some kana attached to it!
* 何, 故
* What, Circumstance
