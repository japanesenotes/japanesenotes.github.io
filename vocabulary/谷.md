死の谷で自殺した男は、ダース・ベイダーのコスプレをしていた。
* The guy who committed suicide in Death Valley was dressed as Darth Vader.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. This happens to be the reading you learned with the kanji, too, so don't feel like you're stuck in a valley of despair or anything. Rejoice!
