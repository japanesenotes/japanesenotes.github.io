## Mnemonics:
おやしらずを四ほんともばっしした。
* I had all four of my wisdom teeth pulled out.
* This vocab word has the same meaning as its parent kanji (single alone kanji usually do that!), meaning it means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> four</span>.
* When a vocab is alone like this with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it usually uses its kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception, though, and use the on'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You have to count to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> four</span>. But you're tired. One... two... three... *<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> YAWN</span>* ... four. There, you did it. But *yawn* now you can't stop yawning. You're so, so sleepy. Four is too high a number to count without falling asleep.<br />By the way! Both the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よん](https://jisho.org/search/よん)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span> are pretty common, but because the on'yomi reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span> sounds just like the word for death, it isn't used as much. Generally when you're just counting (for example, 1, 2, 3, 4...), you will use the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>. But when you are counting things or people, you'll use <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よん](https://jisho.org/search/よん)</span>. There are exceptions to this, but you'll learn them as they come up.
