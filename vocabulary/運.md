## Mnemonics:
こんなことで使い果たしたくはないけど、これで運を使い果たしちゃったかも。
* I might have run out of luck though, and I don't want to use it up on something like this.
* This takes the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> luck</span> meaning from the kanji. Think of it this way: If you're carrying you're going to create your own luck. Now nobody will mess with you, kanji gangstah. You carry guns and have a ton of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> luck</span> because of it.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji! How... shall I say... <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> luck</span>-filled?
* 運
* Carry
* [sound:運_b.mp3]
* [sound:運_g.mp3]
