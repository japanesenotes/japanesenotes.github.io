## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lie down</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to lie down</span>, but what you're really doing is trying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to sleep</span>.
* The reading is the same as the reading you learned with the kanji. So, you can go ahead and lie down for a moment before moving on to the next item.
* 寝
* Lie Down
* [sound:寝る_b.mp3]
