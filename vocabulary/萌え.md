## Mnemonics:

* 
* What is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spout</span> doing? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sprouting</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> budding</span>. A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crush</span> you have on someone can sprout too.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Think about that newly <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sprouting</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> moe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もえ](https://jisho.org/search/もえ)</span>) character you have a crush on. Yes, this is the same moe. Congrats, you already know it!
