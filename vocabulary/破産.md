## Mnemonics:

* 
* You'd think this one would have a much different meaning, considering it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tear</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> give birth</span>. This word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bankruptcy</span>, which seems a bit odd, but I guess there's another bankruptcy word with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [産](https://jisho.org/search/産)</span> in it too (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [倒産](https://jisho.org/search/倒産)</span>). That one is fall, and this one is tear. They're both pretty bad, and they both refer to bankruptcy.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
* 破, 産
* Tear, Give Birth
* [sound:破産_b.mp3]
* [sound:破産_g.mp3]
