## Mnemonics:
わたしはハンバーガーをひつぎに入れた。
* I put a hamburger into the coffin.
* This is similar to the vocab word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [入る]([入](https://jisho.org/search/入)る)</span> (to enter), except in this case, instead of entering you're inserting something. So, it's like you're entering something into something else. You can remember that this one is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to insert</span> because it's longer than <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [入る]([入](https://jisho.org/search/入)る)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はいる](https://jisho.org/search/はいる)</span>/to enter). Why? Because it's more difficult to insert something than it is to enter somewhere, which is why you have more help (the extra kana stuck on the end).
* When a vocab is a single kanji plus some okurigana (hiragana stuck on the end of kanji) it's almost always going to be the kun'yomi reading. This is one of two kun'yomi readings you'll be learning for the kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [入](https://jisho.org/search/入)</span>. As long as you know that this vocab means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to insert</span>, you can use that to remember the reading as well. When you insert your hand into the mysterious hole, it feels cold and sticky inside. You scream: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> い</span>! as an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gle flies out.
