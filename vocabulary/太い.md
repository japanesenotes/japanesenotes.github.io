## Mnemonics:
おれの母ちゃんは、ちょう太いんだぜ。
* My mom is so fat.
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fat</span>? It's the same: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fat</span>.
* This is the kun'yomi reading of the kanji (because it's a single kanji, all alone with hiragana attached). The part you have to remember is the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふと](https://jisho.org/search/ふと)</span> portion. Let's use a mnemonic. <br />The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fat</span> guy looked down and couldn't see his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foot</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふと](https://jisho.org/search/ふと)</span>).
