## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />When it comes to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> net</span>s, you gotta go talk to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Amy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あみ](https://jisho.org/search/あみ)</span>) if you want a good one. Only Amy makes good nets.
