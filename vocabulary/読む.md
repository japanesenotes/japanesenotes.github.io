## Mnemonics:
あんたの彼氏が書いた「旅の注意書き」読んだ？二、三本傘を持参するべきって書いてあるけど。
* Did you read the note your boyfriend left you about your trip? It says that you should bring two or three umbrellas with you.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> read</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to read</span>.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Go read something else, now.
* 読
* Read
* [sound:読む_b.mp3]
* [sound:読む_g.mp3]
