「端午の節句」と呼ばれる日本の男の子の日に欠かせないのが、鯉をかたどった「鯉のぼり」と呼ばれる吹き流しです。
* Japan's day for boys, called Boy's Day, would be incomplete without the carp-shaped streamers known as koi nobori.
* Think of what a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> paragraph</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> season</span> would be. It's a small part of the season, but it's worth writing about. That's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seasonal festival</span>. These are fun!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just note that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せつ](https://jisho.org/search/せつ)</span> gets shortened to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せっ](https://jisho.org/search/せっ)</span> just like many <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>s do in this situation.
* 節, 句
* Season, Paragraph
