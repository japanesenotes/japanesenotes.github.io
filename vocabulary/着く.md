## Mnemonics:
電車が時間通りに着かなかったんです。
* The train didn’t arrive on time.
* This word is tough, because there's another word in this level (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [着る]([着](https://jisho.org/search/着)る)</span>) that means to wear that is so similar. This word, however, means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to arrive</span>. You should have seen that meaning with the kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [着](https://jisho.org/search/着)</span> as well, so I hope that helps. To differentiate between this and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [着る]([着](https://jisho.org/search/着)る)</span>, though, zoom in on the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [く](https://jisho.org/search/く)</span>. You want to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coo</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [く](https://jisho.org/search/く)</span>) so you arrive to the party late.
* This uses a different kun'yomi reading than the one you just learned (sorry). To help you, think about this:<br />You wanted <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to arrive</span> on time but you showed up late. How late were you? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Two</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>) hours and two minutes late, to be exact.
* 着
* Wear
* [sound:着く_b.mp3]
* [sound:着く_g.mp3]
