## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coarse</span>? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Coarse</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rough</span>. 
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />The most <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coarse</span> thing you can think of is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a ro</span>ck (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あら](https://jisho.org/search/あら)</span>). You rubbed it on your face and it was really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rough</span> and kinda painful. You probably shouldn't be rubbing a rock on your face, actually.
