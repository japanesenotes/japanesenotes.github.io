## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You are given some soup. You take a bite and your mouth is cut clean off. That is because you're eating <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sheer</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しる](https://jisho.org/search/しる)</span>) soup.
* 汁
* Soup
* [sound:汁_b.mp3]
