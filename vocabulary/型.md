## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: What <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> model</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cutter</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かた](https://jisho.org/search/かた)</span>) is this? I can only use a certain <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> type</span> for my work.
