## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> possible</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pathetic</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> concept</span>. It's not just possibly pathetic, to be honest. It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pitiful</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pathetic</span>, for sure.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. Well, at least most of it does. To remember the reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [哀](https://jisho.org/search/哀)</span> imagine some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pathetic</span> person who lost their home. They may be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pitiful</span> but at some point after losing their home they decided that the hood of your car would make a fine place to live. You can't help but ask them, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Why</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わい](https://jisho.org/search/わい)</span>) my car? There are so many other cars this pathetic person could be camping out on, but they chose yours.
