## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> biased</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be biased</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be prejudiced</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You meet someone who claims <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be biased</span> about everything. You ask them why and they say, I'm a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cutter, yo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かたよ](https://jisho.org/search/かたよ)</span>)! I cut everything in half and only like one of 'em. But I guess if you wanna call that biased go ahead, man. Huh okay.
