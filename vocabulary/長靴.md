## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Long</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shoes</span> aren't long in that the feet part are long (that wouldn't make sense). Instead, the top part is long, making them into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boots</span>.
* The reading is a bit weird. Double kun'yomi, so think along the lines of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [長い](https://jisho.org/search/長い)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [靴](https://jisho.org/search/靴)</span> getting added together. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [靴](https://jisho.org/search/靴)</span> is the reading you learned with the kanji, however. It also gets rendaku'd.
* 長, 靴
* Long, Shoes
* [sound:長靴_b.mp3]
* [sound:長靴_g.mp3]
