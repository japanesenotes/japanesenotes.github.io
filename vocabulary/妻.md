## Mnemonics:
元妻が、「私みたいな女にはもう巡り合わないわよ」とか言うんだけどさ…っていうか、それが俺の計画なんですけど、みたいな？
* My ex-wife says, You’ll never find someone like me. Well exactly! That’s the plan!
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This is used to refer to your own wife, though, for the most part.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wife</span> does everything for you. She feeds you, she bathes you, she cleans up after you and even wipes your butt when you poop. Really, she is doing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> too mu</span>ch (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つま](https://jisho.org/search/つま)</span>), and you should stop being a baby.
* 妻
* Wife
* [sound:妻_b.mp3]
* [sound:妻_g.mp3]
