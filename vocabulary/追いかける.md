## Mnemonics:
シャチの群れを追いかけてるフグを見たよ。
* I saw Fugu following a pod of killer whales.
* You know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [追う](https://jisho.org/search/追う)</span> is to chase. So, you're chasing something or someone, or something similar. Just think of the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かける](https://jisho.org/search/かける)</span> as you being all cocky about it. You're not just chasing this person, you're following them too. So, this word is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to follow</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to stalk</span>. Scary!
* The reading comes from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [追う](https://jisho.org/search/追う)</span> as well as the kanji reading you learned too.
* 追
* Follow
* [sound:追いかける_b.mp3]
