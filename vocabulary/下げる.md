## Mnemonics:
きおんを下げるために、あまごいダンスをおどってみた。
* I tried to perform a rain dance to lower the temperature.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> below</span> so the verb version of that is when you put something below you. It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to lower something</span>.<br />This is a transitive verb. That means it takes a direct object. You lower something. Like your blood pressure!
* Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to lower</span> a tree so you need a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> saw</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)</span>). Lower the tree to the ground gently while you slowly saw it down!
