* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. This is the reading you learned when you learned the kanji, so you're good to go. Don't forget to stop and smell the roses on the way, though.
