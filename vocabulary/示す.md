## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> indicate</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to indicate</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to show</span>. This isn't used for showing a physical thing, this is more like when a study shows that ....
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Studies seem <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to indicate</span> that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> She-ma</span>n (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しめ](https://jisho.org/search/しめ)</span>) is way more powerful than her boyfriend He-man. I mean, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to show</span> you I can just point to her. Look how much bigger her sword and biceps are. Why didn't She-man get her own show?
