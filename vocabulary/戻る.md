## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> return</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to return</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be returned</span>. This is when something does this on its own. You aren't doing the returning of something in this case.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
* 戻
* Return
* [sound:戻る_b.mp3]
* [sound:戻る_g.mp3]
