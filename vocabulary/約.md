* About a million people have liked Tofugu’s Facebook page so far.
* The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> promise</span>, but the meaning of this word is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> about</span>, which is a little different. Just think about promises. When you promise something you really need to follow through... but only about as much as you need to for the other person to be happy. Someone asks for a puppy for Christmas, and you get them a stuffed animal puppy. It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> approximately</span> the promise you made. Close enough. *wink*
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. See? I <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> promise</span>d this one would be easy and it was.
* 約
* Promise
