## Mnemonics:
きつい言い方に聞こえることは分かってるんだけど、つまらない言い訳はしたくないの。
* I understand it sounds harsh, but I’m up to my neck in lame excuses.
* You've seen <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [聞く](https://jisho.org/search/聞く)</span> by now hopefully. This is similar, but instead of meaning to hear it means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hearable</span> (or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be audible</span>). Just think about that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こえ](https://jisho.org/search/こえ)</span> hanging off there as the voice you can hear.
* The reading comes from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [聞く](https://jisho.org/search/聞く)</span>, so if you know the reading of that word, you can apply it here.
* 聞
* Hear
* [sound:聞こえる_b.mp3]
* [sound:聞こえる_g.mp3]
