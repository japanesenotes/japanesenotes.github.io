## Mnemonics:
お集まりの皆さん、本日は度重なる力士の不祥事に関する会議にご出席いただき有難うございます。
* Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending today’s conference regarding the repeated misconduct of our sumo wrestlers.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> power</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> samurai</span> isn't a samurai at all. A Samurai's all about precision, after all. So, imagine someone that's a huge mass of muscle (and fat). This Japanese warrior is all about power... ramming into people as hard as they can to knock them over. This person is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sumo wrestler</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 力, 士
* Power, Samurai
* [sound:力士_b.mp3]
* [sound:力士_g.mp3]
