## Mnemonics:
赤信号の前にいる時、「もうすぐ青に変わるぞ！」と思うとかなり興奮する。
* When I’m in front of a red light, I get very excited at the thought of it turning green soon.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />What's in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> front</span> of you? Think about it. Make it something ridiculous. Now look at a tag that's on it. Who does this thing belong to? Oh, wait, it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> my</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まえ](https://jisho.org/search/まえ)</span>) thing there in front of me. Say that out loud for better memory.
* 前
* Front
* [sound:前_b.mp3]
* [sound:前_g.mp3]
