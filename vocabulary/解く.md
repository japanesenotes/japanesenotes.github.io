## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> solve</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to solve</span>. It also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to untie</span> and you know this verb is when you are doing the actual untying because you think it's super <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coo'</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [く](https://jisho.org/search/く)</span>) to untie things, which is why you do it nonstop.
* The reading is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [解ける](https://jisho.org/search/解ける)</span>, so if you know that you can read this one too.
* 解
* Untie
* [sound:解く_b.mp3]
* [sound:解く_g.mp3]
