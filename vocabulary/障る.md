## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is the verb version of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hinder</span>, but it's what happens when you hinder someone else enough. You'll start <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to irritate</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to annoy</span> them. 
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />If you want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to irritate</span> me, all you have to do is make what I'm eating <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さわ](https://jisho.org/search/さわ)</span>). Did you know sour food is known <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be bad for</span> you, too? Don't make that sour face, stop eating sour things!
