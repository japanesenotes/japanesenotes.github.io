* I got owned in baseball on Tuesday.
* This is a day of the week. You know this because it has <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [曜日](https://jisho.org/search/曜日)</span> in it. But what day of the week is it? The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fire</span> day of the week is the day after the worst day of the week (monday). You set fire to everything because you're so pissed off about yesterday, which makes today <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Tuesday</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. It will help to know the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [曜日](https://jisho.org/search/曜日)</span> as well.
* 火, 曜, 日
