## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dark red</span> color isn't your favorite color, it is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Benny</span>'s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [べに](https://jisho.org/search/べに)</span>) favorite color. If you know someone named Benny, it will help.<br />For the secondary reading, think if you see so much <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [紅](https://jisho.org/search/紅)</span> color (like blood, right?) you know that the person is going to die. You know that there is no cure, aka cure <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ない](https://jisho.org/search/ない)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くれない](https://jisho.org/search/くれない)</span>). Get it?
