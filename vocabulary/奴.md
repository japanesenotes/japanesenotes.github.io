## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: <br />Some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dude</span>... he did it two times. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Yah, two</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [やつ](https://jisho.org/search/やつ)</span>) times.<br />This can seem kind of derogatory, if you say it the wrong way. But as long as you're duding to your dude friends and not your no-dude boss, you should be a-okay to dude-bro it up!
