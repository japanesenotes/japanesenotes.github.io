## Mnemonics:
幸い命に別状はありませんでした。
* Fortunately, it was not life-threatening.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Happiness</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> happiness</span>!
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />If your life is filled with nothing but <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> happiness</span>, every time someone says something to you, all you can do is say, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Sigh, wha</span>t (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さいわ](https://jisho.org/search/さいわ)</span>)? You sigh and say what. Because you're too happy to really listen. You're just sighing all day and not paying attention.
* 幸
* Happiness
* [sound:幸い_b.mp3]
