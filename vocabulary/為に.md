## Mnemonics:

* 
* You move towards the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sake</span>. When you move towards it, you are doing something <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> for the sake of</span>. But why use fancy language like that? Let's just leave it as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> for</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> For the sake of</span> public safety, you will need to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tame</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ため](https://jisho.org/search/ため)</span>) the wild beasts loose in our city. Now go, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tame</span> them!
