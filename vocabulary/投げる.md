## Mnemonics:
ピッチャーがボールを投げたんですけど、ちょうどバッターの前を飛んでいた鳩に当たったんですよね。
* The pitcher threw the ball and it struck a pigeon flying in front of the batter.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> throw</span> so the verb version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to throw</span>.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached, so you can bet it uses the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn this reading with the kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You're at a baseball game watching people <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> throw</span> balls around. But you're hungry so you call for a snack from a vendor. You raise your hand and they throw some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> na</span>chos (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [な](https://jisho.org/search/な)</span>) at you. Oh no! Oh ouch! The nachos are hot and they hit you in the face. The vendor just threw a bunch of hot, sauced nachos at you! WHY?!
