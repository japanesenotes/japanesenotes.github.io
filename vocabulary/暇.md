## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you remember: <br />In your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spare time</span> you like to drink <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hima</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひま](https://jisho.org/search/ひま)</span>), an off brand version of Zima.
