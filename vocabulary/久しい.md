## Mnemonics:
かれが生のきんぎょをたべてしんでから久しい。
* He ate a raw goldfish and has been dead for a long time now.
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> long time</span>? Well, it's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> long time</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> long time</span> ago, in a galaxy far away, a bunch of prequel movies were ruined by a single character. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Heesa</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひさ](https://jisho.org/search/ひさ)</span>) the best character! you hear. Oh no. Heesa here. Get out before Jar Jar Binks gets you! Keep him in the past!
