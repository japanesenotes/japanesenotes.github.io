* I can only cook simple cuisine.
* There is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reason</span> for this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fee</span> that you have to pay to get in here. We are doing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cooking</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cuisine</span> for you to eat while you're watching the show. If we weren't doing cooking, we probably wouldn't charge you this fee!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
