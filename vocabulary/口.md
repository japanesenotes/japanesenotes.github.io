## Mnemonics:
きのうから口がとじられない。
* I haven’t been able to close my mouth since yesterday.
* When a vocab is made up of a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it's generally going to have the same meaning as the kanji it came from. From that, you know this word's meaning is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mouth</span>.
* When a vocab is made up of a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it's generally going to use the kun'yomi reading, which you did not learn from learning the kanji. To remember this word, you should use a mnemonic. With your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mouth</span>, make a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kuchi</span> kuchi kou (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くち](https://jisho.org/search/くち)</span>) sound. Go ahead, make it. Focus on your mouth and try to imagine each shape it makes while zooming in on it. You're talking to a baby, which is why you're making all these ridiculous noises. Also, instead of coo at the end, you're saying kou, because that's the reading of the kanji (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)</span>).<br /><span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くち](https://jisho.org/search/くち)くちこう！くちくちこう！</span> Sounds like something from Arrested Development, actually.
