## Mnemonics:
コウイチは素晴らしい剣道の選手です。
* Koichi is magnificent pro kendo player.
* This is a strange one, but in one way it makes sense. Just make sure you're thinking of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [手](https://jisho.org/search/手)</span> as the word for person, kind of like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [運転手](https://jisho.org/search/運転手)</span> or something along those lines. If you do that, you can say the person that you choose. One situation in which you'd choose a person to do something is in sports. That's why this is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pro athlete</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sports player</span>.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [選](https://jisho.org/search/選)</span> is what you'd expect. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [手](https://jisho.org/search/手)</span> is the on'yomi reading as it is every once in a while, especially when it has to do with representing a person, so you'll have to remember that. I think you've seen <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [手](https://jisho.org/search/手)</span> using this reading enough to be able to remember it, though.
* 選, 手
* Choose, Hand
