## Mnemonics:
おお、ホワイト氏、ちょっと座れば？
* Yo, Mr. White, why don’t you just sit down?
* The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> family name</span> because it goes after a family name in very formal situations. So, it's really closely tied to that. Because only men got the respect back in the day, we're calling this vocab word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mister</span>. You can call me Mr. Koichi if you'd like, too.
* The reading for this word is the same as the kanji.
* 氏
* Family Name
* [sound:〜氏_b.mp3]
* [sound:〜氏_g.mp3]
