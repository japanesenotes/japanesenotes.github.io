## Mnemonics:
フグ: サ…サーモンっ？へーっ...す、すっごく可愛い名前だね。 サーモン: そう思う？ 私はずっと自分の名前があまり好きじゃないんだよね。
* Fugu: S-Salmon...? Wow what a, what a cute name. Salmon: You think so? I’ve always kinda hated it.
* It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> possible</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> love</span> this thing. It's so gosh darn <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cute</span>! Any really cute thing is possible to love.
* The reading for this word is screwed up, though if we're lucky, you already know the word for cute. It seems to have injected itself into American and English culture a decent amount, anyways. If you are one of the lucky ones, you'll know that this word is read as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> かわいい</span>. If you're not, think of the cute thing being a cow. Then you say, that cow<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はいい](https://jisho.org/search/はいい)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かわい](https://jisho.org/search/かわい)</span>), or that cow is good because it's so cute.
* 可, 愛
* Possible, Love
