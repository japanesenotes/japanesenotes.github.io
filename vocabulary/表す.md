## Mnemonics:
このアップルシナモンウィスキーがどれだけ美味しいかを言葉で表すことはできない。
* I can’t begin to express how good this apple cinnamon whiskey is.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> express</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to express</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You're trying not to say it directly, and trying to figure out how <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to express</span> that you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> are a wuss</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あらわす](https://jisho.org/search/あらわす)</span>). Sorry, had to be expressed.
