## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* The reading is different from the one you learned (this is kun'yomi). There's an easy way to remember it, though. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [一人](https://jisho.org/search/一人)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [独り](https://jisho.org/search/独り)</span> share the same readings and mean almost the same thing. Just try to remember that this <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひとり](https://jisho.org/search/ひとり)</span> is used to emphasize solitude and independence.
* 独
* Alone
* [sound:独り_b.mp3]
