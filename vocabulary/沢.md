## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are almost exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This word also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mountain stream</span>. Think of it this way, the water for a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> swamp</span> has to come from somewhere right? It starts out up in the mountains and drains out into a swamp in the valley. The life cycle of a mountain stream into a swamp!
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: The beginning of the word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> swamp</span> is actually pretty similar to this word's reading. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さわ](https://jisho.org/search/さわ)</span> = swa? I'd say it's close enough to make a mnemonic out of in your head.
* 沢
* Swamp
* [sound:沢_b.mp3]
* [sound:沢_g.mp3]
