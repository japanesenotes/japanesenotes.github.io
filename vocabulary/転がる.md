## Mnemonics:
転がる石？イギリスのロックバンド、ザ・ローリング・ストーンズのことですか？
* A rolling stone? Do you mean the English rock band The Rolling Stones?
* You know that the kanji here means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> revolve</span>. The verb version of this is similar. It means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to roll</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to tumble</span>. When something is doing these things it is revolving, right?
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Imagine something rolling down a hill. Inside is a very important uranium <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> core</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ころ](https://jisho.org/search/ころ)</span>) that you need to keep spinning. That's why they have it rolling down hill after hill, because they don't have anything else to keep it spinning like that, preventing it from exploding. This core is very important!
* 転
