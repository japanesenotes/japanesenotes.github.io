## Mnemonics:
わたしは三人子どもがいます。
* I have three children.
* When you see this on a number, for example <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [７人](https://jisho.org/search/７人)</span> or <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [３人](https://jisho.org/search/３人)</span>, you're using it to count people. Just remember, both <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [一人](https://jisho.org/search/一人)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [二人](https://jisho.org/search/二人)</span> have alternative readings. From 3 and up it's just the number plus <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にん](https://jisho.org/search/にん)</span>, like this. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [５人](https://jisho.org/search/５人)</span> is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ごにん](https://jisho.org/search/ごにん)</span>, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [１０人](https://jisho.org/search/１０人)</span> is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゅうにん](https://jisho.org/search/じゅうにん)</span>, etc. This is the counter for people, which makes this word the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> number of people</span>.
* The reading is the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にん](https://jisho.org/search/にん)</span> reading of this kanji. Just think of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> number of people</span>, all <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nin</span>jas, standing there as you count them out.
* 人
* Person
* [sound:〜人_b.mp3]
