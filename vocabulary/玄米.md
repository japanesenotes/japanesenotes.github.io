## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Mysterious</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rice</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> unpolished rice</span>, or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> brown rice</span>. You're used to seeing nice white rice, so seeing rice look any other way is really strange for you.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [米](https://jisho.org/search/米)</span> so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />The biggest problem when you buy <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> unpolished rice</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mic</span>e (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まい](https://jisho.org/search/まい)</span>)! Mice like to eat and sleep in unpolished rice, so you have to be careful when you buy a bag that you get rid of all the sleeping mice before you try to cook it.
