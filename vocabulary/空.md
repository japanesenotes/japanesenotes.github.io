## Mnemonics:
今夜映画E.T.の有名なシーンがちゃんと見れるくらい、空が晴れ渡っているといいんだが。
* I hope the sky tonight is clear enough for us to see the famous scene from the movie E.T.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />In the sky, you are the ruler. You are known as The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soarer</span>! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そら](https://jisho.org/search/そら)</span>). Imagine your theme song and make sure it includes soarer of the sky or something awesome like that.
* 空
