## Mnemonics:
最近、暗いニュースばっかりだけど、こんな暗い世の中でも滅茶苦茶良いことだってあるんだよ。えっと、それで…うーん。何を言いかけたのか忘れちゃったんだけど、とにかく、僕と結婚してくれませんか？
* Everything in the news has been depressing lately, but there is a great big silver lining to this dark cloud, you know. And... well... I kind of lost my train of thought, but, anyway, will you marry me?
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dark</span>? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dark</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You're thrown into something <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dark</span> and small. A lid is closed on top of you, and you are confused. What have you been thrown in? You find out you've been thrown in a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cooler</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くら](https://jisho.org/search/くら)</span>). Feel afraid like you would be if you were thrown in such a dark cooler like this. Is it cold?
