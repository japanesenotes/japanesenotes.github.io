## Mnemonics:
この若者はすごいよ。大物になる前にサインをもらっておいた方がいいよ。
* This young man is terrific. You should get his autograph before he becomes a big-shot.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> young</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> someone</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> young person</span>.
* The reading for this one is a pain. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [若](https://jisho.org/search/若)</span> is the same as what you learned with the kanji (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わか](https://jisho.org/search/わか)</span>), but <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [者](https://jisho.org/search/者)</span> is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もの](https://jisho.org/search/もの)</span>, which isn't what you learned. Think of this: A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> young person</span> does what they want. They don't follow tradition or do anything the way you'd want them to, just like the reading of this word. Also, their actions make you really want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> moan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もの](https://jisho.org/search/もの)</span>) because ugh, young people. Get off my lawn.
* 若, 者
* Young, Someone
* [sound:若者_b.mp3]
* [sound:若者_g.mp3]
