ねえ、煙草って外来語なのに漢字があるって知ってた？
* Hey, did you know that there's kanji for the word tobacco even though it’s a loanword?
* You know the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [外来](https://jisho.org/search/外来)</span> to mean imported. So, combine that with the kanji for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> language</span> and you have an imported word, aka a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> borrowed word</span>. There are a lot of these in Japanese, which makes this word important. Almost everything in katakana is a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [外来](https://jisho.org/search/外来)語</span>, in fact.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 外, 来, 語
* Outside, Come, Language
