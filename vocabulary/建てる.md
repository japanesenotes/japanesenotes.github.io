## Mnemonics:
我が社は、外国の子どもたちに学校を建ててあげるために貯金をしています。
* Our company is saving money to build a school for children in another country.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> build</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to build</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Think about what happens when you build something. What are you doing? You're standing it up. How do you say to stand in Japanese? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> たてる</span>. That's the reading of this word as well. If you think about it they're similar!
* 建
* Build
* [sound:建てる_b.mp3]
* [sound:建てる_g.mp3]
