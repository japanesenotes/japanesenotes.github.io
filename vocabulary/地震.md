## Mnemonics:
「昨夜の地震について話したいんだけど。」「ぜひ聞きたいから話してよ。」
* I want to talk to you about the earthquake last night. I’ll totally listen to what you have to say.
* An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> earth</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> earthquake</span> is just another way to say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> earthquake</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Notice that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [地](https://jisho.org/search/地)</span> is read as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span> instead of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ち](https://jisho.org/search/ち)</span>. You've seen this happen a few times before, so just try to remember that this is the case here.
* 地, 震
* Earth, Earthquake
* [sound:地震_b.mp3]
* [sound:地震_g.mp3]
