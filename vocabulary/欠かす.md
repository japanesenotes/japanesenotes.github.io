* I cannot live without my cell phone.
* Remember how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [欠ける](https://jisho.org/search/欠ける)</span> means to lack? Well this is a stronger version because you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cuss</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かす](https://jisho.org/search/かす)</span>) at the end. So it means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to miss</span>. You're cussing because you aren't just lacking something, you completely missed it: I missed it?! Well $*&amp;%!
