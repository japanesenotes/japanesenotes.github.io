## Mnemonics:
ピンクの月が出たら、出ぱつのあいずだ。
* If the pink moon comes out, that’s our signal to leave.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:<br />Look up at that big, bright moon. You have to open it up and take what's inside. To do that, you are required to have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two key</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つき](https://jisho.org/search/つき)</span>), and they have to be turned at the same time. Imagine you and a friend both turning your keys on opposite sides of the moon to open up the center.
