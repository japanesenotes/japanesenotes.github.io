## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exclude</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to exclude</span>.
* You would like to exclude your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nose</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [のぞ](https://jisho.org/search/のぞ)</span>) because you don't like your nose. Imagine your strong feelings about your nose as you decide to exclude it.
