## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> present time</span>, but when something does present time it is making itself known in the present time. It is showing itself. When it does present time, it causes it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to appear</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to emerge</span> (as in right now, during the present time).
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: It looks like something is going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to appear</span> in front of you. You are so scared and surprised you can't even speak properly: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Are wha</span>t?? (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あらわ](https://jisho.org/search/あらわ)</span>) you ask, trying to figure out what's appearing in front of you.
* 現
