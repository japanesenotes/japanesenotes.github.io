* 
* When one person is in a position to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> judge</span> everyone <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alone</span> by themselves, they're definitely a part of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dictatorship</span>. One person should never be alone to judge everyone because that's how dictators are made and they're not so great.
