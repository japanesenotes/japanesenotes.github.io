## Mnemonics:
その儀式は退屈だったので、たくさん方程式を解いて時間を潰しました。
* The ritual was boring, so I killed time by solving a bunch of equations.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji. In fact, this kanji's on'yomi AND kun'yomi are <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しき](https://jisho.org/search/しき)</span>, so you can never go wrong.
* 式
* Ritual
* [sound:式_b.mp3]
* [sound:式_g.mp3]
