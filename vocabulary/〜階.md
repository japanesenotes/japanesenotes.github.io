## Mnemonics:
このアパートの十三階に住んでいます。
* I live on the thirteenth floor of this apartment.
* You know that the kanji refers to a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> floor</span> (as in the fifth floor). This word represents the version that comes after a number, shown with a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [〜](https://jisho.org/search/〜)</span>. Essentially, this has the same meaning as the kanji you learned, making it nice and easy.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Don't type in the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [〜](https://jisho.org/search/〜)</span> or you'll get it wrong!
* 階
* Floor
* [sound:〜階_b.mp3]
* [sound:〜階_g.mp3]
