## Mnemonics:
お年寄りたちが次から次へと馬から落ちたの、めちゃくちゃ面白いと思うんだけど〜！
* I find it unreasonably funny when old people fall off of horses one after another.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />Imagine someone riding a horse. Who is that person? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Uma</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うま](https://jisho.org/search/うま)</span>) Thurman, the famous actress.
* 馬
* Horse
* [sound:馬_b.mp3]
* [sound:馬_g.mp3]
