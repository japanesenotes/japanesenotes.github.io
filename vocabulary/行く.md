## Mnemonics:
タコベルが無いので火星には行きたくない。
* I wouldn’t want to go to Mars because they don’t have Taco Bell there.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> go</span> so the verb form of this is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to go</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> portion. To remember <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> we use the word eagle. <br />You want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to go</span> somewhere (anywhere!) but you can't. An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>) blocks your path. You try to go forward and it opens its wings and bites at you. You try to go back and it jumps at you. There's nowhere for you to go with this eagle standing there.
