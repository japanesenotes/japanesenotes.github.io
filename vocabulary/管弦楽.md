## Mnemonics:

* 
* You already know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [弦楽](https://jisho.org/search/弦楽)</span> means string music, so add some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pipe</span>s to that, like trumpets and saxophones, and you'll have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> orchestral music</span>. You can't have a whole orchestra with just the string section!
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
* 管, 弦, 楽
