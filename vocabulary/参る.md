## Mnemonics:
私は毎日神社に参ります。
* I visit a Shinto shrine every day.
* The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> participate</span>, so you'd think this word would mean to participate but it doesn't (sorry!). It's a little more complex. Think of it as to participate but where you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to come</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to go</span> in order to do it. This is the humble way to say those things, so you're going to these places with your tail between your legs, just happy you can participate more than anything.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to come</span> to participate! It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> my</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まい](https://jisho.org/search/まい)</span>) lucky day! you exclaim.
* 参
* Participate
* [sound:参る_b.mp3]
* [sound:参る_g.mp3]
