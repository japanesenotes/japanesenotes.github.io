## Mnemonics:
あの店と同じ味のラーメンがどうしても作りたいんだ。
* I want to make ramen that tastes the same as that shop’s no matter what.
* This word is the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> same</span> with hiragana attached. Since the hiragana doesn't suggest it's a verb or adjective, you can assume it's a noun. What's the noun version of same? It's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> same</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />When you think of the word same think <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> same</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> owner</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おな](https://jisho.org/search/おな)</span>). You're looking at a restaurant that has a sign that says, New owners! However, when you walk in you see it's the same terrible owner you remember from before. What a liar.
