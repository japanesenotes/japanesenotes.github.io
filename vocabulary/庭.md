## Mnemonics:
うちには美しい庭があるんだが、隣の人の鶏がいつも花を食べてしまうんだ。
* I have a beautiful garden but my neighbor’s chickens keep eating my flowers.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. You can add the meaning <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yard</span> to your memory bank as well, if you'd like.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You look at your garden. It doesn't meet your expectations so you decide it's time to get a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> newer</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にわ](https://jisho.org/search/にわ)</span>) garden. Tear it all down, folks! Getting a newer garden, here!
* 庭
