## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ascend</span> so the verb vocab version must be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to ascend</span>.
* The reading is the kun'yomi reading, but it's pretty easy. How do you read all the other to climb words? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 登る</span> is one example. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 上る</span> is another. They're all <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [のぼる](https://jisho.org/search/のぼる)</span>, and so is this. Unlike the other climbing words, though, this suggests there's no effort involved. That's why you're ascending and not climbing, because climbing is a bit of work.
* 昇
* Ascend
