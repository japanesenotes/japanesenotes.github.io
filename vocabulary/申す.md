## Mnemonics:
申すまでもなく、私の上司は性転換手術をなされました。今の彼女は大変嬉しいそうだ。
* It goes without saying that my boss underwent a sex change operation. Now she’s very happy.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Say</span> / <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Say Humbly</span>. This is just the verb form, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to say humbly</span>. Please note that this is a very polite and humble way to say to say so it's used in especially polite situations. Because of this, it's probably going to be the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ます](https://jisho.org/search/ます)</span> form, which is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [申します](https://jisho.org/search/申します)</span>. You can also call this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to say</span> as well, just remember that it's humble and polite!
* The reading for this kanji is the kun'yomi reading, but that's the reading you learned with the kanji. High Fives.
* 申
* Say Humbly
