* My husband was fired, but I’m surprisingly calm.
* You have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flat</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> energy</span>. What kind of energy would be a flat one? Probably a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cool</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> calm</span> one. You'd also tell people about this flat energy by saying you are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> all right</span> or just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> okay</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
