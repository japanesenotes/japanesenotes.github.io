* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. Since this is a body part, the kun'yomi reading usually takes priority. That means you learned the kun'yomi reading already when you learned the kanji.
