## Mnemonics:

* 
* This has a similar meaning to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [主人]([主](https://jisho.org/search/主)人)</span> (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> head of household</span>), but we're mainly learning it so you can learn some other vocab later on. You can remember it also as the meaning you learned with the kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [主](https://jisho.org/search/主)</span>, which is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> master</span>.
* The reading is of course different from what you learned with the kanji. Think of this: The person who was your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> head of household</span> was very strict. Anytime you did anything that was incorrect or bad, he/she would pull out the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> noose</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぬし](https://jisho.org/search/ぬし)</span>), but would call it a noosey to be cute, since you were just a kid.
