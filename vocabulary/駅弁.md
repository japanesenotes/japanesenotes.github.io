## Mnemonics:
あっ、おにぎりを持ってくるのを忘れたの？じゃあ、お昼は駅弁を買わなくちゃいけませんね。
* Oh, you forgot to bring the onigiri? We’ll have to buy a station bento for lunch.
* Remember how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [弁当]([弁](https://jisho.org/search/弁)当)</span> is bento? Well, the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [弁](https://jisho.org/search/弁)</span> in this word comes from that, so pretend it means bento. Then, when you have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> train station</span> to go along with the bento, you have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> train station bento</span>. As you might think, a train station bento is just a bento that's sold at a train station. Easy!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 駅, 弁
* Station, Dialect
