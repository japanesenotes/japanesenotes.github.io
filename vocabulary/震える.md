## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> earthquake</span> so the verb means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to shiver</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to shake</span>, like you would if there was an earthquake happening right now.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You start <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to shake</span> in an earthquake because you're really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> full</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふる](https://jisho.org/search/ふる)</span>) from eating lunch. Now your full belly is shaking and quaking with the ground! Ahh it's awful! You never want to be full again!
