## Mnemonics:
皆さん、お早うございます。今日は、皆さんに、茄子を食べることの危険性について教えたいと思います。
* Good morning, class. Today I’m going to teach you about the dangers of eating eggplant.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> teach</span> so the verb vocab version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to teach</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Think about your favorite teacher. Now think about him/her teaching you the following: Today I'm going to teach you about the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ocea</span>n (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おし](https://jisho.org/search/おし)</span>). It is big. Really big. Inside it are krakens, space aliens, and lost cities. <br />Here is where you continue the lesson in your head, making it the most ridiculous lesson about the ocean you've ever heard. Focus in on the ocean part, since that's the reading, always coming back to it.
