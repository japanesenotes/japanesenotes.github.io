## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: If you think of the tide, you think of the ocean. If you think of the ocean and what it's filled with (besides water) you think of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> salt</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しお](https://jisho.org/search/しお)</span>).
* 潮
* Tide
* [sound:潮_b.mp3]
