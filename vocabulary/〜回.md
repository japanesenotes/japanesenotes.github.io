## Mnemonics:
何回砂を食べたか自分でも数えきれないよ。
* I can’t count the number of times I’ve eaten sand.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* The reading is the on'yomi reading which you learned with the kanji. This is probably because this word gets attached to numbers usually, which makes it behave more like jukugo. So, you can have <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [１回](https://jisho.org/search/１回)</span>, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [２回](https://jisho.org/search/２回)</span>, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [３回](https://jisho.org/search/３回)</span>, or even <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [１００回](https://jisho.org/search/１００回)</span> if you're into that sort of thing.
* 回
* Times
* [sound:〜回_b.mp3]
* [sound:〜回_g.mp3]
