## Mnemonics:

* 
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lifespan</span> is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fate</span> and will show you how long your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lifespan</span> is.
* You did learn the reading of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [寿](https://jisho.org/search/寿)</span>, but the reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [命](https://jisho.org/search/命)</span> is an exception. When you think of a lifespan, think of how that affects everyone. Me, you... well, just those things. Combine them both into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> myou</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みょう](https://jisho.org/search/みょう)</span>). That is who the lifespan affects. Myou!
* 寿, 命
* Lifespan, Fate
