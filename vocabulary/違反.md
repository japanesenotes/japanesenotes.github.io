## Mnemonics:

* 
* If you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> anti-</span> something in a way that's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> different</span> from the norm then you'll be in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> violation</span> of the law! The laws that the not different people made. Either way, those people will give you a hard time for your anti-stance against the thing they like, and say it's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> transgression</span>.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [違](https://jisho.org/search/違)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />If you find yourself in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> violation</span> of the law just pull out your pet <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>). Eagles are so majestic, they'll forget all about your transgression and let you go. If you're going to go be anti-something make sure you bring that eagle. People seem to care more about animals than other people like that.
