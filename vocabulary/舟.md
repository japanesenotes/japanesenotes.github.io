## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Note that this word isn't usually used by itself (that would be <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [船](https://jisho.org/search/船)</span>). It's usually attached to things that are boat-related, but I wanted you to learn it individually so you can use it that way.
* The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji. Also the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [船](https://jisho.org/search/船)</span>.
* 舟
* Boat
* [sound:舟_b.mp3]
* [sound:舟_g.mp3]
