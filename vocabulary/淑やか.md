## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />If you're trying to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> graceful</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> polite</span> you have to cut certain words out of your vocabulary. The number one being <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sh*t</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しと](https://jisho.org/search/しと)</span>). You can't say you need to go take a sh*t during an international conference or a fancy dinner! You need to be modest and not use that word, geez.
