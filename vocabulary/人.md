## Mnemonics:
人びとは、かれをばかな人だという。
* People say he's a stupid person.
* When a vocab is a single kanji all alone, it usually has the same meaning as its kanji parent. That goes for this vocab word as well. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Person</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> person</span>.
* When a vocab is a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji), it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Since you don't know the kun'yomi reading for this kanji yet, let's use a mnemonic to learn it.<br />What does a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> person</span> hate more than anything? They hate extreme <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> heat</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひと](https://jisho.org/search/ひと)</span>). You can always put on more clothes to stay warm, but when the heat gets too high, you can only take off so much.
* 人
