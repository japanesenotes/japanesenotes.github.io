## Mnemonics:
虫歯がいっぱいあるんだけど、歯科保険が無いので、治療代を捻出することができないんだ。
* I have so many cavities but I don’t have dental insurance and I can’t afford to get them treated.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tooth</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bug</span>... Luckily, it's not some bug living in your tooth, though you can see why someone might think this is what happens. A tooth with a bug in it is a tooth with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cavity</span>.
* The readings are both kun'yomi, but those are the readings you learned with these kanji. Notice that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span> turns to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ば](https://jisho.org/search/ば)</span>, though. Presumably this is because you might yell out BAH! when you find out you have a cavity.
* 虫, 歯
* Insect, Tooth
* [sound:虫歯_b.mp3]
* [sound:虫歯_g.mp3]
