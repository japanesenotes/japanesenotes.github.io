## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> delicate</span>, and the vocab has this meaning too. It's that kind of subtle delicate, not so much that something will break (like it is with the kanji). Something that is a bit <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> faint</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> indistinct</span> is going to be delicate in this sense, perhaps, too.
* If you're going to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cuss</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かす](https://jisho.org/search/かす)</span>) up a storm, that's not really being <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> delicate</span>.
* 微
* Delicate
