## Mnemonics:
そのサーカス団は、開演してすぐに観客の心を捉えた。
* Immediately after the show started, the circus troupe captivated the audience's hearts.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> catch</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to catch</span>.<br />Try to remember the mnemonic from the kanji with this one, because this word isn't used for physically catching things, but for ideas or meanings that you are able <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to grasp</span>, metaphorically speaking.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading with the kanji, so you should be able to read it already!
