## Mnemonics:
すみません、 前を通らせてもらってもよろしいでしょうか。あの梅干しが入った小瓶を買いたいので。
* Excuse me. May I get through? I’d like to buy that jar of pickled plums.
* This is a food pretty specific to Japan, making it a slightly weird one to learn. You have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Japanese Plum</span>. Then you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dry</span>. So when the Japanese plum is dried, it's not a dried plum (that would be too easy), it is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pickled plum</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pickled ume</span>. If you know the name of this food, you can call it by that too: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> umeboshi</span>.
* The reading for this one, like the meaning, is kind of strange. It's the kun'yomi readings, so apologies in advance for that. You have <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うめ](https://jisho.org/search/うめ)</span> plus <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼし](https://jisho.org/search/ぼし)</span>, which comes from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [干す]([干](https://jisho.org/search/干)す)</span> though the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span> is stuffed inside the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [干](https://jisho.org/search/干)</span> for some reason. It's also rendaku'd. Basically, everything is all screwed up, so you know, deal with it. This food is awesome, and common, so you have to learn it. I guess the pickling process has mangled the reading of this word. At least it tastes good.
