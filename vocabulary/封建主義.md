## Mnemonics:

* 
* You know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [主義](https://jisho.org/search/主義)</span> is -ism. Add that onto an ism that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> build</span>ing a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seal(ed) in</span> system, and you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> feudalism</span>. Why? Because with feudalism, power is sealed in with one group or one family. Nobody else can get in (until they are overthrown, anyways), making this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> feudalism</span>.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
* 封, 建, 主, 義
* Seal, Build, Master, Righteousness
