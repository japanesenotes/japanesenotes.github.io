## Mnemonics:
私の一番好きなテレビ番組は、「黒い画面」です。この番組は、停電になった時だけ放送されます。
* My favorite channel on TV is called Black Screen. It only airs when the power goes off.
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> black</span>? It's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> black</span>. Special Note: The noun version of black also exists in Japanese. It is just <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [黒](https://jisho.org/search/黒)</span> with the same pronunciation, but minus the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> which makes it adjective-tastic.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Think of black things. One very common black thing is the common <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crow</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くろ](https://jisho.org/search/くろ)</span>). Associate those two together.
