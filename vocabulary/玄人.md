## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mysterious</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> person</span> is really really good at what they do. So good that they aren't exactly sure what is it they do, but you know they're definitely an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> expert</span> at whatever it is.
* This reading for this word is mysteriously an exception (sorry). So here's a mnemonic to help:<br />If you're such an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> expert</span> you should be able to tell what anything is if someone asks you. Even this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crow toe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くろうと](https://jisho.org/search/くろうと)</span>). Crow toes are pretty hard to recognize, unless you're a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> professional</span> crow guy. But I guess you are, huh?
* 玄, 人
