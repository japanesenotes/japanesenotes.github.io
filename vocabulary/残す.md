## Mnemonics:
昨夜Tofuguオフィスに泥棒が入り、Tofuguステッカーを何枚か盗んで行ったのですが、馬鹿な泥棒たちは、指紋を残すという初歩的な過ちも犯しました。
* Thieves broke into the Tofugu office and stole some of our stickers last night, but they were so stupid that they made the elementary mistake of leaving behind their fingerprints.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> remainder</span>, but you can't really to remainder. What is something that's similar that would make sense? How about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to leave behind</span>. This is when you're actually doing the leaving behind too. For example, you eat some food and you leave behind your rice because you're a bad child. You can remember this because of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span>. Every time you leave some food behind your mom would <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue</span> you, because she was a terrible mom. Imagine this.
* The reading for this word can come from level 14 item <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [残る](https://jisho.org/search/残る)</span>. Associate the two in your mind and you'll be able to read both.
* 残
* Remainder
* [sound:残す_b.mp3]
* [sound:残す_g.mp3]
