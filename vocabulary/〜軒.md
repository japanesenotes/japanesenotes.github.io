## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This can be used to count houses and buildings, which is good because you never know which buildings have people living in them like they're houses.
* This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
* 軒
* House Counter
