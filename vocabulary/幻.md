## Mnemonics:
恍惚状態の中でサーモンの幻を何度も見た後に、フグはようやく彼女が12年前に死んだことを思い出し、自分が幻を見ていたことに気づいた。
* After a series of ecstasy filled visions of Salmon, Fugu finally remembered she had been dead for 12 years, and he realized he was seeing an illusion.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. You can add <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> phantom</span> to the meanings as well, because phantoms are kind of like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> illusion</span>s.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You look up to see a crazy <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> illusion</span>. You can't believe it's real. Master Roshi, from Dragonball, is standing in front of you (you thought he was a cartoon!). Then, he splits into a million versions of himself, creating a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mob of Roshi</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まぼろし](https://jisho.org/search/まぼろし)</span>). This mob goes on to train many people to fight.
