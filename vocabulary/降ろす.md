## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. You already learned that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [降りる](https://jisho.org/search/降りる)</span> means to get off. This is when you're helping something else descend down from something, not when you yourself are getting down. So it means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to take down</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to lower</span>.
* This word uses the kun'yomi reading, which you already learned. Go you!
* 降
* Descend
* [sound:降ろす_b.mp3]
* [sound:降ろす_g.mp3]
