* I don’t know if I can lick my elbow, but I’ll give it a try.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attempt</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> try</span>. The verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to attempt</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to try out</span>. Why don't you try out the meaning of this verb, while you're at it?
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Okay. Here's the deal. We have this wild animal. I want you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to attempt</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tame</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ため](https://jisho.org/search/ため)</span>) it.
