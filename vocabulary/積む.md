## Mnemonics:

* 
* 積もる is to accumulate. Now you're doing the accumulating, and in order to do that you must go <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to pile things up</span>. More and more and more. How do you know that this verb is when you're doing the accumulating? It's because you are piling up cows (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> む</span>). Wow, a cow piler.
* The reading comes from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [積もる](https://jisho.org/search/積もる)</span>, so pile up your knowledge and remember it that way.
* 積
* Accumulate
