* Remember how you learned that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [埋める](https://jisho.org/search/埋める)</span> means to bury? Well this is something that is being buried, maybe even you! Either way, you're not the one doing the burying. It means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be buried</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading when you learned the kanji, so you should be able to read it already!
