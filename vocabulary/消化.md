## Mnemonics:
昼に食べたラーメンをまだ消化しきっていない。
* I haven’t finished digesting the ramen I ate for lunch.
* What is something that will first <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> extinguish</span> something and then <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> change</span> it? One thing I can think of is your body. It takes in food, extinguishes it in your stomach, then changes it into things your body can use (and then excrete). That's why this extinguish-change process is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> digestion</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 消, 化
* Extinguish, Change
* [sound:消化_b.mp3]
