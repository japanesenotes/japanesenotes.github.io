* 
* When you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> raise</span> something you are causing it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to rise</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: The reading for this is the same as the other to rise word, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [上がる](https://jisho.org/search/上がる)</span>. Nice how that works, right? So, just associate the two and you have yourself a reading.

* Raise
