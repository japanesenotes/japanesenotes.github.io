## Mnemonics:
この電車は、Tofuguオフィス行きです。
* This train is bound for Tofugu Office Station.
* This is a weird word. Call it exceptional. You'll see this at train stations, especially. You know the kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> go</span>. So, something is going somewhere. Now just use the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span> to help you to remember that this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> train direction</span> (aka it tells you which direction a train is going), because this word is the key (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>) to you knowing what direction you're going in so you don't get lost. You could also remember this word as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bound for</span> aka Bound for Tokyo Station.
* The reading is also an exception. It can be <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いき](https://jisho.org/search/いき)</span>, but instead we're focusing on the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆき]([ゆ](https://jisho.org/search/ゆ)き)</span> reading. You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆ](https://jisho.org/search/ゆ)</span> portion, so think of it this way: <br />Just think about the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> train direction</span> that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> you</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆ](https://jisho.org/search/ゆ)</span>) need to go in. It's all about you. Not your friends or anyone else. You. You are the most important person at this train station.
