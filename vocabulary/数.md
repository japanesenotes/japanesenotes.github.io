## Mnemonics:
この映画には、数々の日本映画のお兄ちゃん役で知られているコウイチが、数を数えるのが得意な数学教師の役で出演しています。
* In this movie, the role of the math teacher who is good at counting is played by Koichi, who is known for playing the role of numerous older brother figures in countless Japanese films.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />Imagine yourself <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> count</span>ing by playing a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kazoo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かず](https://jisho.org/search/かず)</span>). Each number you count, you toot your kazoo. How fun!
