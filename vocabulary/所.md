## Mnemonics:
七十二回も同じ所を歩いているので、私達は道に迷ったんだと思います。
* I think we’re lost because we’ve walked by the same place 72 times now.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />Here's the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> place</span>! Either you have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> talk or row</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ところ](https://jisho.org/search/ところ)</span>). If you talk, maybe you can talk your way out of this problem you're in. If you row, you may be able to escape. Either way, this is the place for it.
