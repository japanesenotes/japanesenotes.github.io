## Mnemonics:
男は、女性の自転車が完璧に壊れているのを見て、「町まで車に乗せてあげるよ」と言った。
* The man saw that the woman’s bicycle was completely destroyed so he offered to give her a ride back to town.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ride</span> so this word has to do with riding. There's another word that's similar (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [乗る](https://jisho.org/search/乗る)</span> which means to ride). This particular one means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to give a ride</span>. Use the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せ](https://jisho.org/search/せ)</span> as a hint. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せ](https://jisho.org/search/せ)</span> is a sail (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せ](https://jisho.org/search/せ)</span>) that you use on your boat to give someone a ride. How nice of you.
* The reading is kun'yomi (see that hiragana?) but that's the reading you learned with the kanji so you should be okay with this. Allow me to give you a ride to the next item to study.
* 乗
* Ride
