## Mnemonics:
彼女は先日からずっと病気で寝ていると嘘をついた。
* She was lying about being sick in bed for a few days.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> previous</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> day</span> isn't necessarily yesterday. It can be any recent day, which is why this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> the other day</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Note that the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [日](https://jisho.org/search/日)</span> reading is the alternate reading, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じつ](https://jisho.org/search/じつ)</span>.
* 先, 日
* Previous, Sun
* [sound:先日_b.mp3]
