コウイチが実はとある秘密の国の王子様で、のっぴきならない理由のためポートランドオレゴンで身分を隠してTofuguの社長として生きているという奇妙な葉書を受け取った。
* I received a weird postcard saying that Koichi is actually the prince of a secret country, but he is living incognito as the Tofugu president in Portland, Oregon for some unavoidable reason.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> writing</span> that you put on a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> leaf</span> is like something else. Instead of a leaf, think about writing you put on a leafish sized item. A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> postcard</span> perhaps?
* The reading is kind of weird, sorry. The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [葉](https://jisho.org/search/葉)</span> is the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span> you know and love. Then, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [書](https://jisho.org/search/書)</span> is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かき](https://jisho.org/search/かき)</span> despite not having a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span> on the end like you'd expect. So, it's weird. It's shortened like a postcard is a shortened letter, I suppose? Technically it is the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [書](https://jisho.org/search/書)き</span> reading, but keep in mind that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [書](https://jisho.org/search/書)き</span> gets rendaku'd.
* 葉, 書
* Leaf, Write
