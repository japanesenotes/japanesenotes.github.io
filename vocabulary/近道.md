「ありえねぇ！お前って本当脳みそ無いのな。なんで一方通行を逆走してるんだよ。」「近道になると思ったんだよ。」
* Oh my God! You are such an airhead! Why are we going down a one-way street? I thought it would be a shortcut!
* Taking the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nearby</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> road</span> will get you to your destination more quickly (because it's more close by!). This is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shortcut</span>, aka the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> short way</span>.
* The reading is a bit weird in this one. Its kun'yomi reading for both kanji, even though it looks just like it should be all on'yomi reading. It's like you're taking a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shortcut</span> with your kanji readings and doing the native Japanese readings (kun'yomi) instead of the more intellectual Chinese ones (on'yomi). Luckily, you've hopefully seen both of these kanji as vocab already. You have <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちか](https://jisho.org/search/ちか)</span> for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [近](https://jisho.org/search/近)</span> (short for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [近](https://jisho.org/search/近)い</span>) and you have <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [道](https://jisho.org/search/道)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みち](https://jisho.org/search/みち)</span>), just like the word street you learned before. Combine these together and you have the reading for this word. Perhaps it's like this because you're combining a couple concepts together into one word, at least when it comes to short + way.
* 近, 道
* Near, Road
