* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> difficult</span>? It's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> difficult</span>.

Click. Boom!
