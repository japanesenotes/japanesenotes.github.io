## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Barbarian</span>s who live in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> field</span>s, not even in huts or houses or anything, are called <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> savage</span> by people who DO live in huts and houses. They think if you live out in a field you're really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> uncivilized</span>. But that's all a matter of opinion, I guess.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
