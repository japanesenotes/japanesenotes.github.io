## Mnemonics:
私の町は、最高のエアギターを作ることで有名です。
* My town is famous for making the best invisible guitars.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />You walk into this town. You hate it (because it's vocab, and who doesn't hate vocab?). So what do you do? You pull out a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> match</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まち](https://jisho.org/search/まち)</span>) and burn this town to the ground. Whoa, you some kind of psycho?
* 町
* Town
* [sound:町_b.mp3]
* [sound:町_g.mp3]
