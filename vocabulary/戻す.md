## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> return</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to return</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to return something</span>. You know you're doing the action of returning someone or something because when you do, they just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span>) you because you broke the thing you were supposed to return before returning it.
* The reading is the same as what you learned with the kanji.
* 戻
* Return
