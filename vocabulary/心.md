## Mnemonics:
もしアンパンマンがれいこくな心をもっていたらどうしよう。
* I wouldn’t know what to do if Anpanman had a cruel heart.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />Imagine a giant <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> heart</span> sitting in a rowing boat. It's also drinking cocoa. Focus on all three of these parts and associate them into one story / memory. Once you've done that, sing the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cocoa row</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こころ](https://jisho.org/search/こころ)</span>) song! I don't know what that song is, but I want you to make one up and actually sing it, out loud. If you do, I bet you won't forget this word's reading too easily.
* 心
* Heart
* [sound:心_b.mp3]
* [sound:心_g.mp3]
