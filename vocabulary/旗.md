## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />The one with the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flag</span> is the Mad <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Hatter</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はた](https://jisho.org/search/はた)</span>). Just imagine looking through a group of people. You have to find the Mad Hatter, and he has to find you. That's why he offered to wear a flag on his hat.
