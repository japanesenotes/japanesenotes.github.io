## Mnemonics:
その男はゆっくりと俺に銃口を向けた。
* The man slowly pointed the muzzle of the gun at me.
* You know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [向く](https://jisho.org/search/向く)</span> means to face or to turn toward - so, this is a different version of that. This is when someone turns or points something, but you aren't turning. That's why it means to turn (something) towards and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to point</span>. <br />In order to remember that this particular word means to turn (something) towards, focus on the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [け](https://jisho.org/search/け)</span>. You have a bottle of ketchup in your hands and you're turning it toward your worst enemy to spray them. Picture yourself pointing the ketchup toward them.
* The reading for this one is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [向く](https://jisho.org/search/向く)</span> which you learned in a previous level. As long as you know that one you should be able to learn this one's reading as well.
* 向
* Yonder
* [sound:向ける_b.mp3]
* [sound:向ける_g.mp3]
