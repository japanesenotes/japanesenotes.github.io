## Mnemonics:
この町が平和を取り戻したことについて、スパイダーマンにお礼を言いたい。
* I’d like to thank Spider-Man for taking back the streets and making our city safe again.
* The meaning of this word is the same as the kanji, except it has an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)</span> before it, which just makes the thing you're saying elevate the other person more. Basically, it's more polite and awesome.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
* 礼
* Thanks
