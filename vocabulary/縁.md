## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Things left near the edge tend to fall off. Remember the old Koichidamus proverb, Only a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foo</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>) leaves his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cheese</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ち](https://jisho.org/search/ち)</span>) on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> edge</span> of a table.
