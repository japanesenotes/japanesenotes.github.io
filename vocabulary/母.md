## Mnemonics:
母はとうふとふぐがすきだ。
* My mother likes tofu and fugu.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This is the polite and humble form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mother</span>. You use this when you're talking about your own mother to other people, especially if you aren't very close to them.
* The reading is the kun'yomi reading, but this is the reading you learned with the kanji. Just remember, your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mother</span> is a terrible person and won't stop laughing at you: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> HA HA</span> HA HA HA!
* 母
* Mother
