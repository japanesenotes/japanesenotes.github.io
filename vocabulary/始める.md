## Mnemonics:
生地をフライパンに流し始める前に、材料を全て混ぜる必要があります。
* You need to mix all the ingredients together before you can start transferring the batter to the pans.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> start</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to start something</span>.<br />This is a transitive verb. That means it takes a direct object. You start something. Like studying! You should have started studying earlier though, huh?
* Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />Right now it's time <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to begin</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Haj</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はじ](https://jisho.org/search/はじ)</span>). (Haj is the fifth pillar of Islam, and is a pilgrimage to Mecca during the month of Dhu al-Hijja). You need to start Haj right now!
