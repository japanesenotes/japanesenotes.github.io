## Mnemonics:

* 
* When you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> go</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> carry out</span> something, you are carrying it out. That's why this is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> carry out</span> (that is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しこう](https://jisho.org/search/しこう)</span>). Alternatively, when you go carry out something, you are making sure something is getting done. You are doing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> enforcement</span> on that thing that you're carrying out on.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Another alternative reading is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せこう](https://jisho.org/search/せこう)</span>, which is more often used when talking about something law related.
* 施, 行
* Carry Out, Go
