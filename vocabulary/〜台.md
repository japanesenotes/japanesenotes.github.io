## Mnemonics:
あのかねもちしゃちょうはこうきゅうしゃを三台もっています。
* The rich company president has three luxury cars.
* This counter is used with some kind of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> machine</span> or device, usually a fairly large one (so nothing itty bitty). Cars are a good example of this. But it can also be used for things like computers, which were once the size of rooms, but are now nice and small. Thanks technology!
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Be sure to omit the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [〜](https://jisho.org/search/〜)</span> in your answer as it is only a placeholder for a number.
* 台
* Machine
* [sound:〜台_b.mp3]
