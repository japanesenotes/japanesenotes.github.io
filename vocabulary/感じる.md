## Mnemonics:
最近兄に冷たくされていると感じます。
* I feel like my older brother has been giving me the cold shoulder recently.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> feeling</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to feel</span>.
* Guess what? Even though this would use the vocab kun'yomi reading, usually, the readings for both on'yomi and kun'yomi on this kanji are the same, meaning you can read this word no matter what. Feeling better now?
* 感
* Feeling
* [sound:感じる_b.mp3]
* [sound:感じる_g.mp3]
