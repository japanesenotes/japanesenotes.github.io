## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* The reading for this word is an exception. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember it:<br />You notice a lot of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neglect</span> when it comes to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> o</span>ld <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ro</span>ad <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> so</span>ap <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>rs (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おろそか](https://jisho.org/search/おろそか)</span>). If you drive down the old road you'll see neglected cars made of soap all over the place. It's sad, really.
