## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> freight</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thing</span>s <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ship</span> is a boat that freights things. It's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> freighter</span>.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [物](https://jisho.org/search/物)</span> takes its <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もつ](https://jisho.org/search/もつ)</span> reading, which makes sense since it sounds like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [持つ](https://jisho.org/search/持つ)</span>, which is to hold. What is this freighter doing? It's holding freight! So, that's how you can remember that bit.
* 貨, 物, 船
* Freight, Thing, Boat
