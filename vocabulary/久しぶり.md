## Mnemonics:
久しぶり！とあったことのない人にいわれた。
* I was told long time no see by a person that I had never met before.
* This is kind of a set phrase in Japanese, though we're going to treat it like a vocab word here (because it's so common and useful!). You know that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [久](https://jisho.org/search/久)</span></span> means long time - so now let's pay attention to the kana: <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しぶり](https://jisho.org/search/しぶり)</span>. Just imagine that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> she buri</span>ed you alive, then a few days later came back to dig you up. The first thing she says is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> LONG TIME NO SEE!</span>
* You learned this reading when you learned <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [久](https://jisho.org/search/久)しい</span>. It's the same one!
* 久
* Long Time
