## Mnemonics:

* 
* So this doesn't quite make sense in terms of the meaning of the kanji... but you'll be okay. This means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> on purpose</span>. Perhaps when you do something that has the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb">  appearance</span> of doing what you wanted to do you're doing it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> on purpose</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You did that to me <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> on purpose</span>? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Whaza</span>pp with that?
