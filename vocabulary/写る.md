## Mnemonics:
この写真に写っている男の人は、私のファーストキスです。
* The guy in this picture was my first kiss.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> copy</span>, but what is a copy? It is basically a photograph, which is why this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be photographed</span>. You know this one is to be photographed because it ends with a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span>. Someone thinks you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ru</span>de so they're photographing you.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)つ</span> part. You're being rude, right? That's why you got photographed. Why are you rude? You're doing beatboxing, constantly saying <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)つうつうつ</span> over and over again. Say it out loud, too.
