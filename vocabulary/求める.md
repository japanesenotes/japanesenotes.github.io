## Mnemonics:
Tofuguの顧客は、ますます環境に優しい日本語学習製品を求めるようになってきている。
* Increasingly, Tofugu clients are demanding environmentally friendly Japanese learning products.
* What's the verb form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> request</span>? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to request</span>. It also is for when you want something (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to want</span>), because when you request something you probably want it.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: What is it that you want? You want a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> moat</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もと](https://jisho.org/search/もと)</span>) around your home. Your neighbor's cats keep pooping on your lawn, but if you had a moat they wouldn't be able to get to your lawn in the first place, since cats hate water (and alligators). You request a moat!
* 求
* Request
