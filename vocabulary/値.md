## Mnemonics:

* 
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> value</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> value</span>, though it's also the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> price</span>.
* If you want to find out how much <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> value</span> a horse has, you just have to make it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neigh</span>. If the horse can't neigh, you know you can lower the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> price</span> you were going to pay. This works with other things you want to buy too. Don't spend too much on a pair of socks or sunglasses if they can't neigh. #Lifehack
