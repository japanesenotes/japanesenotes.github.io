* During my afternoon nap I sleep on my side.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Please note that this word refers to the side of something. Not the right side, for example. That would be <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [右側](https://jisho.org/search/右側)</span>.
* The reading for this vocab is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, lucky you!
