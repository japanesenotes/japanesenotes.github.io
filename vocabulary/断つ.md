## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cut off</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to cut off</span>. Don't confuse this with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [断る](https://jisho.org/search/断る)</span> which means to refuse. You know this is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to cut off</span> because of the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>, which hints that you have had <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>) too many chocolates, and it's time to cut you off.
* URGH! The reading isn't even the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [断る](https://jisho.org/search/断る)</span>, how frustrating. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> To Cut Off</span> is read as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> たつ</span>. Instead of eating too many chocolates and getting cut off, maybe you're eating too many tater <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tots</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たつ](https://jisho.org/search/たつ)</span>). Don't eat so many of those, it's unhealthy. You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to cut off</span> tater tots from your diet so you don't get fat.
