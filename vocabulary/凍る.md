## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> frozen</span>, so the vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to freeze</span>.
* The reading actually comes from the word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 氷</span>, which means ice. You can kind of see where the origins of these words come from, now... really cold frozen things. So, think back to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こおり](https://jisho.org/search/こおり)</span>, then change the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [り](https://jisho.org/search/り)</span> to a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span> and put it outside the kanji. That makes the reading for this <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こおる](https://jisho.org/search/こおる)</span>, in all (or most) of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [氷](https://jisho.org/search/氷)</span>'s glory.
