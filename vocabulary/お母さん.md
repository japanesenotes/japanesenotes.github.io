## Mnemonics:
お母さんのはなげはながい。
* My mom’s nose hair is long.
* This word starts with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)</span> which makes it more polite. Then, there's the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [母](https://jisho.org/search/母)</span></span> which you know means mother. Last, there's the honorific <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さん](https://jisho.org/search/さん)</span> which further adds respect (to the mother). So, this is the nice way to say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mother</span>. You use it when you're talking to your own <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mom</span> or talking about her with friends. You can also use this when you're talking about your friends' moms.<br />If you need to talk about someone's mother that you don't really know, or you aren't close to, you'll want to use <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)母様</span>, instead. Don't worry, you'll learn that last kanji in a few lessons. Until then, it's pronounced, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)かあさま</span>. Kay?
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かあ](https://jisho.org/search/かあ)</span> portion. Here's a mnemonic to help you to remember it: <br />What does your super nice <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mother</span> do for you (this is why you're so polite to her!)? She drives you all around in her <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> car</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かあ](https://jisho.org/search/かあ)</span>) taking you wherever you need to go... soccer, kendo, whatever. What a nice mother you have!
