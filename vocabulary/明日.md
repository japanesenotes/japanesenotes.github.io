## Mnemonics:
一ヶ月イタリアに行くことを知らせるために、明日学校に電話しなくてはいけません。
* I need to call the school tomorrow to inform them that I’m going to Italy for a month.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bright</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> day</span> isn't today (because today was terrible), it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tomorrow</span>, because you can always look to tomorrow to be a better, brighter day.
* The reading makes no sense at all. You have to learn it straight up, and can't rely on the kanji it's made from. Why is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tomorrow</span> going to be such a bright and awesome day? Because you're making <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ash ta</span>cos for dinner, and that's your favorite. Imagine imagining tomorrow, full of ash tacos and deliciousness. Maybe you could use some of those Dorito taco shells?<br />A note about the other two readings <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あす](https://jisho.org/search/あす)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みょうにち](https://jisho.org/search/みょうにち)</span>: <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あす](https://jisho.org/search/あす)</span> is used in the news and in weather reports, and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みょうにち](https://jisho.org/search/みょうにち)</span> is really only used in business, so you should really only be using <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あした](https://jisho.org/search/あした)</span> for now. But it's good to know that the other two readings exist!
* 明, 日
* Bright, Sun
* [sound:明日_b.mp3]
* [sound:明日_g.mp3]
