## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> different</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be different</span>... and of course, to be different is also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be wrong</span> in Japan. Don't be different!
* The reading is the same as the reading you learned with the kanji. It's not different at all.
* 違
* Different
