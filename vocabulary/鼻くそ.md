## Mnemonics:
フグが僕のことを自分勝手だって責めるんだ。目くそ鼻くそを笑うだよね。
* Fugu accused me of being selfish. Talk about an eye crust laughing at a booger.
* Maybe you didn't know this, but if you're like everyone else learning a new language, you learn the cuss words first. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くそ](https://jisho.org/search/くそ)</span> is sh*t / garbage, though it's not really a bad word in Japanese like it is in English. So, what is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nose</span> sh*t? It's your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> snot</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boogers</span>. Ewwww, stop eating them!
* The reading is just like what you learned with the kanji. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> はなくそ</span>.
* 鼻
* Nose
* [sound:鼻くそ_b.mp3]
* [sound:鼻くそ_g.mp3]
