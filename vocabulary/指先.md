## Mnemonics:
指先がかじかんでいます。
* My fingertips are getting numb with cold.
* You know that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> previous</span> part of your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> finger</span>? The part I just chopped off? Well that was your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fingertip</span>! I only had time to get the tip. It used to be on your finger and now it's right here, in my hand. Sorry, I guess. Oh, but don't worry, I'll even things out and get the tip of your toe real quick too.
* This word uses the kun'yomi readings from both kanji, probably because it includes body parts. You know them both already, so now you know this too!
* 指, 先
* Finger, Previous
* [sound:指先_b.mp3]
