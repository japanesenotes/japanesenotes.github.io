## Mnemonics:
彼は、彼女が視界から完全に消えるまで、さようならと手を振り続けた。
* He waved goodbye until she completely disappeared from view.
* You've seen that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [消す](https://jisho.org/search/消す)</span> is to extinguish. So, this is another verb version of that. This time, you're not doing the extinguishing, it's just happening. Something is going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to disappear</span> on its own. How can you differentiate this from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [消す](https://jisho.org/search/消す)</span>? Well, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [える](https://jisho.org/search/える)</span> allows you to notice how the object disappeared into thin <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> air</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [える](https://jisho.org/search/える)</span>). You know you didn't do it, so it disappeared on its own, making it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to disappear</span>.
* The reading is different from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [消す](https://jisho.org/search/消す)</span>, unfortunately, so you can't use that. Just think about how after the object in front of you disappears you use a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>) to open an invisible door. That's where everything's disappearing to! You see all your disappeared stuff on the other side of this invisible door which you opened with a magical <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span>.
* 消
* Extinguish
* [sound:消える_b.mp3]
