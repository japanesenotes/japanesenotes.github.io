## Mnemonics:
ひらがななんて、しんけんにべんきょうすれば二日あれば十ぶんさ。
* If you study diligently, two days is enough to learn hiragana.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Second day</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> day two</span>. No matter how you look at this combination of kanji, the meaning of the word makes a lot of sense!
* Words that count days use an exceptional reading. Even though this is a jukugo word, it uses kun'yomi readings for both the kanji. Think about this word this way:<br />The circus is in town this weekend and you can't wait to get there. You want to show off your new <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foots car</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふつか](https://jisho.org/search/ふつか)</span>) to all the circus clowns. But you have to use your feet to get it there and it ends up taking you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two days</span>! Darn this old fashioned foots car!
* 二, 日
* Two, Sun
* [sound:二日_b.mp3]
* [sound:二日_g.mp3]
