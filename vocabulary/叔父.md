## Mnemonics:

* 
* An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> uncle</span> on your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> father</span>'s side is still your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> uncle</span>. This uncle always has to be younger than him though. 
* The reading for this word is an exception. But you already learned the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [伯父](https://jisho.org/search/伯父)</span> which means uncle too. Well they have the same reading! So if you know one uncle, you know them all!
