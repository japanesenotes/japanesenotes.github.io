## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> squeeze</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to squeeze</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to wring</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.  You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />A diehard fan comes up and says she would like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to squeeze</span> your hands. You let her and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> she bow</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しぼ](https://jisho.org/search/しぼ)</span>) over and over as she squeezes your hand really hard. You don't know why she bows so much, but you don't know how to tell her to stop.
