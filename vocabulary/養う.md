たまにはご主人にも感謝しろよ。あいつだって、立派に家族を養ってきたじゃないか。
* You should thank your husband sometimes. He has done a good job raising your family, hasn’t he?
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foster</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to foster</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.

After the paperwork is over, you can finally say: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Yah, she now</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [やしな](https://jisho.org/search/やしな)</span>) is my kid!
