## Mnemonics:

* 
* Alright, so it's not quite the same, but something that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fresh</span> is also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> vivid</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> splendid</span>. I know those are a couple things I'd associate with freshness. Try to make the connection here before moving on.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> vivid</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> splendid</span> fresh fish is MINE! You grab the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> other</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あざ](https://jisho.org/search/あざ)</span>) one that's not as vivid and splendid. This one is mine.
