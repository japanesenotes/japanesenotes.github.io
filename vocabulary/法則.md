## Mnemonics:

* 
* It's both a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> law</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rule</span>. This usually refers to something that is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> physical law</span>, but also can simply be a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> law</span>, too. Anyways, lots of rules. Lots of laws. It's both, so the stronger one (law) takes precedence.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 法, 則
* Method, Rule
