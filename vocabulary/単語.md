日本語の単語ゲーム作ったんだけど、やってみない？
* I created a Japanese word game. Do you want to try?
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> simple</span> bits of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> language</span> are the individual <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> word</span>s. If you think about it, this is true. First of all, there are a ton of them. Second, they're tiny. They're just little bits of language and the word for these little bits is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> word</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 単, 語
