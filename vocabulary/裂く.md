## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> split</span>, but if you split something, you are going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to tear</span> it or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to rip up</span> it.
* In order to get it open, you need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to tear</span> and rip up a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sack</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さく](https://jisho.org/search/さく)</span>). Sacks don't have tabs or zippers or any of those fancy things. If you want to get at the stuff in a sack you have to tear the top right off!
