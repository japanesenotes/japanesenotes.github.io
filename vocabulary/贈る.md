## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> presents</span> so if you do presents, you're giving them, making this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to give a present</span>.
* If you want to give someone a present, maybe you would think about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> send</span>ing/<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [送る](https://jisho.org/search/送る)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おくる](https://jisho.org/search/おくる)</span>) it to them?
