## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lonely</span>? It's still <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lonely</span>!
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />No one is as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lonely</span> as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sa</span>d <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bee</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さび](https://jisho.org/search/さび)</span>). The sad bee is sad because it has no friends and that makes is super lonely. Poor sad bee.
