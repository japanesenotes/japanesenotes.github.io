ビエットが100%正しいよ。今すぐコウイチ起こすべきだよ。
* You are absolutely correct, Viet! We should definitely wake Koichi up right now!
* You've seen <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [起きる](https://jisho.org/search/起きる)</span> which is to wake up. This is similar, except you are doing the waking up, which makes the meaning of this word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to wake someone up</span>. How do you differentiate between this and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [起きる](https://jisho.org/search/起きる)</span>? Because of the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span> on the end. You wake someone up violently, wrenching their neck. They turn around and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span>) you, making you wish you never woke them up.
* The reading is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [起きる](https://jisho.org/search/起きる)</span>, so as long as you know that word you should be able to read this one. Of course, you can also imagine them yelling OH! when you shake them awake too, if that helps.
* 起
* Wake Up
