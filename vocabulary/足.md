## Mnemonics:
もし私が足を切り落としても、すぐにまた生えてくるんだよね？
* If I cut off my foot it will grow back soon, right?
* The kanji and the word are almost exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foot</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foot</span>, you know?
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />If you remember in the radical/kanji mnemonic, you kick someone with your foot. But what happens after you kick them? Turns out they were made of fire, and you just burned your foot off, turning it to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ash</span>es (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あし](https://jisho.org/search/あし)</span>). Imagine this happening.
* 足
* Foot
* [sound:足_b.mp3]
* [sound:足_g.mp3]
