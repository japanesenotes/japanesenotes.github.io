## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to attack</span>, though it usually means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to shoot</span>, because that's a very common way in which to attack someone. Pow!
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Who are you going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to shoot</span>? You are going to shoot <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> You</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span>). Why? Because there's another version of you in front of you, so if you don't shoot that version of you who is you, amirite?
