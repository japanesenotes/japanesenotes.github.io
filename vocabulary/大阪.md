## Mnemonics:
あいにくですが、来週の水曜日はちょっと都合がつかないんです。代わりに来週の木曜日に大阪に行くってのはどうでしょうか？
* I’m afraid I won’t be able to make it next Wednesday. What about going to Osaka next Thursday instead?
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> big</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> heights</span>. What a nice area to be, it's where everyone wants to live! This magical place is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Osaka</span>. Heard of it before? It's a city, and kind of the rival to Tokyo.
* The reading is pretty weird, but then again so are people from Osaka (just kidding, Osakazens!). The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [大](https://jisho.org/search/大)</span> reads like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おお](https://jisho.org/search/おお)</span> from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おお](https://jisho.org/search/おお)きい</span>. Then, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [阪](https://jisho.org/search/阪)</span> uses the kun'yomi reading as well, which you didn't learn. That being said, doesn't this kanji look like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [坂](https://jisho.org/search/坂)</span>, which also means slope? Well, it shares a kun'yomi reading as well, so if you've seen <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [坂](https://jisho.org/search/坂)</span> you can apply that reading over to here, making <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おお](https://jisho.org/search/おお)さか</span>. Then again, if you know this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Osaka</span> you probably can figure out how to write it too. Don't forget the double <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おお](https://jisho.org/search/おお)</span> though!
* 大, 阪
* Big, Heights
* [sound:大阪_b.mp3]
* [sound:大阪_g.mp3]
