## Mnemonics:
暴走したトラックが、トーフグオフィスに突っ込んで来る夢を見た。
* I had a dream that a runaway truck crashed into the Tofugu office.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Violent</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> running</span>... sounds like a marathon gone wrong. No, this is when you run around and you're all violent. A better way to describe this would be to say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> run wild</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> run out of control</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 暴, 走
* Violence, Run
* [sound:暴走_b.mp3]
