## Mnemonics:
こおりの上で、止まることができなかった。
* I couldn’t stop on the ice.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb.<br />This is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. Something comes to a stop. No direct object here. That's why this verb means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to stop</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You come to a stop sign and decide <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to stop</span> because the sign has a picture of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> toe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [と](https://jisho.org/search/と)</span>) on it. This toe looks eerily like a toe your Ma (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ま](https://jisho.org/search/ま)</span>) has too... and your Ma always taught you to stop and look both ways before crossing her toes.
* 止
* Stop
* [sound:止まる_b.mp3]
* [sound:止まる_g.mp3]
