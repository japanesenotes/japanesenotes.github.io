六月のてんきは、くもりときどきミートボールです。
* The weather for June is cloudy with a chance of meatballs.
* Since the kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [月](https://jisho.org/search/月)</span> means both moon and month, what is the sixth month of the year? January, February, March, April, May, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> June</span>!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Also, this is a specific month, so it uses the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がつ](https://jisho.org/search/がつ)</span> reading.
* 六, 月
* Six, Moon
* [sound:六月_b.mp3]
* [sound:六月_g.mp3]
