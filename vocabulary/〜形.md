## Mnemonics:
どうして今、過去形で言ったの？
* Why did you just say that in past tense?
* The kanji and the word share one of the same meanings: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> form</span>. It doesn't just mean form though, it means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tense</span> too. Like verb tense.
* This has the same reading as the kanji you learned, meaning you know the reading!
* 形
* Shape
* [sound:〜形_b.mp3]
* [sound:〜形_g.mp3]
