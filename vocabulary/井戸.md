## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> well</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> door</span> is just a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> well</span>. It's the door that goes into the well hole, making it a well.
* This kanji uses the kun'yomi readings for each kanji, for some reason. You learned the kun'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [戸](https://jisho.org/search/戸)</span>, but in this case it's rendaku'd so it becomes <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ど](https://jisho.org/search/ど)</span> instead of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [と](https://jisho.org/search/と)</span>. You didn't learn the kun'yomi version of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [井](https://jisho.org/search/井)</span> with the kanji. Think of this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> well</span>, and look inside. There you see an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>), stuck inside. As you pull it out, it scratches your eyes out.
* 井, 戸
* Well, Door
* [sound:井戸_b.mp3]
