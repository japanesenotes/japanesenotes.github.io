## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> leak</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to leak</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Causing you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to leak</span> all over the floor (we're talking blood, here) is your friend <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Moe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [も](https://jisho.org/search/も)</span>). If you know someone named Moe, imagine them doing this. If you don't, think of a famous Moe.
