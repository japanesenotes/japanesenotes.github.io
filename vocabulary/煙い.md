## Mnemonics:
煙いなあ！一体いつになったら煙草やめるんだよ？本当に臭いんだけど。
* It’s so smoky! When the heck are you going to quit smoking? This really smells awful.
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> smoke</span>? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> smoky</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: All this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> smoki</span>ness is from a terrible <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chem</span>ical (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けむ](https://jisho.org/search/けむ)</span>) spill that happened nearby. It was acid, so it burned everything up real good, causing the air to get pretty smokey.
