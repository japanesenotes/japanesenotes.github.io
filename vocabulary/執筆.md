## Mnemonics:

* 
* If you have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tenacious</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> writing brush</span>, you are doing a lot of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> writing</span>. Also, if you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> write for a magazine</span> you probably write a ton too, because they have to come out with new issues every week or month.
* The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [執](https://jisho.org/search/執)</span> is a little altered, where <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しつ](https://jisho.org/search/しつ)</span> is shortened to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しっ](https://jisho.org/search/しっ)</span>. You've seen this kind of thing before, so just keep this shortening pattern in mind and you'll be a-okay!
