* Your hair is still wet. You should dry it before you go to sleep.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wet</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to get wet</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading with the kanji, so you should be able to read it already!
