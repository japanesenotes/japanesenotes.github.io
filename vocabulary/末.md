## Mnemonics:
激しい口論の末、末息子は私の金をどこかに埋めるために出て行ってしまいました。
* After a heated discussion, my youngest son left to bury my gold somewhere.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Throw a the in there if you'd like, as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />You've reached <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> the end</span> of the universe. Nothing is there. You step out, and you're surprised because you get greeted by <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Sue</span>. Imagine meeting this Sue, and talking to them for a while. You should come up with a Sue that you know or a famous Sue that you know. Just pick something you can remember.
* 末
* End
