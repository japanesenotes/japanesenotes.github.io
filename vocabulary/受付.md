## Mnemonics:
え？知らない。受付で聞いてない？
* Huh? I don’t know. Didn't someone at reception explain it to you?
* Imagine someone <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accept</span>ing something and then <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attach</span>ing something. This person is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> receptionist</span>, because they are accepting the call, writing down the information, and then attaching said information to a sticky note for you to read. You say, No, I'm not available.
* For this reading you have to think back to the verb words that get used with this kanji, namely <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [受ける]([受](https://jisho.org/search/受)ける)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [付ける]([付](https://jisho.org/search/付)ける)</span>. Then just drop off the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span>s and put them together. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [受](https://jisho.org/search/受)</span> becomes <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うけ](https://jisho.org/search/うけ)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [付](https://jisho.org/search/付)</span> becomes <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つけ](https://jisho.org/search/つけ)</span> and you're left with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うけ](https://jisho.org/search/うけ)つけ</span>. This is what's called a compound word. And now you know it. Nice!
* 受, 付
* Accept, Attach
