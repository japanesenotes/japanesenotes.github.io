* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Set up</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> become</span> something. When you set up and care for something like this you're doing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> organization</span> of this thing. The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> configuration</span> is so nice.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
