## Mnemonics:
このパーティーマジでつまんない。道でティシュでも配ってる方がマシだよ。
* This party blows. Even passing out pocket tissues on the street would be better.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> distribute</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to distribute</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to distribute</span> some fliers to everyone. On the fliers it talks about a striptease show where <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kubla</span>i (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くば](https://jisho.org/search/くば)</span>) Khan does something naughty. Imagine this show, and imagine your shame of being the person handing out these fliers. How far the Khan has fallen.
