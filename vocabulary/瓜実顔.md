## Mnemonics:

* 
* If you ask me to tell the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> truth</span> I'll say your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> face</span> is shaped like a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> melon</span>. No no, it's not a bad thing! You just have a really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> oval face</span>!
* This word consists of the kun'yomi readings for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [瓜](https://jisho.org/search/瓜)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [顔](https://jisho.org/search/顔)</span>, but in the middle there, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [実](https://jisho.org/search/実)</span> has a bit of an exceptional reading. You certainly haven't learned this weirdness before, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You know who has an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> oval face</span>? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Zane</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ざね](https://jisho.org/search/ざね)</span>) formerly from One Direction. When you think of handsome oval faces, picture Zane's.
