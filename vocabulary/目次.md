## Mnemonics:
この本全部読まないとだめ？目次だけ読むってことは無理かな？
* Do I have to read this whole book? Can’t I just read the table of contents?
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eye</span> is on what's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> next</span>. How is this possible to see what's coming up? That's because you're looking at a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> table of contents</span>.
* The readings are the on'yomi readings, but you learned the kun'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [目](https://jisho.org/search/目)</span> before. So, you have to remember that this word uses <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もく](https://jisho.org/search/もく)</span> instead of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [め](https://jisho.org/search/め)</span>. To do that, imagine yourself looking at a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> table of contents</span>. Instead of being a normal table of contents there, it's just line after line of text trying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もく](https://jisho.org/search/もく)</span>) you. Come up with what those lines are and think about how you're being mocked.
* 目, 次
* Eye, Next
