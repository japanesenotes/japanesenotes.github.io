## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stab</span> so the verb vocab version must also be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to stab</span>.
* If you're going to get stabbed, don't get stabbed <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>) times. You can remember that this is the two time stab stab because it has a hole that's big. The hole is big because you got stabbed twice.
* 突
* Stab
* [sound:突く_b.mp3]
* [sound:突く_g.mp3]
