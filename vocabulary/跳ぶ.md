## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hop</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to hop</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to jump</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to leap</span>. Basically anything that gets both feet off the ground via your own foot propulsion.
* Know how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [飛ぶ](https://jisho.org/search/飛ぶ)</span> means to fly? This is a similar idea, though this time you're not flying nearly as much, because you're just hopping or jumping. Anyways, the readings are the same.
* 跳
* Hop
