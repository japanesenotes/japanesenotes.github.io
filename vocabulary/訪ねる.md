## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> visit</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to visit</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to visit</span> your friend <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Taz</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たず](https://jisho.org/search/たず)</span>) the Tasmanian Devil. He's your best bro, so imagine visiting him and having a good time and saying you're going to visit him again.
