You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />What's the first two letters of the word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mourning</span>? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [も](https://jisho.org/search/も)</span>). You can use that to remember.
