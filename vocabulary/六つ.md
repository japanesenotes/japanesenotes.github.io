## Mnemonics:
わたしは、六つのカップをかいました。
* I bought six packs of cups.
* Any number with a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span> attached to it means you are counting that number of things. In this case, it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> six things</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can guess that it uses the kun'yomi reading. Here's a mnemonic to help you do that:<br />What are the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> six things</span> that you need to count? This time you are counting six cows (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> むっつ</span>). The reason it's six, you know, is because you wanted a half a dozen cows. No more, no less.
* 六
* Six
* [sound:六つ_b.mp3]
