## Mnemonics:
先ずは、チキンの羽をむしりとって、それぞれの羽に名前をつけます。
* First you need to pluck the chicken and then name each of the feathers.
* The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> previous</span>. This is an adverb version of that word. It's a little thing you can begin sentences with. You can't start your sentences with previous but you can start it with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> First of all</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to start with</span>.<br />This is usually written without kanji though, so keep that in mind.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. In fact, the reading for this word is very rare, and kind of an exception. We'll use a mnemonic that uses both the kanji part and the hiragana attachment part. <br /><span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> First of all</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to start with</span>, you have to make it through this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> maze</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まず](https://jisho.org/search/まず)</span>).
* 先
* Previous
