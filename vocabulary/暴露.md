## Mnemonics:

* 
* Using <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> violence</span> I'm going to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> expose</span> the truth! This is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> disclosure</span>. This is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exposure</span>.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [暴](https://jisho.org/search/暴)</span> is strange and new, not what you learned with the kanji. Just think about how when there is disclosure or exposure of something, you are surprised. You can't believe that's the truth. You have to take a step <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> back</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばく](https://jisho.org/search/ばく)</span>) to deal with the new information.
* 暴, 露
* Violence, Expose
