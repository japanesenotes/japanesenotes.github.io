夕べ、ひたいに肉とかいてみた。
* Last night I wrote the kanji for meat on my forehead.
* This vocab word has a weird little extra bit on it (the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [べ](https://jisho.org/search/べ)</span>). You can sort of ignore that, it doesn't really mean anything in particular. The meaning of this vocab word and the kanji it comes from are the same: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> evening</span>
* When hiragana is attached to a kanji, you can usually assume that that kanji is going to be read using the kun'yomi reading, which is exactly what's going on with this word as well. By learning this word's kanji you've also learned the reading for this word.
