## Mnemonics:

* 
* Please <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> temporarily</span> wait. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> In a little while</span> something will happen, but temporarily you'll have to sit still.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> In a little while</span>, we're going to be listening to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shiba rock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しばらく](https://jisho.org/search/しばらく)</span>). This is a form of rock and roll performed by shiba dogs. You should look up shiba inu puppy pictures if you haven't ever heard of shiba inus.
* 暫
