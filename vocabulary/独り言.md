* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [独り](https://jisho.org/search/独り)</span> is when you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alone</span>. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [言](https://jisho.org/search/言)</span> is when you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> say</span> something. So, when you say something and you're alone, you're just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> talking to yourself</span>.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [独り](https://jisho.org/search/独り)</span> is just the reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [独り](https://jisho.org/search/独り)</span>. The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [言](https://jisho.org/search/言)</span> is an exception, though. It's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ごと](https://jisho.org/search/ごと)</span>, which comes from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こと](https://jisho.org/search/こと)</span>. Just think that as you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> talking to yourself</span> you're telling yourself over and over to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> go to</span> hell. You're mean to yourself, and you're also insane, which is why you keep saying that out loud to nobody but you.
* 独, 言
* Alone, Say
