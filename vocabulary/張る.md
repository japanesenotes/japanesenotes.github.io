## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stretch</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to stretch</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Imagine yourself trying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to stretch</span> (or better yet stand up and do it). Every time you stretch you start to laugh uncontrollably. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> HA</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span>) HA HA HA HA HA. Go ahead and laugh like that out loud while you stretch, it will help you to remember this reading.
