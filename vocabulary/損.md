* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> loss</span> will give you a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> disadvantage</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> handicap</span>. So, try not to get any losses... or you'll be at a disadvantage.
* The reading comes from the kanji, so you aren't at a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> disadvantage</span>... this time.
