## Mnemonics:
マットのしゅみは、土をほりあげることだ。
* Matt’s hobby is digging dirt.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. Here's a mnemonic to help you to remember it: <br />You look through the soil. You're trying to find something. As you dig and sift, you come across not one but <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two chee</span>ses (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つち](https://jisho.org/search/つち)</span>). Pull them out of the ground and put them in your mouth. How do the two cheeses taste and compare?
* 土
* Dirt
* [sound:土_b.mp3]
