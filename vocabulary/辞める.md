* Since Fugu quit, I’m thinking about getting him a swim ring as a farewell gift. If anyone wants to join in on my idea, let me know.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> quit</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to quit</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.
