## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rapid</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sick</span>ness is an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> illness</span> or a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> disease</span>.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [病](https://jisho.org/search/病)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />If you don't treat an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> illness</span> right away you'll end up <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pay</span>ing (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぺい](https://jisho.org/search/ぺい)</span>) with your life. And if you don't die, you'll still have to pay a lot for doctor and hospital fees. Yuck.
