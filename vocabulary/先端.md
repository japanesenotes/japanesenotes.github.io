* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Previous</span> to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> edge</span> is what's right before the edge is over. That's the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tip</span> of the edge. It's also a word used to describe <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> the latest</span> (technology, etc), because it's on the bleeding edge, so to speak. The tip!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
