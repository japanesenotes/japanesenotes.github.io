## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> misguided</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be misguided</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: If you are going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be misguided</span> you're going to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mad</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まど](https://jisho.org/search/まど)</span>) about it, most likely. Nobody likes to be misguided, so imagine how mad you feel when you are.
