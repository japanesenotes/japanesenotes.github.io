## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dirty</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to get dirty</span>. You know you're not doing the dirtying, because it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rare</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れる](https://jisho.org/search/れる)</span>) for you to get anything dirty, though things do get dirty on their own.
* Things seem <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to get dirty</span> easily around here, which is why <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> you go</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よご](https://jisho.org/search/よご)</span>) to great lengths to keep things clean.
