## Mnemonics:
２４度ぐらいがちょうどいいと思うんだけど。
* I think about 24 degrees is just right for me.
* The kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> degree</span> can mean both degree in terms of angles and degree in terms of temperature. This word is how you talk about these things. Just attach it to a number and you have yourself the number of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> degrees</span> that something is.
* The reading is the same as the kanji reading you learned. When writing out the answer to this reading, omit the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [〜](https://jisho.org/search/〜)</span> as it's only there to let you know that some other word should come before it.
* 度
* Degrees
* [sound:〜度_b.mp3]
* [sound:〜度_g.mp3]
