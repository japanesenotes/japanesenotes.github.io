## Mnemonics:

* 
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> undress</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> run</span> out of that room. You had to take off your clothes in order <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to escape</span>, but now you can run and start <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to flee</span>. Just imagine some sort of contraption that holds you in place via your clothes, and you need to escape from it by taking said clothes off. Now imagine running away from that place naked. Escape!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だつ](https://jisho.org/search/だつ)</span> changes to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だっ](https://jisho.org/search/だっ)</span>, though, so be careful of that.
* 脱, 走
* Undress, Run
