## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is the noun version of the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> resent</span>, so it means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> resentment</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You feel some pretty strong <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> resentment</span> toward your roommate because you had to touch their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> icky doo</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いきどお](https://jisho.org/search/いきどお)</span>) today and it was covered in what you hope was glue. Or frosting. UHG what an icky door. This is an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> outrage</span>!!!
