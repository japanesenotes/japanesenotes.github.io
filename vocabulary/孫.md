## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You are the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grandchild</span> of your grandfather. His favorite thing is to call you a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> maggo</span>t (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まご](https://jisho.org/search/まご)</span>). Your grandfather was in the military and is very hard on you, maggot.
