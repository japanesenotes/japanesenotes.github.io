## Mnemonics:
月の六日目に、くまがバーにやってきた。
* A bear came into the bar on the sixth day of the month.
* It's the kanji for six and day. Put them together and you have the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sixth day</span> (or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> day six</span>).
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. This is an exception, though. When you're counting days (at least one through ten), the kun'yomi readings are used. So let's think about that sixth day - what does it entail?<br />The cow (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> moo</span> / <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [むい](https://jisho.org/search/むい)</span>) is standing on top of your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> car</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>). Why? Because you only feed the cow once a week, and that is on the seventh day. He's standing there on the sixth day because he's super hungry and knows it's almost time.
* 六, 日
* Six, Sun
* [sound:六日_b.mp3]
* [sound:六日_g.mp3]
