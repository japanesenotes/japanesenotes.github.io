## Mnemonics:

* 
* When you use your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> intuition</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> determine</span> the amount of something, you'll end up doing the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> calculations</span> in your head. You do the same thing when it's time to pay your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bill</span> at dinner too, just determine the amount in your head, go with your intuition, and it should be the right amount.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [定](https://jisho.org/search/定)</span> though, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />If you're having trouble with the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> calculation</span> of the amount on your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bill</span>, just call <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Jo</span>seph (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょう](https://jisho.org/search/じょう)</span>) Stalin. He's really great at numbers and he will be able to figure out the numbers in his head really fast.
* 勘, 定
* Intuition, Determine
