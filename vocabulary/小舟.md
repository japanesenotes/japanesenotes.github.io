## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> small</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boat</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boat</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> small craft</span>. If something is a big boat it's better to call it a ship I think, which is why this is just a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boat</span>.
* The readings are all ones you've seen before. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [小](https://jisho.org/search/小)</span> uses its <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span> reading, so just think of this like a child boat. This makes sense because it's small. Watch out for the rendaku. 
* 小, 舟
* Small, Boat
