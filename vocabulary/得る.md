## Mnemonics:
日本で英語を教えるという経験から、たくさんのことが得られました。
* I got a lot out of my experience teaching English in Japan.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> acquire</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to acquire</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to acquire</span> an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> e</span>lephant (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [え](https://jisho.org/search/え)</span>) for your elephant collection. If you don't acquire an elephant, you'll look like an idiot in front of your elephant collecting friends.
* 得
* Acquire
* [sound:得る_b.mp3]
