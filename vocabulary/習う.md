## Mnemonics:
今日は、世界一のフグクッキーの作り方を習いに行くのよ。それ、子供たち大好きよね。
* I’m going to learn how to make the world’s best fugu cookies today. Kids will love that, right?
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> learn</span> so the vocab verb version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to learn</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to learn</span> about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Nara</span>, the city of deer... lots and lots of deer. If you don't know about it, how about learning about it?
