## Mnemonics:
オバマ大統領が作った料理に、塩をひとつまみ加えた。
* I added a pinch of salt to the dish President Obama made.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> add</span> so the verb vocab version would be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to add</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You hold a Christmas party every year. This year, instead of just Christmas you have to add other winter holidays to the mix so people don't get upset. First up? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kwa</span>nzaa (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くわ](https://jisho.org/search/くわ)</span>).
* 加
* Add
* [sound:加える_b.mp3]
* [sound:加える_g.mp3]
