## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [蒸れる](https://jisho.org/search/蒸れる)</span> is to be humid. So, if you have a humid hot, you have weather that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hot and humid</span> (or you can just say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> humid</span>, because that implies hotness too, usually). This is a useful word for summers in Japan, since you'll complain about this all the time.
* The reading comes from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [蒸れる](https://jisho.org/search/蒸れる)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [暑い](https://jisho.org/search/暑い)</span>. Know those and you know this too.
* 蒸, 暑
* Steam, Hot
