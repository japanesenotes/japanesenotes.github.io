## Mnemonics:
ふじ山はしろいとりのふんでおおわれていた。
* Mt. Fuji was covered in white bird poop.
* Just look at this word. What do you think it means? That's right - it's a name (Fuji) plus the kanji for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mountain</span>. Put those together, and you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Mount Fuji</span>. In English the Mount(ain) part comes first. In Japanese, it comes at the end, sort of like the name ender <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さん](https://jisho.org/search/さん)</span>, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちゃん](https://jisho.org/search/ちゃん)</span>, and so on. You can add <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [山](https://jisho.org/search/山)</span> to the end of any mountain's name too, not just Mount Fuji.
* Normally <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふじ](https://jisho.org/search/ふじ)</span> would be in kanji, but I wanted you to see this kanji use in action since it's more useful than just being used on Mount Fuji. This is treated like a jukugo word (combo kanji word). In the case of jukugo, usually the on'yomi reading is used, meaning you just have to remember the on'yomi reading of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [山](https://jisho.org/search/山)</span>. Luckily, you learned this when you were learning the kanji, so you should already know it!
