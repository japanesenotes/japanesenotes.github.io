## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grip</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to grasp</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You go <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to grasp</span> someone. You really need them. You are soooo <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> needy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にぎ](https://jisho.org/search/にぎ)</span>). Except, you can't really pronounce d sounds very well, so you say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> にぎ</span>.
