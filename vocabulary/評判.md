## Mnemonics:

* 
* When people <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> evaluate</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> judge</span> you at every turn, it means you have much <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fame</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reputation</span>. Wouldn't this be terrible if people evaluated and judged you 24/7? Having that kind of fame would be difficult.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はん](https://jisho.org/search/はん)</span> changes to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばん](https://jisho.org/search/ばん)</span>, too, so be careful of that.
* 評, 判
* Evaluate, Judge
