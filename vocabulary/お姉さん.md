## Mnemonics:
私のお姉さんは、バイクを買うことが彼氏を見つけることに繋がると考えています。
* My older sister thinks that buying a motorcycle will help her get a boyfriend.
* The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)</span> makes the word more polite. You're elevating the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> older sister</span> title because you're a good younger sibling. Otherwise, the meaning of this word is the same as the kanji - just the feeling is different.
* The reading is different too. It has some hiragana attached to it, which is a clue that this uses a kun'yomi reading. Let's use a mnemonic to learn that reading. <br />Imagine your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> older sister</span> (even if you don't have one). She is, for some reason, a horse. Imagine petting her, giving her carrots, and doing other horse-related things with her. What do horses say? They say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nehhhh</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ねえ](https://jisho.org/search/ねえ)</span>).
* 姉
