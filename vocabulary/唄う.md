## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shamisen song</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to sing</span>.
* Remember how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [歌う](https://jisho.org/search/歌う)</span> means to sing too? Well it has the same reading. If you know that one, you know this one. Yay!
