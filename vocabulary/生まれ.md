## Mnemonics:
生まれは大阪ですが、育ちは奈良です。
* My birthplace is Osaka, but I was raised in Nara.
* Remember how you learned that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [生まれる](https://jisho.org/search/生まれる)</span> means to be born? Well once you're born that place where it happened becomes your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> birthplace</span>!
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading when you learned <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [生まれる](https://jisho.org/search/生まれる)</span>. Just drop the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span> off the end and you have your reading!
* 生
* Life
* [sound:生まれ_b.mp3]
* [sound:生まれ_g.mp3]
