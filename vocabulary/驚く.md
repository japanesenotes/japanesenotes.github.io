## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> surprised</span>, so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be surprised</span>.
* What are you so surprised by? Your friend's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> odor</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おどろ](https://jisho.org/search/おどろ)</span>). Think of a friend that you wouldn't expect to be so smelly. Then, be surprised by the odor. Eww, bro, you have to take a shower.
