## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sky</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> can</span> is a can that has nothing but sky in it. It's an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> empty can</span>.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [空き](https://jisho.org/search/空き)</span> isn't one you've seen before. Remember how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [開く](https://jisho.org/search/開く)</span> means to open? Well, this can is also open, because nothing is filling it. The readings are the same between the two, as well. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [開く](https://jisho.org/search/開く)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [空く](https://jisho.org/search/空く)</span>, though in this case it becomes the stem form: <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [空き](https://jisho.org/search/空き)</span>.
