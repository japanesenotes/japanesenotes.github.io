## Mnemonics:
君の新しい子犬が気に入ってもらえるといいんだけど。
* I hope you’re happy with your new puppy.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> enter</span> into the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> energy</span>. When you're entering (positive) energy into something, you are going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be pleased with</span> it. Just imagine yourself adding some physical, happy energy into something you're pleased with. Smile and feel pleased as well!
* The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [気](https://jisho.org/search/気)</span> portion is pretty straight forward. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [入る](https://jisho.org/search/入る)</span> portion looks like it's supposed to be <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はいる](https://jisho.org/search/はいる)</span> but it's not. Do you remember <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [入れる／いれる](https://jisho.org/search/入れる／いれる)</span>? This one is kind of a mix of both of them. It's just <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いる](https://jisho.org/search/いる)</span>. Just imagine you're so pleased with something that you just put everything together and end up with a combination of both of them (they both are so pleasing!). So it's not <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はいる](https://jisho.org/search/はいる)</span> and it's not <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いれる](https://jisho.org/search/いれる)</span> it's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いる](https://jisho.org/search/いる)</span>.
* 気, 入
* Energy, Enter
* [sound:気に入る_b.mp3]
* [sound:気に入る_g.mp3]
