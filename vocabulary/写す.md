* You must pay 1,000 yen in order to transcribe a sutra by hand.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> copy</span> so you know this means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to copy</span>. You know this word means to copy because it ends with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span>. You're copying the documents you need to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span>) someone who screwed you over.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)つ</span> part. To remember that, think of yourself as a beatboxer. You're saying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> うつうつうつ</span> over and over again. Thing is, the other beatboxer is going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to copy</span> everything you do. That's why you're suing him.
