## Mnemonics:
事をはっきりさせるまでに、いったい何回この会話を繰り返さないといけねえんだよ？だから俺はリューク・スカイウォーカーじゃねえんだよ。映画でその役を演じただけだっつーの。俺の名前はマークだ。シカゴに住んでる。
* How many times do we have to have this conversation until it finally sinks in? I am not Luke Skywalker. I played him in a movie. My name is Mark. I live in Chicago.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> What</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> times</span>? This doesn't make any sense. One thing you'll notice with Japanese and kanji is that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [何](https://jisho.org/search/何)</span>, when added to other things, often means how many _____ rather than what ____. Just something you have to know and experience a bit to catch on to, but you will, I believe in you. So, for this one it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> how many times</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 何, 回
* What, Times
* [sound:何回_b.mp3]
* [sound:何回_g.mp3]
