## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: How many things are in this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cluster</span>? asks your boss. Just a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> few sah</span>, (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふさ](https://jisho.org/search/ふさ)</span>) you reply.
* 房
* Cluster
* [sound:房_b.mp3]
