## Mnemonics:
毎日何度も何度も同じことの繰り返しで、虚しくなりませんか。
* Don't you feel empty doing the same thing every day over and over again?
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> void</span>? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> empty</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> vacant</span>. Just think of what has to happen to make a void in the first place.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />If everything in life seems <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> empty</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> futile</span>, even cows will be affected. Listen to them say, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Moo, nah</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [むな](https://jisho.org/search/むな)</span>), never mind. What's the point? Nothing makes life seem empty like a cow saying Moo, nah.
