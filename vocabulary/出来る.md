## Mnemonics:
私は内面を美しくするために化粧品を食べました。あなたにもそれが出来ますか？
* I ate my make-up to be pretty on the inside. Can you do that, too?
* When you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exit</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> come</span>, apparently it means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be able to do</span>. I think of it like you're leaving a location (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [出](https://jisho.org/search/出)</span>) to do a task and then you come (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [来る](https://jisho.org/search/来る)</span>) back after you did it. Perhaps you were waiting in a room training like someone from Dragonball. When you leave the room, you are ready to fight the enemy and win. You train in that room <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be able to do</span> whatever you need to do, and only leave and come back alive because you were able to do it.
* The readings are a bit strange. Both kun'yomi, where <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [出](https://jisho.org/search/出)</span> is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [で](https://jisho.org/search/で)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [来る](https://jisho.org/search/来る)</span> is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きる](https://jisho.org/search/きる)</span>. This is different from the reading you learned with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [来る](https://jisho.org/search/来る)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くる](https://jisho.org/search/くる)</span>), though, so be careful. If you can remember that and remember the kun'yomi readings from the previous vocab, you should be able to learn this one's reading as well.
* 出, 来
* Exit, Come
