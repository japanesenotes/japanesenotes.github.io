## Mnemonics:

* 
* Take the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> middle</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> route</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> half</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> edge</span>. You don't do anything the full way. Just to the middle. Just to the half. Not to the edge. This was really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> half finished</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> half assed</span> of you.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぱ](https://jisho.org/search/ぱ)</span> at the end is the only tricky part here since that isn't a common reading (or the one you learned before) for the kanji. Just watch out for that, and you'll be fine.
