## Mnemonics:
きょねんの二月に、わたしたちのふりんははじまったの。
* Our affair began in February of last year.
* The kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [月](https://jisho.org/search/月)</span> means both month and moon (because moon cycles take about a month, presumably). So, what is the number two month? It's not January... it's not March... it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> February</span>!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. That is true with this word as well. Make sure to take note that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [月](https://jisho.org/search/月)</span> is using the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がつ](https://jisho.org/search/がつ)</span> reading and not the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [げつ](https://jisho.org/search/げつ)</span> one. This is true for all month words in Japanese.
* 二, 月
* Two, Moon
* [sound:二月_b.mp3]
* [sound:二月_g.mp3]
