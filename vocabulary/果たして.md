## Mnemonics:
あのカフェでコウイチに会えるかもしれないと思っていたら、果たしてその通りになった。
* I thought I might be able to meet Koichi at the cafe, and sure enough, I did.
* So this doesn't really make much sense in terms of the kanji and word, but it is what it is. Let's remember it this way:<br />The kanji is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fruit</span> so the meaning is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> really</span>? Like, really really? Because it sounds like you made that up. I really doubt it means really.<br />It can also mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> as was expected</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> just as I thought</span>, but usually we use it as a way to say, Really? I don't really believe you...
* To remember the reading, just imagine yourself snorting out a sharp <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> HA</span>! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span>) right before saying the phrase: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> HA!</span> Just as I thought.
* 果
* Fruit
* [sound:果たして_b.mp3]
* [sound:果たして_g.mp3]
