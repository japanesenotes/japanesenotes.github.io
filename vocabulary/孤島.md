## Mnemonics:

* 
* An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> orphan</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> island</span> is one that's all alone, without any other island friends or family. That's what makes it a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> solitary island</span>.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [島](https://jisho.org/search/島)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />There are a few <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> solitary island</span>s off the coast of Japan that are actually considered to be a part of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> To</span>kyo (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とう](https://jisho.org/search/とう)</span>). Usually people think Tokyo is just the big city on the mainland, but it includes these little, lonely islands too!
