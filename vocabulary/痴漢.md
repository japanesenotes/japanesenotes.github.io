* Okay... so before I get into this, you can't get mad at me. I didn't make this word up. I didn't make the Japanese language and I have nothing to do with this. And don't blame Japanese people for it either.<br />So apparently a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stupid</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chinese</span> person is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> molester</span>. Our theory is, that in China Chinese just meant person so a molester was just a stupid person. But in Japanese we think of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [漢](https://jisho.org/search/漢)</span> as Chinese, so there you go. Either way, you'll probably never ever forget this one. You're welcome!
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
* 痴, 漢
* Stupid, Chinese
