## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> opposite</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to oppose</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to go against</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Just like when you play <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soccer</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さか](https://jisho.org/search/さか)</span>). You never play right, causing you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to go against</span> all things you're supposed to do and shoot goals into your own goalie's net.
