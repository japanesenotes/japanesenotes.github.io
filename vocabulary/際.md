## Mnemonics:

* 
* Even though the kanji mainly means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb">  occasion</span>, for some reason this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> side</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> edge</span>. I suppose on <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> occasion</span> kanji takes you to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> edge</span> of what ought to make sense when it comes to kanji.
* You're on the very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> edge</span> of the world. You heard that at the edge of the world are the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key wo</span>rds (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きわ](https://jisho.org/search/きわ)</span>) written there in big fiery letters, telling you the meaning of life. Supposedly these are the words of God himself. They say: We apologize for the inconvenience. WHAT? THESE ARE THE <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> KEY WO</span>RDS???
