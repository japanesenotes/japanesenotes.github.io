## Mnemonics:
今度俺がお前を泣かせる時は、嬉し泣きだ。
* The next time I make you cry it will be because you are happy.
* In the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> now</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb">  occurrence</span> you'll learn your kanji, no? This word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> this time</span> (same like now occurrence). Despite being this time it has the feeling of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> next time</span>, though. It's like saying okay, this time we'll get it where this time really means next time, making it a little bit different from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [今回](https://jisho.org/search/今回)</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 今, 度
* Now, Degrees
* [sound:今度_b.mp3]
* [sound:今度_g.mp3]
