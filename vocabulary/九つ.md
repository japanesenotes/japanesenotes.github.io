## Mnemonics:
ドーナツを九つつくった。
* I made nine donuts.
* This word follows the number of things pattern where there's a kanji for a number plus <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span> on the end. Whenever you see this, you know the word means ____ things. Knowing that, as long as you know the kanji (which you do) you can figure out what number of things it is. For this one, it's the kanji for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nine</span> plus <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>. So, this one is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nine things</span>.
* Since all of the number of things words all follow the same pattern (number plus <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>), you really just have to remember the part before the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span> (and then remember that the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span> is in all of these). All of the readings are the kun'yomi reading, which means we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember them (you know the on'yomi reading of the kanji portion).<br />What thing do you have nine of? The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nine things</span> that you have are nine <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coconu</span>ts (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ここの](https://jisho.org/search/ここの)</span>). Imagine yourself juggling nine coconuts in the air. Try counting them while you're doing this, arriving at nine things.
