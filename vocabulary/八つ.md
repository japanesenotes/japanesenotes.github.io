## Mnemonics:
八つのかおと六つのうでがあるもの、なーんだ。
* What has eight faces and six arms?
* This word follows the number of things pattern where there's a kanji for a number plus <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span> on the end. Whenever you see this, you know the word means ____ things. Knowing that, as long as you know the kanji (which you do) you can figure out what number of things it is. For this one, it's the kanji for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eight</span> plus <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>. So, this one is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eight things</span>.
* Since all of the number of things words all follow the same pattern (number plus <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>), you really just have to remember the part before the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span> (and then remember that the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span> is in all of these). All of the readings are the kun'yomi reading, which means we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember them (you know the on'yomi reading of the kanji portion).<br />So what <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eight things</span> do you have? You have eight <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yachts</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [やっつ](https://jisho.org/search/やっつ)</span>). Go ahead and count them. They're beautiful. Also, be sure not to be confused by this particular reading mnemonic. It includes the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>, even though the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span> is outside the reading you need to learn (just makes things easier for you overall). Since you can see the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span> outside, it shouldn't be too difficult for you.
