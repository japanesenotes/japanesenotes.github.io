## Mnemonics:
そう改まるなよ。コウイチ大統領は、とても気さくなんだから。
* Don’t be so formal! President Koichi is very friendly.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> renew</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be renewed</span>. You're not doing the renewing directly, it's just happening (as renewing often does).
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> To be renewed</span> you decide to go to a spa. You get in a bathtub and they pour in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a lotta</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あらた](https://jisho.org/search/あらた)</span>) leeches and eels to help you to be renewed. Feel the fear. There are a lot of them! Alternatively, you can imagine them pouring in a lotta Maru cats, because that's way fuzzier.
* 改
