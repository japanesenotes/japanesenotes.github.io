## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inherit</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to inherit</span>.
* You not only inherit one fortune, but <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two</span>! You're lucky both sides of your family accidentally died at the same time. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> TWO</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>) fortunes! TWO! HAHAHAHA. Also, you can think of it like the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span> of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [次](https://jisho.org/search/次)</span>, because you are the next successor when you inherit something.
