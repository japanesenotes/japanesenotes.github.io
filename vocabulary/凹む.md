## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hollow</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to become hollow</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to sink</span>
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You feel like you've started <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to become hollow</span> when you have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> he</span>ad <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> co</span>ld (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [へこ](https://jisho.org/search/へこ)</span>). You may be all stuffed up, but it's making you so sad that you feel hollow somehow.
