通路側の席をお願いします。窓から外の景色を眺めるのが嫌いなんです。
* Could I have an aisle seat, please? I hate looking out the window.
* This is a tricky word that doesn't really have a good translation. The best ways I've seen it done in terms of getting a meaning across are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> please</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> please help me</span>. When you say this word you're kind of saying please help me out and I'm relying on you and you're kind of awesome too. Anyways, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> please</span> is a pretty good way to do it. So, when you see this word you'll notice it has the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> request</span> kanji in it. You can guess you're requesting something. What is that thing? It's help (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> please help me</span>) and you're asking very nicely too (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> please</span>).
* You ask for help by saying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> please help me</span>, and that person does try to help you... but the amount they do for you is so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neg</span>ligible that it hardly does anything to help you at all. Please try to help me again, this time better?
