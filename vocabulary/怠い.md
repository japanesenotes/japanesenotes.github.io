## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lazy</span>? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sluggish</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dull</span>. 
* The reading for this word is an exception. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember it:<br />If you're feeling <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sluggish</span> just turn on <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Daru</span>de's (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だる](https://jisho.org/search/だる)</span>) Sandstorm and it will perk you right up. But a world where people don't know Darude's <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6120QOlsfU>Sandstorm</a>  is full of sluggish, dull nerds.
