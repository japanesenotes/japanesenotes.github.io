## Mnemonics:
彼、今日の夜何食べたか知ってる？焼き肉食べ放題に行ったんだよ。最も臭いおならに備えておいた方が身のためだよ。用心に越したことはないんだから。
* Do you know what he ate tonight? He went to an all you can eat yakiniku restaurant. We’d better prepare for the smelliest farts imaginable. Better safe than sorry.
* This is the adverb version of the kanji, so it has the same meaning, basically. You can say this is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> the most</span> or just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> most</span>. You can also use it as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> extremely</span>.
* The reading for this is a reading you didn't learn with the kanji (the kun'yomi reading). To learn it, let's look at a mnemonic. <br />Think of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> the most</span> ridiculous <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> motto</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もっと](https://jisho.org/search/もっと)</span>) you've ever heard. Now imagine a motto that's even more ridiculous. Here are some actual totally real mottos that are the most ridiculous: What Can Brown Do for You? It's Not for Women If It Doesn't Get All Over the Place, It Doesn't Belong in Your Face and of course, Why Not Enjoy the Go?
* 最
