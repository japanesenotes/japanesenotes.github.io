食事代を支払う代わりに皿洗いをすることができるラーメン屋さんが日本にあるって本当ですか？
* Is it true that there is a ramen restaurant in Japan where you can wash dishes to pay your bill?
* You know the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [皿](https://jisho.org/search/皿)</span> (plate) and the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [洗う](https://jisho.org/search/洗う)</span> (to wash), right? You can probably guess dish washing is happening here, but this is a noun, so it's the idea of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dishwashing</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> doing dishes</span>.
* The readings are the individual vocab words (you can tell because there's a bit of hiragana stuck on there). It's the reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [皿](https://jisho.org/search/皿)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [洗う](https://jisho.org/search/洗う)</span> combined.
