## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> conserve</span>... but why stop there when you could try <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to omit</span> everything and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to eliminate</span> everything? Just take exactly what you need, conserve it, and omit everything else.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> have</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はぶ](https://jisho.org/search/はぶ)</span>) what you have, and omit what you don't need. Perfect life.
