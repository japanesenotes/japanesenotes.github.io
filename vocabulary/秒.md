## Mnemonics:
あなたの発音をたったの十二秒でネイティブレベルにしてみせますよ。
* Your pronunciation can reach native-level in just twelve seconds.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* The reading is the same as you learned with the kanji. It's presumably because it's usually attached to other things, like numbers, making it act more like a jukugo word would. Anyway, you should only need a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> second</span> to learn this reading, since you should already know it.
* 秒
* Second
* [sound:秒_b.mp3]
* [sound:秒_g.mp3]
