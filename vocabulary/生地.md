* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Life</span> that comes out of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> earth</span> is made up of different kinds of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> material</span>s. Sometimes it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cloth</span>, sometimes it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dough</span>, but everything has to be made out of something.

You haven't learned either of these readings yet, sorry! Here's some mnemonics to help you:<br />If you want the best <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> material</span> to make clothes or pies out of, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>)is asking <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Je</span>sus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span>)! He knows everything, including where to find the materials for whatever weird thing you're making. Just remember: Who's the key? Jesus!
