## Mnemonics:
緊急の際には、このビルの東口から避難してください。そこでは、コーヒーとドーナツが支給される予定です。
* In the case of an emergency, please evacuate the building through the east exit. There will be coffee and donuts waiting for you there.
* Remember how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [入り口](https://jisho.org/search/入り口)</span> means entrance and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [出口](https://jisho.org/search/出口)</span> means exit? This is just the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [口](https://jisho.org/search/口)</span> part with a direction on it. That means it can be both entrance or exit. So when you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> East</span> up there this word can mean both <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> East exit</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> East entrance</span>. This is a great word to know if you need to know which side of a train station you need to leave on to go somewhere or meet someone!
* This word uses kun'yomi readings, possibly because of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [口](https://jisho.org/search/口)</span>, which is a body part (body parts do that quite a bit in words and kanji). You should hopefully have seen both the kun'yomi readings from previous levels meaning you can read this word as well. Just watch out for the rendaku that changes <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くち](https://jisho.org/search/くち)</span> to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぐち](https://jisho.org/search/ぐち)</span>.
* 東, 口
* East, Mouth
