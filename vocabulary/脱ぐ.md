## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> undress</span> and the verb is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to undress</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: When you go <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to undress</span> your goal is to become <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nu</span>de (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぬ](https://jisho.org/search/ぬ)</span>).
