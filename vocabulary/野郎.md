* Ugh, that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> field</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> guy</span>. He's the worst. Always in the fields, making us look bad, quite the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bastard</span>. Really though, he's just this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> guy</span>, but for some reason I sometimes don't like him.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
