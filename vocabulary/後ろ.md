## Mnemonics:
振り返って後ろを見た後、さらにもう一度振り返ったら、僕のことが見えるよ。
* If you turn around to look behind you and then do it again, you’ll see me.
* The hiragana attached to this word doesn't suggest it's a verb or an adjective, so we can assume it's a noun. While <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [後で](https://jisho.org/search/後で)</span> (you may or may not have seen this word yet) means after, this one means all the other meanings you learned with the kanji: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> behind</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> back</span>, and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rear</span>. Think of the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ろ](https://jisho.org/search/ろ)</span> as a hint. It's like saying you're on the road (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ろ](https://jisho.org/search/ろ)</span>) and you're driving so fast you're leaving everything behind.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Continue to think you're driving on this road. You hit something, then look <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> behind</span> you, seeing you hit a cow. Know the word for cow in Japanese? You should. It's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うし](https://jisho.org/search/うし)</span>, which is also the reading for this word.
* 後
* Behind
* [sound:後ろ_b.mp3]
* [sound:後ろ_g.mp3]
