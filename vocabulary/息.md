## Mnemonics:
水中で息はしないでください。
* Please do not breathe underwater.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: You smell someone's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> icky</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いき](https://jisho.org/search/いき)</span>) <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> breath</span>. It's gross. Your skin crawls and your eyes roll back in your head from the icky, icky smell. You might die.
* 息
* Breath
* [sound:息_b.mp3]
* [sound:息_g.mp3]
