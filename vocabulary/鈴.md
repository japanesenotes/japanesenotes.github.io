## Mnemonics:

* 
* The meaning for this word comes from the kanji. It's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> small bell</span>!
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Someone is ringing a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> small bell</span>, over and over. It's Ichiro <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Suzu</span>ki (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すず](https://jisho.org/search/すず)</span>) being obnoxious, ringing that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> small bell</span>. I think he's trying to get practice started.
