* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [営業](https://jisho.org/search/営業)</span> means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> running a business</span>. You're in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> middle</span> of running a business, which means you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> open for business</span> (otherwise you wouldn't be in the middle of running it, you'd be at the beginning or something).
