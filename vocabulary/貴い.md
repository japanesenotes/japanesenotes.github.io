## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> valuable</span>? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> valuable</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: What is most <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> valuable</span> to you? Of course it's your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> toe toe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうと]([とう]([と](https://jisho.org/search/と)う)と)</span>). It's your big toe (the long <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とう]([と](https://jisho.org/search/と)う)</span>) with another small toe growing out of it (short <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [と](https://jisho.org/search/と)</span>). Imagine your toe toe, and then imagine how valuable it is to you. So valuable! You can also think about <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [尊い](https://jisho.org/search/尊い)</span>, a similar word which means revered. It's a similar idea, and it has the same reading.
