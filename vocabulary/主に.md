## Mnemonics:
彼は研究者で、主にバナナに興味があります。
* He is a researcher who is mainly interested in bananas.
* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [主](https://jisho.org/search/主)</span> means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> main</span> so when you add <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [に](https://jisho.org/search/に)</span> it becomes the adverb <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mainly</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mainly</span> spend your time talking to your master Moe. But you mainly address him like, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Oh Moe</span> The Great! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おも](https://jisho.org/search/おも)</span>). That's because he's above you. Imagine yourself saying OH MOE THE GREAT! as you walk into his room, bowing low.
* 主
* Master
* [sound:主に_b.mp3]
* [sound:主に_g.mp3]
