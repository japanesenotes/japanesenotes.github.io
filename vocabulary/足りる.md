## Mnemonics:
今夜、ワインコルクで何か工作をするのに足りるだけのワインを飲むことを誓います。
* I vow to drink enough wine to make something crafty with the corks tonight.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> leg</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sufficient</span>. Of course, sufficient is the one we're going to go for, because you can't really do foot but you can be sufficient. What's another word for this? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> To be enough</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [た](https://jisho.org/search/た)</span> portion. Whenever we need to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [た](https://jisho.org/search/た)</span> we use the word taco. <br />What do you have enough of? What is sufficient? Turns out it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ta</span>cos (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [た](https://jisho.org/search/た)</span>). Your bunker is filled with them and it's going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be enough</span> to last the winter.
