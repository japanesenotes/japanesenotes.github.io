## Mnemonics:
「ごめんね。君から借りていた恋愛小説をなくしちゃったんだ。」「気にしないでいいよ。それはもう必要ないから。彼女ができたんだ。」
* I’m sorry I lost the romance novel I borrowed from you. Don’t worry about it. I won’t need it anymore anyway. I have a girlfriend now.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> borrow</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to borrow</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Dude, can I borrow your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>)? Please?
* 借
* Borrow
* [sound:借りる_b.mp3]
