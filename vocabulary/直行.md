## Mnemonics:
ごめんなさい、今は話せません。トイレへ直行しているところなのです。
* I’m sorry, I can't talk right now. I’m on a nonstop trip to the bathroom.
* If you think about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> direct</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> go</span>ing (aka transportation) how would you make it better? You'd make it so everything was <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nonstop</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> direct</span>. Just imagine how much nicer it would be if every airplane you took was direct and you never had to stop. So nice!
* This is a jukugo word and uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょく](https://jisho.org/search/ちょく)</span> of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [直](https://jisho.org/search/直)</span> is shortened with a small <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [っ](https://jisho.org/search/っ)</span>, though, so make sure to take note of that.
* 直, 行
* Fix, Go
* [sound:直行_b.mp3]
* [sound:直行_g.mp3]
