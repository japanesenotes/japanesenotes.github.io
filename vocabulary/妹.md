## Mnemonics:
私の妹は、バービー人形にウィッグを作ってあげたいからと、自分の髪の毛を切った。
* My younger sister just cut off all of her hair so she could make wigs for her Barbie dolls.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> younger sister</span> is really into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> emote</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いもうと](https://jisho.org/search/いもうと)</span>). Look up this word if you're not a teenage girl. Just imagine her sending you these on your phone over and over. You tell your younger sister: HEY, STOP SENDING ME EMOTES.
* 妹
* Younger Sister
* [sound:妹_b.mp3]
