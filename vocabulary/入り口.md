## Mnemonics:
入り口にジョニーデップがいるよ。
* Johnny Depp is at the entrance.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mouth</span> that you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> enter</span> is an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> entrance</span>.
* Because there's some okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) attached, you can bet that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [入り](https://jisho.org/search/入り)</span> will be a kun'yomi reading. This reading comes from the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [入れる](https://jisho.org/search/入れる)</span>. If you know that word already, this one will be easy. If not, then you'll have to think that the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> entrance</span> you're going in is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eerie</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いり](https://jisho.org/search/いり)</span>). Then, because this word is really two separate words put together to form one word, you can guess that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [口](https://jisho.org/search/口)</span> also uses the kun'yomi reading, though the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [く](https://jisho.org/search/く)</span> in <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [く](https://jisho.org/search/く)ち</span> changes to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぐ](https://jisho.org/search/ぐ)</span> due to something called rendaku. Just remember that it's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぐ](https://jisho.org/search/ぐ)ち</span> and not <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [く](https://jisho.org/search/く)ち</span> here.
* 入, 口
* Enter, Mouth
