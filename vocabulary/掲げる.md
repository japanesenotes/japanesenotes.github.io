* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> display</span>, so if you're doing the action of displaying something, you're going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to put up</span> something, or, sometimes more specifically, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to put up a sign</span>.
* You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to put up</span> a sign for your newest invention, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かか](https://jisho.org/search/かか)</span>). It is a car made so that other cars can drive the car. Nobody wants to buy it, which is why you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to put up a sign</span>.
