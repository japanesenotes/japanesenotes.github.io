## Mnemonics:
「これを書き直す時間があると思う？」「私はそうは思わないね。」
* Do you think we have enough time to rewrite this? I don’t think so.
* If you take your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> writing</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fix</span> it, you are taking your writing and rewriting it. This word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to rewrite</span>, because the fixing is really heavy, so regular revisions won't do.
* The readings come from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [書く](https://jisho.org/search/書く)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [直す](https://jisho.org/search/直す)</span>. Know those and you'll know how to read this word too!
* 書, 直
* Write, Fix
* [sound:書き直す_b.mp3]
* [sound:書き直す_g.mp3]
