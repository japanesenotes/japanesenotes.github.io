## Mnemonics:
ビエトはシュークリームがとっても好きなので、毎日少なくとも一個は食べます。
* Viet likes cream puffs so much that he eats at least one every single day.
* The counter <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [個](https://jisho.org/search/個)</span>, which means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> individual</span> on its own, refers to an individual thing. This is usually a small thing, so it's used to count small things. This word here talks about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> one</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> individual</span>. A better way to translate that would be to call it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> one small thing</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いち](https://jisho.org/search/いち)</span> gets shortened, but I bet you knew that already.
* 一, 個
* One, Individual
