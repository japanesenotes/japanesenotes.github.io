## Mnemonics:
仕事が決まったのかどうかは未だ分からないんだ。向こうは未だ、十二人も面接しなきゃいけないみたい。
* I’m not sure if I got the job yet. It seems like they still have to interview twelve other applicants.
* This is the adverb version of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 未</span>, meaning it means the same thing: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> not yet</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Someone's telling you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> not yet</span>... not yet.... not yet... you have some food on your nose, but you're not allowed to eat it until your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ma</span> says it's okay. Not yet... Not yet... Why would your mom treat you like a dog like this? Oh well... maybe she'll let you eat the food soon, at least.
* 未
* Not Yet
* [sound:未だ_b.mp3]
* [sound:未だ_g.mp3]
