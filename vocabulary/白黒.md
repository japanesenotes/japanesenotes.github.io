## Mnemonics:
カナエちゃんがいつもオシャレな服装をしているってことは認めるけどさ、今日の白黒のドレスはちょっとなんかパンダみたいじゃない？
* I agree that Kanae always wears very chic clothes, but today that black and white dress just makes her look like a panda, doesn’t it?
* Something is both <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> white</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> black</span>. It is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> black and white</span> (you can also say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> white and black</span> if you prefer).
* The readings are kun'yomi, but you should have seen both <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [白](https://jisho.org/search/白)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [黒い](https://jisho.org/search/黒い)</span> separately as vocabulary by now. It's the same readings here, so you can apply that knowledge and read this word!
* 白, 黒
* White, Black
