## Mnemonics:
いいから黙って今すぐ来い!
* Be quiet and come over at once!
* You'll have to learn this word in two parts. You already know the meaning of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [今](https://jisho.org/search/今)</span> because of the kanji, which means now. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すぐ](https://jisho.org/search/すぐ)</span> part, however, is a new word, meaning soon. The two words even start with the same soo sound. If you put these two together, you get now soon. Put in better English, that's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> at once</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> right now</span>.
* Since you already know the vocab word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [今](https://jisho.org/search/今)</span> (read <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いま](https://jisho.org/search/いま)</span>), you should be able to read this word as well.
* 今
* Now
* [sound:今すぐ_b.mp3]
* [sound:今すぐ_g.mp3]
