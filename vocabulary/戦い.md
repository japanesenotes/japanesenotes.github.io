## Mnemonics:
彼はマクドナルドに行く途中、血みどろの戦いに遭遇したが、その後そのままビッグマックを食べに行った。
* On the way to McDonald’s he got in a bloody fight but that didn’t stop him from getting his Big Mac.
* Don't let this word confuse you. It may end in <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>, but it's not an adjective, it's a noun. There are no rules in war, after all. This word describes what happens in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> war</span>. Those things are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> battle</span>s, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fight</span>s, and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> conflict</span>s.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />In a fierce <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> battle</span>, there's always a lot of collateral damage. One of the things that gets destroyed is your car. But you can't do anything about it, it's battle time! So you wave goodbye to your car saying, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ta ta ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たたか](https://jisho.org/search/たたか)</span>)! as you punch some jerk in the face.
* 戦
* War
