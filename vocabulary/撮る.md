## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> photograph</span>. When you make that into a verb, you are doing a photograph, aka making it become <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to take a picture</span>. It can also be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to film</span> as well. Really anything to do with a camera.
* Think of the reading like you do the meaning <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to take a photograph</span>. You take all these things, and how do you say to take in Japanese? It's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [取る](https://jisho.org/search/取る)</span>, aka <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> とる</span>, which happens to be the same reading!
* 撮
* Photograph
* [sound:撮る_b.mp3]
* [sound:撮る_g.mp3]
