## Mnemonics:

* 
* I'm so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bored</span>. On top of my boredom is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くまでも](https://jisho.org/search/くまでも)</span>. If you took this separately, it would mean even as a bear. So it's like you're saying I'm so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bored</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> even if I was a bear</span>. If you're so bored that you'd be bored even as a bear, you're going to be bored <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to the last</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to the end</span>. Nothing will please you, you bored bear person.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading already when you learned <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [飽きる](https://jisho.org/search/飽きる)</span> so you should be able to read this one too!
* 飽
* Bored
