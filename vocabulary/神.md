## Mnemonics:
神様は水の上を歩けるかもしれないけど、俺は陸の上を泳ぐことができるんだぜ。
* God may be able to walk on water. But I can swim on land.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />Do you know the word Kamikaze? Also, do you remember the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [風](https://jisho.org/search/風)</span> from a previous level? Kamikaze means divine winds or godly winds. If you know the word Kamikaze you can apply it to this single word, that means god or gods. Use your prior knowledge to remember this reading.
* 神
* God
* [sound:神_b.mp3]
* [sound:神_g.mp3]
