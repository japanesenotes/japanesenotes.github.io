* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> favor</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to do a favor</span> for.
* If you are going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to do a favor</span> for anyone, it's going to be for your good buddy <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> meg</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [めぐ](https://jisho.org/search/めぐ)</span>). Imagine a Meg you know (or know of) and imagine yourself doing a favor for her. Meg Ryan is so happy you're in her life.
