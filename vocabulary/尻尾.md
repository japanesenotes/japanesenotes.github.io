## Mnemonics:

* 
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> butt</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tail</span> is just your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tail</span>, though I wonder why they had to specify that it was your butt tail. Where else do you have a tail, I wonder?
* The reading for this word is a bit of an exception. You kind of already know the reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [尻](https://jisho.org/search/尻)</span> from the kun'yomi <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しり](https://jisho.org/search/しり)</span> you learned already. Here it gets shortened to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しっ](https://jisho.org/search/しっ)</span>. The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [尾](https://jisho.org/search/尾)</span> is totally different from what you learned, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />The animal with the best <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tail</span> in the world is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> po</span>lar (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぽ](https://jisho.org/search/ぽ)</span>) bear. They're stubby and white and cute. Only polar bears have tails like that!
* 尻, 尾
* Butt, Tail
