## Mnemonics:
テストは70点が合格点だったが、私は69点だったのにも関わらずお情けで合格させてもらえた。
* I needed a 70 to pass the test, and even though I got a 69, I was given a pity pass.
* You have your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> feeling</span>s... these are the feelings humans have. When you ask someone to have feelings (Have feelings, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> KAY</span>?? (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [け](https://jisho.org/search/け)</span> at the end)), you are asking them to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pity</span> or have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mercy</span> on you. Please! Have those human feelings that people have, like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sympathy</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pity</span>. Don't kill me, man!
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: Who are you begging to have pity on you? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> NASA</span>. They have you hanging outside of the space station and they're going to push you towards earth where you'll burn up in the atmosphere. You don't want that, so you beg mission control for some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pity</span>. What will they do? You decide.
