## Mnemonics:
もし壊れていなければ、それを直そうとする必要はないよ。
* You don’t need to fix something if it’s not broken.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fix</span> so this vocab word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to fix</span>. This is when you're fixing something, as in doing the actual physical action of fixing.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have to learn the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なお](https://jisho.org/search/なお)</span> part. Think of it this way. You need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to fix</span> something! It's urgent! You have to fix it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> now</span>! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なお](https://jisho.org/search/なお)</span>). This will also work with the similar word, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [直る](https://jisho.org/search/直る)</span>, which you'll learn soon if you haven't already.
* 直
* Fix
* [sound:直す_b.mp3]
* [sound:直す_g.mp3]
