## Mnemonics:
私の旦那さんの性格はのんびり屋で、忘れっぽくて、優柔不断です。彼のことは大好きだけど、たまにイラッとくるんだよね。
* My husband is really easy going, but forgetful and indecisive. I love him but sometimes it drives me nuts.
* For some reason the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> status</span> of your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gender</span> is what dictates your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> personality</span>. Think of it this way: What kind of personality does someone of the female gender usually have? What about the personality of a male gender? Their personality status always seems to fit into gender roles, which is why the status of the gender dictates the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> personality</span>. Make sense?
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 性, 格
* Gender, Status
* [sound:性格_b.mp3]
* [sound:性格_g.mp3]
