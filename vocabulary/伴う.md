* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accompany</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to accompany</span>. This can be used both literally and figuratively.
* You need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to accompany</span> your friend, so to call out to them you yell <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [友](https://jisho.org/search/友)</span>, NOW</span>! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ともなう](https://jisho.org/search/ともなう)</span>) to command them to come near you to accompany you to somewhere else.
