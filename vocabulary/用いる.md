## Mnemonics:
えをかくために用いるふでで、かの女をくすぐった。
* I tickled her with a brush used for painting.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Task</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> use</span>. This verb is like a more formal way to say use, and that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to utilize</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to learn the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もち](https://jisho.org/search/もち)</span> portion of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もち](https://jisho.org/search/もち)いる</span>: <br />What will you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> utilize</span> to get the job done? You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mochi</span> in your hand, so you'll use that. Now go think of some kind of imaginary task you'll complete with mochi, making it as ridiculous as possible.
