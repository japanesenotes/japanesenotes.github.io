## Mnemonics:
アメリカのインド料理は、アメリカ人の口に合うよう、実際のインドでの調理方法とはかなり違った方法で作られている。
* Indian cuisine in America is altered quite a bit from how it’s prepared in India to suit American tastes.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suit</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to suit</span>. <br />This word also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to come together</span> as well. Presumably when something suits something else, it comes together with it flawlessly. That's why this word also has this other meaning (and it will be important for future vocab as well).
* You want to find a pet <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to suit</span> your personal style, so you get matched with an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a</span>ardvark (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あ](https://jisho.org/search/あ)</span>). An aardvark will match the ant mounds you use for chairs and couches, it's the perfect match.
