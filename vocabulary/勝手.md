## Mnemonics:
「サーモン！フグは五回も浮気したんだよ。そんな男のこと、信じちゃダメだってば。」「分かってるんだけど、でも、彼、私がいないと生きていけないって言うの。」「じゃあ、もう、勝手にすれば！」
* Salmon! Fugu cheated on you five times. Never trust a guy like that. I know… but he says he can’t live without me. Well, suit yourself then!
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hand</span> (or person, as you know <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [手](https://jisho.org/search/手)</span> often refers to a person) that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> win</span>s gets to do <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> as one pleases</span>.
* The reading for this is weird. It's all kun'yomi, which luckily you've seen before, but still strange. I guess when you do <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> as one pleases</span> you can read kanji however you want, in this case the kun'yomi readings. Do note that there's a small <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [っ](https://jisho.org/search/っ)</span> in there before, presumably to connect the two readings of the two kanji together.
* 勝, 手
* Win, Hand
