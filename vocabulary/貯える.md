## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> savings</span>, so the verb vocab version would become <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to save</span> or to put something aside. Basically, you're saving up, which is good to do, I'm told.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to save</span>, so you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> take one</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たくわ](https://jisho.org/search/たくわ)</span>) and put it aside, then take another and use it. This way you will have saved at least half.
