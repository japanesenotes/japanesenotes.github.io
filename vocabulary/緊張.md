* When your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tense</span>ness is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stretch</span>ed out as far as it is, it becomes not just tenseness, but <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stress</span> as well. The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tension</span> is crazy when you stretch it out like this! 
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
