## Mnemonics:
漢字の音訓ってすごく紛らわしいので嫌いです。
* The Japanese and Chinese readings for kanji are so confusing, I hate them.
* You've seen (hopefully) <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [音読み](https://jisho.org/search/音読み)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [訓読み](https://jisho.org/search/訓読み)</span>. This is a combination of the two. This is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> on'yomi and kun'yomi</span>, aka the Chinese and Japanese readings.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 音, 訓
* Sound, Instruction
