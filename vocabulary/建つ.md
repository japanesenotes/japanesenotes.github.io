サーモンと僕は、浜辺の北端に建つ家を買おうと相談してるんですが、ちょっと私達には値段が高いんですよね。
* Salmon and I are discussing buying a pre-built home at the north end of the beach, but it’s a little expensive for us.
* You know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [建てる](https://jisho.org/search/建てる)</span> is to build. This is similar to that, but it's the version where you're not doing the building. Something is just getting built. That's why this word is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be erected</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be built</span>. You can recognize that because of the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>, which tells you that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>) guys are building the building while you watch. So you're not doing it, they are, and it's just happening.
* The reading is shared with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [建てる](https://jisho.org/search/建てる)</span>, so if you know <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [建てる](https://jisho.org/search/建てる)</span> then you should be able to read this word as well.
* 建
* Build
