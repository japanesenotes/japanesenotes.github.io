## Mnemonics:
どんなに大変でも、私は自分の夢を追い続けるつもりなの。もし私の夫になりたいなら、そのことを理解してもらいたいの。
* I’ll follow my dream no matter how hard it is and I want you to understand that if you are going to be my husband.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> follow</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to follow</span> (it's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to chase</span>, because when you follow something you are chasing it too).
* You've learned this reading already, so you should know how to read this word!
* 追
* Follow
* [sound:追う_b.mp3]
* [sound:追う_g.mp3]
