## Mnemonics:
私達の果樹園にはあり余るほどの林檎があります。
* There is an abundance of apples in our orchard.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> surplus</span> so the verb version would be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be in surplus</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to remain left over</span>. Too much!
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: I have a surplus of kittens from that last batch we made, Reddit. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> AMA</span> (ask me anything, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あま](https://jisho.org/search/あま)</span>).
* 余
* Surplus
* [sound:余る_b.mp3]
* [sound:余る_g.mp3]
