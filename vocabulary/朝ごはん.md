## Mnemonics:
滅茶苦茶お腹が空いていて、朝ごはんに腐った卵を６つも食べてしまったこと、今までにある？
* Have you ever been so hungry that you ate six rotten eggs for breakfast?
* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ごはん](https://jisho.org/search/ごはん)</span> is a food or meal (maybe you'll learn the kanji for it later, but it's not usually used, so you're learning it this way now). What is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> morning</span> meal? That is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> breakfast</span> (not to be confused with second breakfast, you hobbit).
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あさ](https://jisho.org/search/あさ)</span> is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, meaning you should be able to read everything here.
* 朝
* Morning
