## Mnemonics:

* 
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> machine</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gulf</span> isn't what you'd expect. In fact, looking at the reading will probably help the most first, since this word represents <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Taiwan</span>.
* The reading is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たい](https://jisho.org/search/たい)</span> for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [台](https://jisho.org/search/台)</span>, which is a little different from what you learned, but not the end of the world (especially if you can get the meaning down). The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わん](https://jisho.org/search/わん)</span> is however what you learned, so even if you arrive to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だいわん](https://jisho.org/search/だいわん)</span>, you'll probably realize that this is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たい](https://jisho.org/search/たい)わん</span>.
* 台, 湾
* Machine, Gulf
