本州がどこか分からなければ、パソコンでしらべたらどうですか？
* If you don't know where Honshu is, why don't you look it up on your computer?
* You have your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> origin</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> state</span>. For Japan (since this is a Japanese word), that would be the main island, the big one in the middle: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Honshu</span>. You'll have to know some minor Japanese geography for this. Go look at a map of Japan and study it over real quick to see where I'm talking about if you don't know already.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 本, 州
* Book, State
