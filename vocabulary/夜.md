## Mnemonics:
夜には、モンスターたちが床から這い上がり、私のベッドの下でお茶会を開くんだよ。
* Night is the time when monsters crawl up through the floor to have tea parties under my bed.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />It is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> night</span>, but it is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> your</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よる](https://jisho.org/search/よる)</span>) night.
* 夜
* Night
* [sound:夜_b.mp3]
* [sound:夜_g.mp3]
