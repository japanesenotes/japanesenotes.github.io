## Mnemonics:
この書道字典はあそこの古本屋で買ったんです。
* I bought this calligraphy dictionary at a secondhand bookstore over there.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rule</span>s for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> letter</span>s can be found in a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> character dictionary</span>. In Japanese, one letter or character can have a lot of information (we're talking kanji here). That means you need dictionaries for these individual letters as well! That's what this is.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 字, 典
* Letter, Rule
