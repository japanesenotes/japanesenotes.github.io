## Mnemonics:

* 
* Remember how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [増える](https://jisho.org/search/増える)</span> is to increase (as in, something just increases, you aren't doing the increasing yourself). This one is that one, where you're doing the increasing. So, this word means to increase something. You know you're doing the increasing because you said yes (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [やす](https://jisho.org/search/やす)</span>) to increasing something, and did it yourself.
* The reading is the same like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [増える](https://jisho.org/search/増える)</span>. If you know that vocab word you probably can read this one as well.
