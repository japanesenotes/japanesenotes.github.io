## Mnemonics:
ママは狂って、人参で僕のおしりを何度もひどく打った。
* My mom went crazy and pounded my butt with a carrot.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hit</span> so the vocab is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to hit</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to pound</span>.
* This word uses the kun'yomi reading, which you haven't learned yet, but never fear! A mnemonic is here:<br />Something is coming toward your face. It's black and spiky and it's definitely going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to hit</span> you right in the eye. It's an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> u</span>ni (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span>). Have you ever seen one of those things before? You definitely aren't going to be happy with whoever is trying to hit you with an uni.
