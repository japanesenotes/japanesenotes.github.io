* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fat</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flat</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ocean</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Pacific Ocean</span>. I guess it's fatter than the Atlantic? Whatever it is, it's the ocean that China/Japan would have known the most about when they were coming up with words and kanji, which is why this is the Pacific, not the Atlantic.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 太, 平, 洋
