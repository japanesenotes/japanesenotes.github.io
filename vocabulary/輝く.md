## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> radiance</span>. Imagine if something is radiating on something else. That would cause it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to shine</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to glitter</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to sparkle</span>.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cog yak</span> is so shiny. It so shiny it starts <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to shine</span> and glitter. I don't know what a cog yak is, but imagine it in your head and imagine it being super shiny, shining off shines and glitter.
