## Mnemonics:
学ぶことは大切だけど、おそらくもっと大切なのはどのように学ぶかということじゃないだろうか。
* Learning is important, but perhaps what’s more important is how you learn.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> study</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> learning</span>. When you do these things, what ends up happening? You learn. That's why this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to learn</span>. <br />There is another word that means to learn that is going to be more common, which is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [習う](https://jisho.org/search/習う)</span>. You'll learn this one later on. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [学ぶ](https://jisho.org/search/学ぶ)</span> sounds a little more serious compared to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [習う](https://jisho.org/search/習う)</span>, so keep that in mind when you use it.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まな](https://jisho.org/search/まな)</span> part to learn this word's reading. Think about a class you're taking. It's a manners class, and you're there <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to learn</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> manner</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まな](https://jisho.org/search/まな)</span>). Imagine this study of manners and imagine yourself practicing it.
