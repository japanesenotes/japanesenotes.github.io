## Mnemonics:
今から、ヘルメットにおはようといいます。
* Now I’m going to say good morning to my helmet.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />What'll you drink now? I'll have a Zima, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ima</span>.<br />Say ZIMA IMA ten times fast.
* 今
* Now
* [sound:今_b.mp3]
* [sound:今_g.mp3]
