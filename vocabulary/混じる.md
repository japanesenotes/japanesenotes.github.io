## Mnemonics:

* 
* This one is a little strange. You have <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [混む]([混](https://jisho.org/search/混)む)</span> (To Be Crowded), <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [混ぜる]([混](https://jisho.org/search/混)ぜる)</span> (to mix), <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [混ざる]([混](https://jisho.org/search/混)ざる)</span> (to get mixed), and now this: <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [混じる]([混](https://jisho.org/search/混)じる)</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> To Get Mixed Up In</span>. It makes sense because it has to do with mixing, but how to differentiate from the rest? Well, for this one just imagine <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Je</span>sus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span>) getting mixed up in a pot of soup. He's getting mixed up in this giant pot of soup because someone thinks that if they eat him, they'll gain his powers.
* The reading is the same as (almost) all the other <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [混](https://jisho.org/search/混)</span> verbs. All about mamamamama!
* 混
* Mix
