## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stuffed</span>, this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to stuff in</span>, as in you're doing the stuffing. You know that this is the case because when it comes to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mail</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [める](https://jisho.org/search/める)</span>), you stuff that mail into the garbage as hard as you can (it's all junk).
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You learned that reading with the kanji, so you should have no troubles here.
* 詰
* Stuffed
