## Mnemonics:
「どうぞ、お熱いうちにお召し上がりくださいね。」「有難うございます。でも、ええっと、ちょっと熱すぎるので、まだ食べられません。」
* Please eat it while it’s hot. Thank you, but... well, it’s so hot that we can’t eat it yet.
* This is for when a thing is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hot</span>, making this word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hot thing</span>. When the weather is hot that's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [暑い]([暑](https://jisho.org/search/暑)い)</span>. This is when you touch something and you burn yourself.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: This has the same reading as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [暑い]([暑](https://jisho.org/search/暑)い)</span>, so if you've learned that you'll know how to read this word as well. If you haven't run into that word, you've probably run into the kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [暑](https://jisho.org/search/暑)</span> at least. That uses the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あつ](https://jisho.org/search/あつ)</span>. Two similar concepts, but there are two kanji to differentiate, which gets confusing. 
* 熱
* Heat
