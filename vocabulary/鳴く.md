## Mnemonics:
今夜、あの新しい洒落た日本食レストランに行こうよ。知ってた？あそこには、ホーホケキョと美しい声で鳴く鶯も何羽かいるんだぜ。
* Let’s go to the new, chic Japanese restaurant tonight. Did you know that it has a few cute Japanese bush warblers singing with their beautiful voices?
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chirp</span> so the verb vocab version would be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to chirp</span>. Alternatively, this word can also be used for the sounds other animals make as well, though the primary definition has to do with birds chirping (it has bird right in the kanji, after all).
* The reading is the same reading as the one you learned with the kanji. So, spend more time chirping and less time memorizing, okay?
* 鳴
* Chirp
* [sound:鳴く_b.mp3]
* [sound:鳴く_g.mp3]
