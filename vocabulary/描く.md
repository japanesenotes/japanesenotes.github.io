## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> draw</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to draw</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to sketch</span>.
* The reading is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [書く](https://jisho.org/search/書く)</span>, which is similar to drawing something (you use a writing instrument on a piece of paper, which you can do with drawing). Another reading is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [えがく](https://jisho.org/search/えがく)</span>, which is like saying <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [絵を書く](https://jisho.org/search/絵を書く)</span>, but combined and rendaku'd.
* 描
* Draw
* [sound:描く_b.mp3]
* [sound:描く_g.mp3]
