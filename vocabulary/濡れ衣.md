## Mnemonics:
濡れ衣だったと信じてくれたのは、飼い犬だけだった。
* The only one who believed that it was a false accusation was my dog.
* Ah yes, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wet</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clothes</span> must be wet clothes-NOT! This used to mean wet clothes a long, long time ago, but these days it's used for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> false accusations</span>. Think of it this way: if you make false, baseless accusations, it's like you're dumping water all over someone for no reason. They weren't on fire, they didn't need to bathe, but now they have to deal with the consequences of wet clothes (and they didn't even do anything!).
* This word is made up of the readings for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [濡れる](https://jisho.org/search/濡れる)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [衣](https://jisho.org/search/衣)</span> put together. You know them both, so you should be able to read this already.
* 濡, 衣
* Wet, Clothes
* [sound:濡れ衣_b.mp3]
