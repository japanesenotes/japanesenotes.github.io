## Mnemonics:
ヨーロッパの街は、次々と疫病に侵されていった。
* One by one, the cities of Europe fell to the plague.
* When something is happening <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> next</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> next</span> (next next next), it's happening <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> in succession</span>, or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> one by one</span>. Just imagine a line of people going through to get stamps on their heads. The person at the stamp counter is saying Next! Next! and then shouting C'mon people, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> one by one</span>, alright?
* The reading is the same as the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [次](https://jisho.org/search/次)</span> (so it's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つぎ](https://jisho.org/search/つぎ)</span>), but this time you do it twice. No strange rendaku or anything like that either, which makes everyone happier.
* 次, 々
* Next, Repeater
* [sound:次々_b.mp3]
* [sound:次々_g.mp3]
