## Mnemonics:
あやまりを正すことができれば、ごほうびをあげるわ。
* If you can correct my mistakes, I’ll give you a reward.
* This word is made up of a kanji with some hiragana attached, ending in an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound. That means this word is a verb. The kanji itself means correct, so what is the verb form of that? It would be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to correct</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />After you correct something for someone, you yell out <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ta da</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ただ](https://jisho.org/search/ただ)</span>) very excitedly. Go ahead and imagine yourself doing this a few times to help you to remember.
