## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> retreat</span>. The verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to withdraw from</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to retreat</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You try <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to withdraw</span> the enema from your patients' <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 尻s</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しりぞ](https://jisho.org/search/しりぞ)</span>). They have lots of poop that needs to be cleared, and there are a lot of them, which is why there are so many <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [尻s](https://jisho.org/search/尻s)</span>.
