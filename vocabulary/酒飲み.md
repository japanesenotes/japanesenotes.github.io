## Mnemonics:
彼は大酒飲みだが、赤ワインが苦手だ。
* He’s a heavy drinker but he doesn’t like red wine.
* You've seen <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [飲む]([飲](https://jisho.org/search/飲)む)</span>, so you know this has to do with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> drink</span>ing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alcohol</span>. Someone who's known as someone who drinks alcohol is an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alcoholic</span>.
* The readings are the vocab words <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お酒](https://jisho.org/search/お酒)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [飲む]([飲](https://jisho.org/search/飲)む)</span> combined together into one. You can guess it's a kun'yomi reading because of the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [み](https://jisho.org/search/み)</span> on the end of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [飲](https://jisho.org/search/飲)</span>, which should make you think back to vocab words that use these kanji and the kun'yomi readings. If you can do that, you can read this word (and many others, probably!).
* 酒, 飲
* Alcohol, Drink
* [sound:酒飲み_b.mp3]
* [sound:酒飲み_g.mp3]
