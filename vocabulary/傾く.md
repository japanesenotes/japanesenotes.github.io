## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lean</span>, and the verb vocab version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be leaned</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be tilted</span>. You aren't doing the leaning or the tilting, though, you're just watching, which is why you say cool (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [く](https://jisho.org/search/く)</span>) when you see it, because it's already done.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cut a moo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かたむ](https://jisho.org/search/かたむ)</span>), that is, a cow, in half. Then you request it is leaned up against the fence so you can start harvesting its meat for sustenance.
