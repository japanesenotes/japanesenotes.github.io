Tofuguソフトボールチームに入る際の第一規則は、虚栄心をベンチに置いておくことです。
* The first rule of Tofugu’s softball team is that you have to leave your vanity on the bench.
* When how much you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prosper</span> goes into your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> heart</span> and just enters a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> void</span>, it will rarely mean anything to you. A person who has this trait is going to have extreme <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> vanity</span> because he/she just needs to suck more and more prosperity into their bottomless pit of a heart. It's like a black hole. They need more and more and more so then they have to become vain.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 虚, 栄, 心
* Void, Prosper, Heart
