* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> appearance</span> has many <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> degree</span>s. You turn it up a dial, and you show off one <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attitude</span>. Then you turn it down a degree and you have another <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attitude</span>. So many attitudes to show off.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
