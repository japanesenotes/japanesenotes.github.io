## Mnemonics:
私は読書よりも運動の方が好きなので、本も、新聞も、雑誌も読みません。
* I read neither books, nor newspapers, nor magazines because I like exercising more than reading.
* When you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> carry</span> your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> move</span>ments (or carry something along with your movements, like weights, for example) you are doing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exercise</span>. Speaking of which, perhaps you've been studying kanji a little too much lately. Time to get up and do some squats.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 運, 動
* Carry, Move
