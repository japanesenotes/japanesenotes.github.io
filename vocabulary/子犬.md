子犬ごっこをしましょうよ。
* Let’s pretend we’re puppies!
* A child dog is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> puppy</span>!
* Even though this is a jukugo word, it doesn't use the on'yomi readings. Both the kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [犬](https://jisho.org/search/犬)</span> often favor kun'yomi readings, and this word is no exception. The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [犬](https://jisho.org/search/犬)</span> is the one you already know, and the reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span> as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span> is a really common one (perhaps you've already learned that reading?). If not, just think about punching a puppy in the face, and giving it a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> KO</span> (That's a knock out).
* 子, 犬
* Child, Dog
