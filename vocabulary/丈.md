## Mnemonics:
話を変える訳じゃないんだけど、そのスカートはちょっと丈が長過ぎるんじゃないかしら？
* Not to change the subject, but isn’t that skirt just a little too long for you?
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This word is usually used for clothing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> height</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> length</span>.
* The reading is different from what you learned with the kanji. Remember the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [竹](https://jisho.org/search/竹)</span>? It has the same reading as this. Just think of everyone measuring the heights of things with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bamboo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たけ](https://jisho.org/search/たけ)</span>) poles with markers on them. Okay, this one is 5 bamboo poles high!
