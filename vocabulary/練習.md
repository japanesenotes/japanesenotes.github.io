## Mnemonics:
僕が世界ランキング一位を維持し続けているのは、日本語を毎日七時間練習しているからだと思います。
* I believe the reason I continue being ranked number one in the world is that I devote seven hours a day to practicing Japanese.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> practice</span> something to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> learn</span> it. That's still called <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> practice</span>! The important part about this is that you're learning while you practice too. It's right in the word. So, when you practice kanji and Japanese vocab, make sure you're learning as well as practicing. If you're not learning, you're not really practicing, are you?
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 練, 習
* Practice, Learn
