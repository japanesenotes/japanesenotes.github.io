## Mnemonics:
引きがねを引いて、フライパンをうった。
* I pulled the trigger and shot the frying pan.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pull</span> and the verb version vocab means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to pull</span>.<br />This word has another meaning! When you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pull</span> numbers away from other numbers, what you're really doing is subtracting them. That's why this word also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to subtract</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. The reading (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひ](https://jisho.org/search/ひ)</span>) is the same as the one you learned for the kanji, meaning you should already know it!
