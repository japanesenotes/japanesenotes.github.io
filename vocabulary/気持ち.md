## Mnemonics:
これ、つまらないものですが。ささやかな感謝の気持ちです。どうぞ、開けてみてください。
* Here’s a little something for you. This is just a small token of my appreciation. Go ahead, open it.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> energy</span> you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hold</span> in your body is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> feeling</span>s. It can take the form of all kinds of things. Good feelings, bad feelings, that strange feeling.<br />Now, don't confuse this with the future vocab word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [気持ちいい]([気](https://jisho.org/search/気)持ちいい)</span> which means good feeling. This one just means feeling because it doesn't have an adjective attached to it, telling you more about this feeling that you're having.
* The readings are the same as the ones you learned with the kanji, though <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [気](https://jisho.org/search/気)</span> is on'yomi and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [持ち](https://jisho.org/search/持ち)</span> is kun'yomi. One of those weird exception readings, but it'll work out for you anyway, as long as you're studying the kanji well enough.
* 気, 持
* Energy, Hold
* [sound:気持ち_b.mp3]
* [sound:気持ち_g.mp3]
