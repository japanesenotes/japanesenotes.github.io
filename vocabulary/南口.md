## Mnemonics:
新宿南口でナンパされた。
* I was hit on at the south exit of Shinjuku station.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> South</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mouth</span> isn't actually a mouth you find in the south pole or anything, it's an entrance or exit. This is kind of like how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [入り口](https://jisho.org/search/入り口)</span> means entrance (the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [口](https://jisho.org/search/口)</span> represents a doorway). You'll see this word a lot in places like train stations or airports. It means both <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> South exit</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> South entrance</span>.
* The reading for these kanji are both kun'yomi. Probably because it's two words put together (South + Exit) rather than a single word. Also, body parts tend to change words into kun'yomi readings as well. So, you've seen vocab words that give you the kun'yomi reading of both <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [南](https://jisho.org/search/南)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [口](https://jisho.org/search/口)</span>, right? Now you just need to combine the two vocab readings into one to be able to read this word. Just watch out for the rendaku that changes <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くち](https://jisho.org/search/くち)</span> to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぐち](https://jisho.org/search/ぐち)</span>.
* 南, 口
* South, Mouth
* [sound:南口_b.mp3]
* [sound:南口_g.mp3]
