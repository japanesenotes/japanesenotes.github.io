## Mnemonics:
豆腐と河豚を交ぜるのは危険です。
* It’s dangerous to mix tofu and puffer fish.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mix</span> so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to mix</span>. <br />There are similar words to this one, including <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [交じる](https://jisho.org/search/交じる)</span> which means to be mixed and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [交わる](https://jisho.org/search/交わる)</span> which means to intersect. This one is when you're doing the mixing. Like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [交じる](https://jisho.org/search/交じる)</span>, the connotation is that the things being mixed are distinguishable from each other, like two types of fish, or books being mixed together. They don't become homogenous like paint or something would.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ま](https://jisho.org/search/ま)</span> portion. Who would mix things for you (like cakes and other goodies) growing up? That would be your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ma</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ま](https://jisho.org/search/ま)</span>).
