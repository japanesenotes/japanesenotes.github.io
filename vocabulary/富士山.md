## Mnemonics:

* 
* Did you know that the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mountain</span> that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rich</span> in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> samurai</span> happens to be Japan's most famous mountain? It makes sense considering samurai are probably Japan's most famous thing as well. Combine the two most famous things and you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Mt Fuji</span> (or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Mount Fuji</span> if you'd rather write it that way).
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
* 富, 士, 山
* Rich, Samurai, Mountain
