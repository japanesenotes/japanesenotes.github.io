## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suck</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to suck</span>, but it's usually used to talk about what you do to cigarettes, so a better translation I think is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to smoke</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You smoke too much, and that gives you cancer. You decide to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span>) the cigarette makers.
* 吸
* Suck
