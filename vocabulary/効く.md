## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> effective</span>. The verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be effective</span> (since to effective doesn't make sense).
* What is particularly effective? It's your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>). It's effective at opening your house door.
