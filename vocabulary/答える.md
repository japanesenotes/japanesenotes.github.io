## Mnemonics:
面接官に今までに嘘をついたことがあるかどうか聞かれた時に、何て答えればいいのか分からなかったよ。
* I didn’t know how to answer when the interviewer asked me if I have ever lied before.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> answer</span> so the verb version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to answer</span>.
* The reading is the kun'yomi reading as you'd expect with all the hiragana, but luckily that's the reading you learned with the kanji so you should be able to read this.
* 答
* Answer
* [sound:答える_b.mp3]
* [sound:答える_g.mp3]
