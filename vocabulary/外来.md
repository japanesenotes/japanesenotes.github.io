## Mnemonics:
日本のものと全然違うので、私はとても外来品に興味がある。
* I’m really interested in foreign things because they’re so different from what’s in Japan.
* From <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foreign</span> lands it has <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> come</span>. How would you describe that item? Simply by calling it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> imported</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foreign</span>. This word is also used in hospitals for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> outpatient clinic</span>. That's pretty good to know if you plan on going to the hospital to get checkups in Japan.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 外, 来
* Outside, Come
