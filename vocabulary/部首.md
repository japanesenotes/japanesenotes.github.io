## Mnemonics:
私は全部の部首を覚えています。
* I remember all of the radicals.
* Picture the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> part</span> of your body that makes up your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neck</span>. Are you picturing it? That's a building block that makes up your body. A really important one. If you didn't have that neck, you wouldn't look like a person at all. Sound familiar? It should! Because that part of your neck is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> radical</span>! Just like part of your neck is a building block of your body, the radical is a building block of kanji. Get it? I sure hope so!
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [首](https://jisho.org/search/首)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />When you need a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> radical</span> to make a new kanji, you just press a button and the radical comes tumbling down the radical <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chu</span>te (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅ](https://jisho.org/search/しゅ)</span>). There's definitely no rhyme or reason to radical picking, it's just whatever pops out of the ol' chute.<br /> 
* 部, 首
* Part, Neck

* [sound:部首_g.mp3]
