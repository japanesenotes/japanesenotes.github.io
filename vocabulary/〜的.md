## Mnemonics:
Tofugu的秘密計画って一体何ですか？もう少し具体的におっしゃって頂けませんか？
* What do you mean by a Tofugu-like secret plan? Do you think you could be more specific?
* This is a strange word, I'm afraid. You'll have to bear with it. This, when added onto a word, is like adding an -al to a word (or a -like to a word). For example, add it onto <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [日本](https://jisho.org/search/日本)</span> (Japan) and you have Japanese-like, which comes out to Very Japanese. It's a weird sort of modifying word that really depends on each situation it's in, though <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> -al</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> -like</span> often do a decent job. For now, just know this word means these things. We'll start applying it to various words in the future, slowly but surely.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, probably because this is usually added onto other words, making it behave like a jukugo.
* 的
* Target
* [sound:〜的_b.mp3]
* [sound:〜的_g.mp3]
