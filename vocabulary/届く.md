## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deliver</span> so the verb vocab version here is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be delivered</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to arrive</span>. You know this one is to be delivered (aka it's just getting delivered, you aren't doing the delivery) because when this item arrives at your house you say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coo'</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [く](https://jisho.org/search/く)</span>), it arrived.
* The reading is the one you learned with the kanji: <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とど](https://jisho.org/search/とど)</span>!
* 届
* Deliver
* [sound:届く_b.mp3]
* [sound:届く_g.mp3]
