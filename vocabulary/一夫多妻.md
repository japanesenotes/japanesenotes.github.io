## Mnemonics:
全ての男性が一夫多妻制を支持する訳じゃない。
* It’s not like all men support polygamy.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> One</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> husband</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> many</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wives</span>. Sounds a bit sketchy. This is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> polygamy</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just note that the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [一](https://jisho.org/search/一)</span> gets changed to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いっ](https://jisho.org/search/いっ)</span> and the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [夫](https://jisho.org/search/夫)</span> gets changed to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぷ](https://jisho.org/search/ぷ)</span> from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふう](https://jisho.org/search/ふう)</span> for some reason. You can imagine that this is because when you are the type that has many wives, you're probably the type who makes them clean up your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> poo</span> for you as well.
* 一, 夫, 多, 妻
