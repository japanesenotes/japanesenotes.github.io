## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> solve</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be solved</span>. It can also mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be untied</span>. You know that this is the version where something just unties on its own (you're not doing the untying) because you don't have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> care</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ける](https://jisho.org/search/ける)</span>) in the world. You just watch things getting untied and don't do it yourself.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: In fact, while you're sitting there with no cares, waiting for things to become untied, you stare down at your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> toe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [と](https://jisho.org/search/と)</span>). Really imagine doing that while things around you are getting untied.
