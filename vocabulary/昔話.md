バス待合所でバスを待ちながら、昔話の絵本を子どもに読み聞かせた。
* While waiting for a bus in the bus shelter, I read a folk tale picture book for my child.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Long ago</span> people used to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> talk</span> about all sorts of things. Most of them weren't true. Long ago people liked to lie a lot. Now we call those things they talked about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> folk tale</span>s and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> legend</span>s. 
* The readings for this word are both kun'yomi readings. You learned them both already, so you should be able to read this on your own. Just watch out for the rendaku of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はなし](https://jisho.org/search/はなし)</span> to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばなし](https://jisho.org/search/ばなし)</span>.
* 昔, 話
* Long Ago, Talk
