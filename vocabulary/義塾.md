## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> righteousness</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cram school</span> is, for some reason, a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> private school</span>. Maybe because they don't think the public cram schools are any good, so they take their righteousness somewhere else to start a private one? I'm not sure.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
* 義, 塾
