* I used to be a singer when I was kid. Well, who am I kidding, I’m still a singer now.
* Remember how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [手](https://jisho.org/search/手)</span> can sometimes refer to a person? In this case, we have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> song</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> person</span> (or perhaps a person who handles songs). What is a song person also known as? A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> singer</span>.
* The readings are on'yomi readings. You've learned them both already, so you should be able to read this like a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> singer</span> sings with a bunch of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cashew</span>s <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かしゅ](https://jisho.org/search/かしゅ)</span> in their mouth. FAST AND LOUD!
