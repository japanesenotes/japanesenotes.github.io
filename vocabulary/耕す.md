## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> plow</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to plow</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to till</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to till</span> your land because you want to have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tige</span>r <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ya</span>rd (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たがや](https://jisho.org/search/たがや)</span>). That's either when you have a yard full of live tigers, or you plant bushes and shape them into tigers. I hope it's the second kind of tiger yard. Either way, you have to plow the land to get it ready.
