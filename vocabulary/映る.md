## Mnemonics:
コウイチは湖の水面に映る美しい山に感動し、ホロリと涙を流した。
* A tear rolled down Koichi’s cheek when he saw the beautiful mountains reflected on the surface of the lake.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reflect</span>. The verb vocab version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be reflected</span>. You're not doing the reflecting directly. You can remember this by thinking how rude (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span>) it is that someone's reflecting your image using a mirror for everyone outside the dressing room to see.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Your reflection is getting reflected onto the mirror. You don't like it, it doesn't look like you. Impostor reflection! You take a hammer and you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 打つ</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)つ</span>) it as hard as you can, glass flying everywhere. Then some dubstep starts playing from the broken mirror: <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)つうつうつうつ</span>. You're obviously on meth or something.
