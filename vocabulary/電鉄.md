## Mnemonics:
「はい、どうぞ。あなたが好きな阪急電鉄の写真よ。」「うわぁ！やったぁ！俺の大好きな阪急電鉄じゃん！」
* Here you are, dear. Some of those Hankyu Railway pictures you like. Oh wow, I absolutely love the Hankyu Railway!
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> electricity</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> iron</span> sounds scary, but if you think to back in the day and to where iron was used a lot, you probably think of the railway systems... big hunky pieces of iron on the ground to make the railway. So, you can advance this by adding electricity instead of coal, creating an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> electric railway</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 電, 鉄
* Electricity, Iron
