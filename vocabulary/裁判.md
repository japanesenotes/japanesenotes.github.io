## Mnemonics:

* 
* You're going to get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> judge</span>d times two. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Judge</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> judge</span> again. Once by the judge and another time by the jury. This is a whole <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> trial</span> here.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はん](https://jisho.org/search/はん)</span> goes to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばん](https://jisho.org/search/ばん)</span> though, so be careful.
* 裁, 判
* Judge, Judge
