本当に赤ん坊は私達の言葉が分からないと言い切れるんですか？もし私の双子ちゃんが、「お医者さんが今ママに、僕達がママの子宮から無事に出られるかどうかは、五分五分だって言ったみたいだね。」なんて話をしてたらどうするんですか？ああ、私の赤ちゃん、きっと先生の言葉に震え上がってるに違いないわ。
* Are you sure the baby doesn’t understand our language? What if my twins are talking right now like, The doctor told our mom that it’ll be a toss-up whether we would come out safe and sound from her uterus. Aww... Doctor, they must have been frightened by what you said.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> action</span>s around here are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nothing</span>. Absolutely nothing is going on. If nothing is going on, that means it is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> safe and sound</span> for you.
* One thing that's not safe and sound is the reading of the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [無](https://jisho.org/search/無)</span> in this word. Instead of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [む](https://jisho.org/search/む)</span> it's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶ](https://jisho.org/search/ぶ)</span>. Why? Because you thought it was safe and sound, but you were fooled. There are ghosts everywhere, all jumping out and screaming <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Boo!</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶ](https://jisho.org/search/ぶ)</span>) at you. Feel the surprise. You thought it was safe and sound!
* 無, 事
* Nothing, Action
* [sound:無事_b.mp3]
* [sound:無事_g.mp3]
