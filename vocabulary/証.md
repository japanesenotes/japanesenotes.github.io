## Mnemonics:
君の両親だって本当は叱りたくないけど、叱っているんだよ。愛の証だよ。
* Your parents tell you off, even though they don't actually want to. It's proof of their love.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: Someone left some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> evidence</span> behind at the crime scene. You pick it up, it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a kashi</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あかし](https://jisho.org/search/あかし)</span>) bar. It has genetic evidence on it, because the criminal was eating it at the crime scene.
* 証
* Evidence
