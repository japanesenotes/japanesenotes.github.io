## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suspend</span>, but in this case, you're going to suspend your win or loss and try <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to stake</span> it all on one, big bet. You're going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to risk</span> it all!
* You decide <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to risk</span> it all and bet everything on your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>). If you lose, you lose the car, but if you win, then you were right to stake it all on this.
