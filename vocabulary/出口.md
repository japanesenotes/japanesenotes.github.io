## Mnemonics:
このきゅうじょうの出口はあちらです。
* This baseball stadium’s exit is over there.
* The mouth you exit out of is just a doorway (I hope), but an easier way to describe this word or concept is to call it an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exit</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [出口]([出](https://jisho.org/search/出)口)</span> is an exception to this rule, however, and uses its kun'yomi readings. There's no particular reason why this is, but oftentimes a body part word (like mouth) changes a word to use kun'yomi readings instead of on'yomi ones. You already know the kun'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [口](https://jisho.org/search/口)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くち](https://jisho.org/search/くち)</span>) from learning the vocab, but to remember the reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [出](https://jisho.org/search/出)</span> you can think the following:<br />If I exit out this mouth, I'll end up in the ocean (you were swallowed by a whale) and I will surely end up <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dea</span>d (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [で](https://jisho.org/search/で)</span>).<br />Also keep in mind that because of rendaku, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くち](https://jisho.org/search/くち)</span> becomes <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぐち](https://jisho.org/search/ぐち)</span>.
* 出, 口
* Exit, Mouth
* [sound:出口_b.mp3]
* [sound:出口_g.mp3]
