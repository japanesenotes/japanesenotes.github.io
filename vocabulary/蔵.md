## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* The reading is the same as the other storehouse reading (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [倉](https://jisho.org/search/倉)</span>) you learned earlier. They're both basically the same thing, and lucky for you they share the same reading too (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> くら</span>).
