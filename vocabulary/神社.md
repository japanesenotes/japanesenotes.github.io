よぉ、中々イケてる自撮りじゃん。でも、お前、なんで学校じゃなくて神社になんていたんだよ？
* Yo! Very cool selfie, but why were you in a shinto shrine instead of at school?
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> God</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> company</span>... think of this as what 'company' does the god's work? Well, the answer to that is a shrine, probably. In this case a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shinto Shrine</span> because of the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しん](https://jisho.org/search/しん)</span> in the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [神](https://jisho.org/search/神)</span>.
* But wait! <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [神](https://jisho.org/search/神)</span> is read <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じん](https://jisho.org/search/じん)</span> in this word for some reason. Darn them gods, always messing around, adding dakuten. Maybe this will help, though: Imagine yourself at a Shinto Shrine. You are praying to the Gods, asking for food. Out from the sky rains <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ginger</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じん](https://jisho.org/search/じん)じゃ</span>). You are pelted with it and not sure if you should be happy or upset.
* 神, 社
* God, Company
