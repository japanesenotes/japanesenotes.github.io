## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> government</span> behind a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> curtain</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bakufu</span>. They didn't let anyone know their government secrets so they would hide behind that curtain and keep everything to themselves.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [幕](https://jisho.org/search/幕)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />If you try to peek through the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bakufu</span>'s curtain you'll only see someone's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> back</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばく](https://jisho.org/search/ばく)</span>). They all huddle together to discuss things so a row of hunched backs is all you'll get out of the shogunate. That's not helpful.
* 幕, 府
* Curtain, Government
