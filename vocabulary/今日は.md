## Mnemonics:
大きなこえで、「今日は」といいましょう。
* Let’s shout, hello.
* This is a strange one. It's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こんにちは](https://jisho.org/search/こんにちは)</span>, which you've probably heard before, but it's spelled using the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> now</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> day</span>. So when you say now day! you're really saying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hello</span>!<br />Warning! Don't mix this up with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょうは](https://jisho.org/search/きょうは)</span>! While they may look the same, they don't mean the same thing. We will only ever ask you for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こんにちは](https://jisho.org/search/こんにちは)</span>, so please try to remember that!<br />We usually don't use kanji for this, so don't use it when you're writing. But you'll probably run into it in the wild so it's good to know!
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own. Just be aware that the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span> at the end is actually the particle <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span> so it's pronounced like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わ](https://jisho.org/search/わ)</span>.
* 今, 日
* Now, Sun
* [sound:今日は_b.mp3]
* [sound:今日は_g.mp3]
