## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> escape</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to escape</span>. Also, it can be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to flee</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to run away</span>. Basically, if you're trying to get away from someone or something, you could be doing this.
* You are trying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to escape</span> from something chasing you, but you can't run fast because of your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> knee</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [に](https://jisho.org/search/に)</span>). You try to run, but it keeps holding you back. Feel the fear and pain of running with a hurt knee, and curse that knee of yours for holding you back.
