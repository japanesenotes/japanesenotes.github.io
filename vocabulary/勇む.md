## Mnemonics:
少年は、喜び勇んで旅に出発した。
* The boy left for his trip in high spirits.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> courage</span> so the verb version is what happens when you have lots of it. Someone with courage is probably the kind of person <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be lively</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be encouraged</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Who is the one person who always seems <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be encouraged</span> and excited? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Isa</span>bel (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いさ](https://jisho.org/search/いさ)</span>)! She's so positive and always cheers everyone, including herself, up.
