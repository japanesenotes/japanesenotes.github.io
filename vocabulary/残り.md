## Mnemonics:
今夜はデートがあるので、晩御飯は昼御飯の残りを温めて食べてね。ママより。
* I’m going on a date tonight. You can heat up some leftovers from lunch to eat for dinner. Love, Mom.
* This has the same meaning as the kanji. The little <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [り](https://jisho.org/search/り)</span> thrown on there is just a little <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> remainder</span> sticking off the end of the kanji. No need to pay attention to that.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: You're waiting inside. The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> remainder</span> of your forces are out there, fighting. You don't know who will survive... or if they even will. You have a secret <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> knock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [のこ](https://jisho.org/search/のこ)</span>), though, that you use to find out if it's one of the remaining forces outside or the enemy, broken through. You hear a knock. What is it? Is it your men or theirs? Imagine it out, focusing on the knock conversation that happens between you and the remainder.
