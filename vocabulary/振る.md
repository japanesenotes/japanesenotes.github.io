## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shake</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to shake</span>. It's also used for when you shake things your hand, aka <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to wave</span>.<br />This word can also be used when you shake someone off in the less physical way. It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to dump</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to break up with</span> them.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: The building starts <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to shake</span>. The most unfortunate thing here is that you're totally <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> full</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふる](https://jisho.org/search/ふる)</span>), and you throw up because of the shaking (and you're full, gross!).
* 振
* Shake
