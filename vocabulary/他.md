## Mnemonics:
この卵をあいつの家に投げるのは、他の日にしようぜ。
* Let’s throw these eggs at his house some other day.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* <div>OTHER PERSON = HOCKER = HOKA</div><div><br></div>Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br>You need to go for a drive to the public gardens, but you aren't going to get your normal car, you're going to get your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> other</span> car. Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hoe car</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほか](https://jisho.org/search/ほか)</span>)! It's a car made entirely out of garden hoes. You can drive it and hoe with it at the same time! Your other car can't do that!
