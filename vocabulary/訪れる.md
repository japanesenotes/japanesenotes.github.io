## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> visit</span> and the verb vocab version is also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to visit</span>. What makes it different from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [訪ねる](https://jisho.org/search/訪ねる)</span>, though? With <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [訪れる](https://jisho.org/search/訪れる)</span>, you tend to be doing something for fun but with a purpose. So, if you were visiting Tokyo for sightseeing, you could say <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [訪れる](https://jisho.org/search/訪れる)</span>. If you were going to visit Tokyo for no real reason, you could say <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [訪ねる](https://jisho.org/search/訪ねる)</span>. That being said, they are almost exactly the same, just the nuance is different.
* The reading isn't the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [訪ねる](https://jisho.org/search/訪ねる)</span>, though, I'm afraid. It's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おとず](https://jisho.org/search/おとず)</span>, so think how this verb is the one where you do have a (fun) purpose to visit wherever you're visiting. That being said, you forgot what you were visiting as well. When you finally remember, it's because you were looking down to think. It's to look at the toes of the giant Buddha statue. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Oh Toes</span>! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おとず](https://jisho.org/search/おとず)</span>) you exclaim.
