Facebookでお金を稼ぐ方法を発見したぜ。しかも超簡単なの。まず、アカウント設定に行くだろ、それからアカウントを停止して、仕事に行くんだ！
* I discovered how to make money from Facebook. It’s easy. Just go to your account settings, deactivate your account, and go to work.
* You make <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> departure</span> from your home off into the great beyond. You will go to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> see</span> the unseen, and hopefully make a great <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> discovery</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. You know the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はつ](https://jisho.org/search/はつ)</span> part, which gets shortened to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はっ](https://jisho.org/search/はっ)</span>. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [見](https://jisho.org/search/見)</span> is unlike what you learned with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [見](https://jisho.org/search/見)</span>, though. <br />In order to remember that this is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> けん</span>, imagine you're going out to make a discovery of some strange new lands. With strange new lands, there comes strange new people. This one has a samurai named <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ken</span> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けん](https://jisho.org/search/けん)</span> on it. He's trying to discover new things too!
* 発, 見
* Departure, See
