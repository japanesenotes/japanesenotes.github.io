## Mnemonics:
「ごめん。てっきり君が僕の自転車を壊したのかと思ってたよ。」 「何それ！ひどい。私がそんなことするはずないでしょ。」
* I’m sorry. I thought for sure you were the one who broke my bike. What? That’s awful. You know me better than that.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> self</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> revolving</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> car</span>. You'd think this would be a regular car, but <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bicycles</span> were probably introduced before cars were, meaning the self revolving car is the bicycle, not the car. Just imagine yourself on a bike, and you don't even have to move the pedals. They revolve themselves, but now you're going too fast and it's scary.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 自, 転, 車
* Self, Revolve, Car
* [sound:自転車_b.mp3]
* [sound:自転車_g.mp3]
