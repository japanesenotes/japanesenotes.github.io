## Mnemonics:

* 
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mosquito</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> notebook</span>, for some reason, is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mosquito net</span>. Think of a notebook with graph paper lines on it, perhaps. These lines are shaped like a net. Surround yourself with it to make your own <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mosquito net</span>.
* The first kanji, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [蚊](https://jisho.org/search/蚊)</span>, uses the reading you learned. The second kanji has an exceptional reading, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [や](https://jisho.org/search/や)</span>. To remember <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [や](https://jisho.org/search/や)</span>, think about how you had to take a giant <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mosquito net</span> and cover all of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ya</span>nkee (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [や](https://jisho.org/search/や)</span>) Stadium. They have a rough mosquito problem.
