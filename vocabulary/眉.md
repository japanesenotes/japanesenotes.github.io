## Mnemonics:
眉の動きに注目すると表情を捉えやすいって知ってましたか？
* Did you know paying attention to how eyebrows move makes it easier to perceive facial expressions?
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. This also includes the place where your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eyebrows</span> live: your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> brow</span>.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You're staring lovingly at your own <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eyebrows</span> in the mirror when your mom walks in and you gasp, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ma! You</span>... (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まゆ](https://jisho.org/search/まゆ)</span>) but you're in so much shock you can't finish the sentence, Ma, you shaved off your eyebrows?!
* 眉
* Eyebrows
* [sound:眉_b.mp3]
* [sound:眉_g.mp3]
