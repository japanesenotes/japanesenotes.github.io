## Mnemonics:
お父さんのねこはかわいい。
* My dad’s cat is adorable.
* This word begins with an honorific (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)</span>) making whatever comes after it more elevated. Then there's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [父](https://jisho.org/search/父)</span>, which you know means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> father</span>. Lastly, we have the honorific (things you put on people's names in Japanese) <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さん](https://jisho.org/search/さん)</span>. This is a nice way to say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> father</span>. You use it when you're talking to your own <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dad</span> or talking about him with friends. You can also use this when you're talking about your friends' dads.<br />If you need to talk about someone's father that you don't really know, or you aren't close to, you'll want to use <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)父様</span>, instead. Don't worry, you'll learn that last kanji in a few lessons. Until then, it's pronounced, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)とうさま</span>. Kay?
* The part you have to learn to read is the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [父](https://jisho.org/search/父)</span> portion. This uses the kun'yomi, which you didn't learn when doing the kanji. <br />Imagine your venerable <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> father</span> standing in front of you. Except, instead of being a human, he is a giant <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> toe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とう](https://jisho.org/search/とう)</span>). Imagine him talking to you, giving you high fives, whatever. Just make it as ridiculous as possible while you're saying Yes father. Yes father. Whatever you say, father.
* 父
* Father
