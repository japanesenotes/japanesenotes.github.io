この書類の漢字全部に、振り仮名を振ってもらえませんか？
* Could you add kana to all the kanji in this document, please?
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> temporary</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> name</span>s. These are the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kana</span> (that's hiragana and katakana). Why are the temporary names kana, though? Perhaps they were never meant to be a main way to write the names of the kanji... They are just a temporary way to write the name of kanji you don't know how to write the correct way (aka kanji)? That's just a guess, but it should help you to remember that this word means kana, at least.
* The reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [仮](https://jisho.org/search/仮)</span> is the one you learned with the kanji. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [名](https://jisho.org/search/名)</span> portion is not, however, and uses its kun'yomi reading (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [な](https://jisho.org/search/な)</span>), which you saw with the kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [名](https://jisho.org/search/名)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [な](https://jisho.org/search/な)</span>). How to remember all this, though? Think of it this way: <br />The people who made kanji really don't want you to know <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kana</span>. It's bad for business. They want anyone who uses the word kana to suffer, so they decided to make one part on'yomi and another part kun'yomi. Don't let them get you!
