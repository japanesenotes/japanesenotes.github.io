## Mnemonics:
「今夜は、どこで食事したい？」「あなたが決めてよ。私はじゃんけんに負けたんだから。」
* Where do you want to eat tonight? It’s your call. I lost the rock-paper-scissors.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lose</span> so the verb vocab version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to lose</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You lose your tournament/soccer game/whatever (you decide something applicable to you). You're sad about this. Who's there to comfort you? Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ma</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ま](https://jisho.org/search/ま)</span>). She's a nice lady.
