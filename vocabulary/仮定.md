彼女のベッドに積まれた札束のせいで、今とんでもない仮定が俺の頭の中を飛び交っている。
* Since seeing that pile of money on her bed, crazy assumptions have been flying around in my head.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> temporary</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> determin</span>ation is something you're not totally sure about. You've decided to think of something in a certain way, but only for now. If more information comes to light, you may change. That's why this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> assumption</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hypothesis</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 仮, 定
* Temporary, Determine
