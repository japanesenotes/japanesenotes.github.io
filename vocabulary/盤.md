## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are the same! This word also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> board</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> disc</span>, which makes sense if you think about it. Boards you play games on are basically just trays for the pieces, and discs go inside boards (like records) for storage.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji!
* 盤
* Tray
* [sound:盤_b.mp3]
* [sound:盤_g.mp3]
