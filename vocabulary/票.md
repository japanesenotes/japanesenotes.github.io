## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. It can also be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a vote</span>, because that's what ballots tend to do.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
* 票
* Ballot
* [sound:票_b.mp3]
