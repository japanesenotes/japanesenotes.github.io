## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [編む](https://jisho.org/search/編む)</span> is to knit. When you knit in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> three</span>s, you are knitting in a braid style. What do you braid? Hair. That makes this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> braided hair</span>.
* The reading is the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [み](https://jisho.org/search/み)</span> from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [三つ](https://jisho.org/search/三つ)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [編む](https://jisho.org/search/編む)</span> combined into one (or should I say three?) braids. Just watch out because this isn't <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [み](https://jisho.org/search/み)っつあみ</span>, it's just <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [み](https://jisho.org/search/み)つあみ</span>. Listen to the audio a few times to make sure you remember how it's spelled and pronounced!
* 三, 編
* Three, Knit
