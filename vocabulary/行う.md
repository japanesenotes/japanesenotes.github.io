## Mnemonics:
東京病院に豚の心臓を運ぶ仕事を任されましたが、もし私がその仕事を行わなければ、誰かが料理を完成させることができなくなってしまいます。
* I’ve been entrusted with the job of delivering a pig heart to Tokyo hospital and if I don’t carry out my task someone won’t be able to finish the meal they’re cooking.
* The meaning of this word is pretty strange, having very little to do with the kanji meaning you learned. This word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to carry out a task</span>. Maybe you can think of it like someone is saying You (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span>) <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> go</span> do that task! to get yourself <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to carry out a task</span>. Whatever you do, just know this is a weird exception word, so you may have to do some extra work to remember it.
* The reading is also a strange exception. You have to remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おこな](https://jisho.org/search/おこな)</span> portion. Think of it this way: You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to carry out a task</span> but you have to wait for the go-ahead to start. Then, your boss tells you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Okay now!</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おこな](https://jisho.org/search/おこな)</span>) and you can begin. <br />The reading mnemonic isn't totally close to the actual reading, though, so be sure to make note in your mind that this mnemonic is only supposed to get you part of the way there. You'll have to get yourself the rest of the way for this one.
* 行
* Go
* [sound:行う_b.mp3]
* [sound:行う_g.mp3]
