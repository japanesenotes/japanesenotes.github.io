## Mnemonics:
性病を移してくれてどうも有難う。とても嬉しいです。
* Thank you very much for giving me an STD. It means a lot to me.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gender</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sick</span>ness is one you catch from *ahem* doing things with those of another or the same gender. You only catch these sicknesses this way, meaning they're sexually transmitted diseases (save yourself some typing and just answer with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> STD</span>).
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 性, 病
* Gender, Sick
* [sound:性病_b.mp3]
