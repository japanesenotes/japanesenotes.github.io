## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> consolation</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to console</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: I'm going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to console</span> you for what happened to you. The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nag saw</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なぐさ](https://jisho.org/search/なぐさ)</span>) was turned on and buzzed through your leg. What a nagging feeling. You need some consoling.
