## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scorn</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to scorn</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to despise</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You start <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to scorn</span> your boss because she's been wearing that same <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sage su</span>it (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さげす](https://jisho.org/search/さげす)</span>) for a month now. She knows you want to wear a sage suit too but you can't wear the same color as her! It's really making you start to despise her. Uhg!
