## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> publish</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be published</span>. Books can be published, magazines can be published, and I guess even your gross blog posts get published too.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Hey, were you able <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be published</span> yet? someone asks, and the answer is always <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> NO</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [の](https://jisho.org/search/の)</span>)! It's never your time to get published. The answer is always no... because no one likes (sniff) what you write (sob).
