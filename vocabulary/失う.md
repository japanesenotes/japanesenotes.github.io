## Mnemonics:
人生最悪の日は、私がAKB48のフィギュアを失った日です。
* The worst day of my life was when I lost my AKB48 Barbie doll.
* The kanji portion means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fault</span>, so you would think the verb version is to fault. It's a little different, though. Think of it this way, if you fault something, you're messing up. What's a great way to mess up? By losing something. That's why this word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to lose</span>. <br />Pretend like you are supposed to hold on to someone's wedding ring. You make the biggest fault of all. You lose it. Ouch.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />How did you lose this wedding ring? An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [牛](https://jisho.org/search/牛)</span> Nu</span>n (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うし](https://jisho.org/search/うし)</span> + <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [な](https://jisho.org/search/な)</span>) ate it. The only way to get it back is to cut open this cow nun and get it back.
