* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Distract</span> me with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> twist</span> in what we're doing. Just imagine you're working on something. Then, you get distracted by a twist in whatever it is that you're working on. This little twist doesn't destroy everything, but it does cause a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> complication</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> confusion</span>.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
