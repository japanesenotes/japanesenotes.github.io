## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> view</span> so what is the verb vocab version? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to view</span>. This is mainly used for spectators who are viewing something.
* The reading here is actually the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [見る]([見](https://jisho.org/search/見)る)</span>. This is easy to remember because the meanings are so similar too, not to mention it has a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [見](https://jisho.org/search/見)</span> right inside the kanji itself!
