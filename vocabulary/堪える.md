## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> endure</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to endure</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to bear</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You're at your friend's house and you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to bear</span> with what they made for dinner. It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ta</span>cos (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [た](https://jisho.org/search/た)</span>). Normally you can't stand tacos but tonight you'll have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to endure</span>. It's rude to refuse food when you're a guest. But tacos are so gross!
