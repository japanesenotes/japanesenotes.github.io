## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Can also refer to a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shogi piece</span> too, since that's Japanese chess, after all.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
* 駒
* Chess Piece
* [sound:駒_b.mp3]
* [sound:駒_g.mp3]
