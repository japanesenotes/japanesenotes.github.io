## Mnemonics:
コウイチが履いてるパンツは、子供向けなんじゃないのか？ツンツルテンだよ。
* Aren’t the underpants Koichi is wearing for children? He’s outgrown his clothes.
* You've hopefully seen <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [向く](https://jisho.org/search/向く)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [向ける]([向け](https://jisho.org/search/向け)る)</span> by now. They mean to face and to turn toward. This has a similar idea. When you add <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [向け](https://jisho.org/search/向け)</span> to something imagine you're turning it, aiming it at someone. It's aimed at them, meaning it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> made for</span> them. Turn a book toward someone, now it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> aimed at</span> them, it's made for them. See the connection?
* The reading is the same as the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [向く](https://jisho.org/search/向く)</span> so work off of that word to be able to read this one.
* 向
* Yonder
* [sound:〜向け_b.mp3]
