## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* To remember the reading think about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thunder</span>. Back in the day, it was probably terrifying. It probably came from the gods! So, what if you got hit with this electricity? Would you become a god too? Let's pretend that's true, and let's pretend that's why <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [雷](https://jisho.org/search/雷)</span> is read like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 神成り</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かみなり](https://jisho.org/search/かみなり)</span>) which means to become a god!
