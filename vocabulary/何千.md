* Victims of the titan attack numbered in the thousands.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> What</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thousand</span>? Could be five thousand, two thousand, or ten thousand, since you're asking. Let's generalize. How do you say all of those amounts at the same time? You say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thousands</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just take note that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [千](https://jisho.org/search/千)</span> is read as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぜん](https://jisho.org/search/ぜん)</span> and not <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span> because of rendaku.
