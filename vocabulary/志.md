## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* This is a long reading, but I think it has some sense to it. Think about how when you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> intention</span> to do something, you have a feeling of being stabbed in the heart (with intention, of course). To say that in Japanese, you could go <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こころざし](https://jisho.org/search/こころざし)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [心刺し](https://jisho.org/search/心刺し)</span>). Guess what? The reading is the same thing as that, bringing it to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こころざし</span>.
* 志
* Intention
* [sound:志_b.mp3]
