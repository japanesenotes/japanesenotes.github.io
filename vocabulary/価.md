## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: Okay, this is a great <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> value</span>. Wait, what is? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> A tie</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あたい](https://jisho.org/search/あたい)</span>). Get a tie, and it will make you more professional which will help you to get a better job. Great value, right there, just for a tie.
