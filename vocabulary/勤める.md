## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> work</span> which means this verb has something to do with working. It's not straight up to work, instead it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to work for</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be employed at</span>.
* The reading is the same as the other word that means to work for (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [務める](https://jisho.org/search/務める)</span>). Remember this and you'll be able to remember the reading for this word too.
