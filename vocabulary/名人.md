## Mnemonics:
彼はチェスの名人であるだけでなく、トランプの名人でもある。
* Not only is he an expert at chess, he’s also a master at cards.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> person</span> whose <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> name</span> is known (because he's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> famous</span>?). Why is this person's name known? Why is this person famous? It's because they are a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> master</span> / <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> expert</span> at something. How else does someone become famous or well-known? That's pretty much it, even if they're just an expert at being an idiot.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 名, 人
* Name, Person
