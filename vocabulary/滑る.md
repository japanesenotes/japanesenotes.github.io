* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> slippery</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to slide</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to slip</span>.
* It wouldn't be so slippery in here if your friend Beth hadn't spilled something all over the floor. This is the third time you've slipped this month! You know what you have to do. You have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue Be</span>th (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すべ](https://jisho.org/search/すべ)</span>)! She'll pay for making you slip and slide!
