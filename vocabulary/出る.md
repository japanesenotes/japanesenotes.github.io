## Mnemonics:
わたしは、パチンコやからいそいで出た。
* I made a hasty exit from that pachinko parlor.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means exit so what is the verb form of this? It is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to exit</span>.<br />Don't get this word confused with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [出す](https://jisho.org/search/出す)</span>, though, which means to hand over or to take something out. You can remember that this word means to exit because it ends with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span> which sounds like the beginning of the word room. What do you do with a room? You exit it.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You want to exit the room you're in. Why? Because it has a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> de</span>ad (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [で](https://jisho.org/search/で)</span>) body in it. Seriously. You should exit now.
* 出
* Exit
