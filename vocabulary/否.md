## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />Instead of saying no you say na, and instead of saying na you say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いな](https://jisho.org/search/いな)</span></span>. It's also commonly used for just about every way to say no like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いいえ](https://jisho.org/search/いいえ)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いや](https://jisho.org/search/いや)</span>, so as long as you know how to say no, you know this reading!
* 否
* No
