## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> measure</span> so the verb vocab means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to measure</span>. This word generally has to do with scientific or medical measurements.
* Remember another word that means to measure? It is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [量る](https://jisho.org/search/量る)</span>, and has the same reading as this word. That should make things easier to remember.
* 測
* Measure
