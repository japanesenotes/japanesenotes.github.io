## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />The worst thing to see as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> captive</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 鳥子</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とりこ](https://jisho.org/search/とりこ)</span>), a bird child. Imagine seeing a baby bird held captive in a cage. So sad!
