## Mnemonics:

* 
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bury</span> things into people who look like they've <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> die</span>d. It's called <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> implantation</span>. They're not really dead though. This is surgery and they'll wake up and go about their lives with whatever that thing was that you put in them.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [埋](https://jisho.org/search/埋)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />Wait that's not a person you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> embedding</span> things into. It's a bunch of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mi</span>ce (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まい](https://jisho.org/search/まい)</span>). I guess that's okay. Just don't go putting the mice into people. That's... don't cross that line.
* 埋, 没
* Bury, Die
