## Mnemonics:
彼は素敵な人だと思うかもしれないが、根がひどい男なのだ。
* You might think he’s a great person but he’s really a horrible man at heart.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> root</span> you have is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ne</span>-root, used to perform necromancy (it's why it's called a ne-root). Grind it up and use it on some dead bodies to bring them back to life (in your imagination, of course).
* 根
* Root
* [sound:根_b.mp3]
* [sound:根_g.mp3]
