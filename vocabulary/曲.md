## Mnemonics:
彼がピアノで一曲弾いてくれたんですが、何故かそのピアノはギターの様な音がしたんです。
* He played a tune for us on the piano, but for some reason, the piano sounded like a guitar.
* This almost shares the meaning with the kanji. It's essentially the same thing, though when it's alone it refers to a specific <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> piece of music</span> (aka a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tune</span>).
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji as well, so you should be able to read it.
* 曲
* Music
* [sound:曲_b.mp3]
* [sound:曲_g.mp3]
