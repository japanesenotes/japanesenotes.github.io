## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to illuminate</span>. Don't get it confused with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [照れる](https://jisho.org/search/照れる)</span> which is to feel embarrassed, though, that would be embarrassing. You know this is to illuminate because the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [らす](https://jisho.org/search/らす)</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rash</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [らす](https://jisho.org/search/らす)</span>) you get every time you're illuminated.
* Speaking of things that illuminate, your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hand</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [手](https://jisho.org/search/手)</span>) illuminate all the time for some reason.
