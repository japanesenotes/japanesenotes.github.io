## Mnemonics:
この種をどこに植えるつもりだい。
* Where do you plan on planting that seed?
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> plant</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to plant</span>.
* You haven't learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [植](https://jisho.org/search/植)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You decided <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to plant</span> an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> u</span>ni (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span>) tree in your backyard. That's right, you can plant uni and they'll grow like fruit off a really spiky tree. Just picture it. And then you'll get to eat all the uni you want!
