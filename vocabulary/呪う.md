## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> curse</span>, and the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to curse</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to put a curse on</span>.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
* 呪
* Curse
* [sound:呪う_b.mp3]
* [sound:呪う_g.mp3]
