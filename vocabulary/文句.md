## Mnemonics:
日本語で、文句という言葉が、英語の僧侶という単語と発音が似ているということは面白いですね。
* It’s funny that the Japanese word for complaint is pronounced like the English word monk.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> paragraph</span> in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> writing</span> is what you send someone when you want to submit a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> complaint</span>. You want to make sure these are in writing, though, otherwise you don't have proof of your complaint. Also, don't make it longer than a paragraph, because that's too long and nobody cares about how you think the shop staff mistreated your dog Fluffy.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 文, 句
