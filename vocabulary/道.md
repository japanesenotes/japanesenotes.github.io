## Mnemonics:
この道を車で20分ぐらい行けば、未確認動物ビッグフットが目撃された場所に辿り着くよ。
* Drive down this road for about twenty minutes and you’ll come to the place where an unidentified creature was spotted.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. <br />Don't confuse this with the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [〜道]([〜](https://jisho.org/search/〜)道)</span>, though. This one doesn't have a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [〜](https://jisho.org/search/〜)</span> at the beginning, meaning it's not attached to other words. This word is just plain old road. It has its own meaning!
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: <br />You're walking down the road. On the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> road</span>, you bump into your friend, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Mitch</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みち](https://jisho.org/search/みち)</span>). Imagine saying hello, then continuing down the road. What's weird is you're both walking down a paved road with cars on it. Seems dangerous, but you and Mitch, you know what you're doing. <br />If you don't know anyone named Mitch, think of a famous Mitch or a Mitch you've made up.
