## Mnemonics:

* 
* When your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> laziness</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> loose</span> you can't pull yourself together and you end up moving really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> slow</span>. Your arms and legs get loose and you movements become <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sluggish</span>.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [緩](https://jisho.org/search/緩)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You've become so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> slow</span> that you can only eat things out of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> can</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>). You don't have the energy to cook and your arms are all loose so it doesn't even matter if you weren't moving so slowly. So just lay there, eating slowly from a can.
