## Mnemonics:
波にゆらゆら揺られるのが気持ちいい。
* The rocking of the waves to and fro feels good.
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: You jump on a wave and ride around the world on it. It doesn't drop you off anywhere, until you reach a certain location: Viet<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nam</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なみ](https://jisho.org/search/なみ)</span>). You jump off the wave and look at Vietnam. Imagine the most Vietnamese things you can think of to help you to make this wave-Vietnam association.
