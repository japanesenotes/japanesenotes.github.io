## Mnemonics:
彼の言ったことを大袈裟に考えないで。難病で苦しんでるなんて明らかに嘘なんだから。
* Don’t make a big deal out of what he said. It’s definitely a lie that he’s suffering from an incurable disease.
* As you can probably imagine, when you add the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sick</span> to another word, you're saying what kind of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sickness</span> it is; you are mentioning what <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> disease</span> it is.
* Since this is attached to other words, it's treated like jukugo and gets on'yomi treatment. This is the reading you learned with the kanji.
* 病
* Sick
* [sound:〜病_b.mp3]
* [sound:〜病_g.mp3]
