ビジネス街にオフィスを設けるとなると賃料はかなり高くつきますが、我々のイメージにとって重要な事でもありますし、一年ぐらいで元は取れるのではないかと思うんです。
* Renting an office in the business district will be considerably expensive, but it’s important for our image and I think it will pay for itself in about a year.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb.<br />This is an intransitive verb. That means it does not take a direct object. Something comes off. Something is removed. No direct object here. That's why this verb means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to come off</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be removed</span>.
* Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading.<br />Lucky for you, the kanji readings for transitive and intransitive verbs are almost always the same. Once you learn one, you know them both! This reading is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [取る](https://jisho.org/search/取る)</span>.
* 取
* Take
* [sound:取れる_b.mp3]
* [sound:取れる_g.mp3]
