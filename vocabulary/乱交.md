## Mnemonics:
「何か今日の俺、マジでイケてる。ひょっとしたらアイツらの乱交パーティにも誘われちゃうかも。」「ははは〜。そうだといいね。」
* I look so good today, I may be asked to join an orgy. Haha. You wish!
* A big <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mix</span> of folks forming a kind of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> riot</span>. You'd think this would be something more violent, but it's really just an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> orgy</span>. Lots of mixing, I guess, and not very much organization on the orgy-organizer's part, at least according to this kanji sequence.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 乱, 交
* Riot, Mix
* [sound:乱交_b.mp3]
