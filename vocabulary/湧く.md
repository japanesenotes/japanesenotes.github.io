## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> well</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to well up</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You're fishing in a hole in the ice when suddenly the water starts <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to well up</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to gush forth</span> out of it. A huge <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wa</span>lrus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わ](https://jisho.org/search/わ)</span>) splashes out and jumps on you. No wonder there weren't any fish! This is a walrus hole.
