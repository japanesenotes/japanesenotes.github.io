* When you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> obtain</span> something you need to keep it safe, so you decide <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to store</span> it somewhere. Then you can always go back and look at the thing you managed <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to achieve</span> and no one can take it from you.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to store</span> all of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> o</span>ld <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> saw</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おさ](https://jisho.org/search/おさ)</span>). You were able <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to finish</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to achieve</span> everything you wanted with them, so it's time to put them away so they'll be safe.
