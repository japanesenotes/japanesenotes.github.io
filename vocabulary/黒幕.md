## Mnemonics:

* 
* Just imagine a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> black</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> curtain</span> off in the background. You don't know what's behind it, but you know what's in front of it. Thing is, the thing in front of the curtain is controlled by whoever is behind the black curtain. This person is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wirepuller</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mastermind</span> of the situation. Like the Wizard of Oz, or something.
* The reading is the vocab readings for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [黒](https://jisho.org/search/黒)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [幕](https://jisho.org/search/幕)</span>, though the vocab reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [幕](https://jisho.org/search/幕)</span> is the same as the on'yomi reading, making things easy for you.
