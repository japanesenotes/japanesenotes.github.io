## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />When something leaves <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> traces</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mark</span>s behind, it's because they were there, but now they're gone, and you've come <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 後</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あと](https://jisho.org/search/あと)</span>) they left.
