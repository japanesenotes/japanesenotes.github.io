## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> polish</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to polish</span> or, strangely specifically (and we'll learn an even more specific word for this later) <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to brush your teeth</span>.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
* 磨
* Polish
* [sound:磨く_b.mp3]
* [sound:磨く_g.mp3]
