## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: Please hand me the rope, right <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> now</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なわ](https://jisho.org/search/なわ)</span>), otherwise I will fall to my death!
* 縄
* Rope
* [sound:縄_b.mp3]
