## Mnemonics:

* 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Pickle</span>d <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thing</span>s are Japanese pickled vegetables! Or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tsukemono</span> if you've already been eating yummy pickled ginger, daikon, and umeboshi!
* You already learned <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [漬ける](https://jisho.org/search/漬ける)</span> meaning to pickle so just take the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span> off there shove the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [け](https://jisho.org/search/け)</span> into the kanji. You read it still, but it's hiding. It probably shrunk in the pickling process. Stick some things (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もの](https://jisho.org/search/もの)</span>) on there are you know the reading! Not bad! By the way, sometimes you'll see this word spelled like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [漬け物](https://jisho.org/search/漬け物)</span> too.
* 漬, 物
