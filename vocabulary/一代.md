## Mnemonics:
彼は一代で巨額の財産を作ったが、彼の息子がさらにそれを二倍にした。
* He amassed an enormous fortune over the course of his lifetime and his son doubled it.
* This word has the kanji for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> one</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> period</span>. You only have one period to live in so this is the only <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lifetime</span> you get. Unless you're reborn, but that will probably be in the next age, not this one. So one lifetime for you!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 一, 代
* One, Substitute
* [sound:一代_b.mp3]
