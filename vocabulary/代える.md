## Mnemonics:
この指輪をお金に代えることはできません。
* I can’t exchange this ring for money.
* You know the kanji is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> substitute</span>, and you know this is a verb. There are other similar ones, but this one means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to replace</span>. In order to remember that this particular word means to replace focus in on the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [え](https://jisho.org/search/え)</span>. You have an egg in your hands that you notice isn't any good (it's black and moldy). So, you replace it with another egg (or substitute it with another egg, or exchange it with another egg, etc).
* The reading for this one is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [代わる](https://jisho.org/search/代わる)</span> which you learned in a previous level. As long as you know that one you should be able to learn this one's reading as well.
