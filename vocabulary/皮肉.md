## Mnemonics:
「Ironic」という曲の中に、うまい皮肉はひとつも見当たらなかった。
* Not one thing in the song Ironic is a proper example of irony.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> skin</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> meat</span> is kind of like the outer shell. It's not very nice, and people who eat only meat skin tend to use <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sarcasm</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> irony</span>. That being said, Japanese people don't really understand sarcasm. So, maybe that's why meat skin means sarcasm. Is this ironic? Now I'm not even sure.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.
* 皮, 肉
* Skin, Meat
* [sound:皮肉_b.mp3]
* [sound:皮肉_g.mp3]
