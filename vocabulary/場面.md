## Mnemonics:
最後の場面で泣いてしまいました。
* I cried during the last scene.
* Everything on a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> location</span>'s <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> surface</span> is really just a part of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scene</span> before you. This is the kind of scene that would be set in a novel. It's the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> setting</span>.
* The reading is a combination of kun'yomi and on'yomi readings. That being said, both readings for both kanji are the readings you learned already, so you should be able to read this.
* 場, 面
* Location, Face
