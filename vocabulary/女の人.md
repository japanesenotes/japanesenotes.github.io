## Mnemonics:
女の人としゃべるのが苦手です。
* I’m not good at talking to women.
* The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [の](https://jisho.org/search/の)</span> particle makes it so the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [人](https://jisho.org/search/人)</span> belongs to the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [女](https://jisho.org/search/女)</span>. Basically, this literally means a woman person or a person of woman. It's a more polite way to say plain old woman, though, so all you have to remember is that.
* This word is actually two separate words combined with a particle. So, since you treat them like separate words, you read each of them with the kun'yomi readings (they are both single kanji words all alone). That being said, in level 1 you learned about the vocab readings for these separate words, so use that knowledge to remember the reading for this word as well.
* 女, 人
* Woman, Person
* [sound:女の人_b.mp3]
* [sound:女の人_g.mp3]
