* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bored</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to get tired of</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to lose interest in</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading.  You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />When you start <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to get tired of</span> something you can't help but yawn <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ahh</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あ](https://jisho.org/search/あ)</span>). It doesn't matter how hard you try to hold back. The A-ah's keep coming out.
