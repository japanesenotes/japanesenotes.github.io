## Mnemonics:
すみません、お巡りさん。一番近い交番はどこですか？ある男が私のことをデブと言ったので、警察を呼ぶ必要があるんです。
* Excuse me, officer. Where is the nearest police box? I need to call the police because some man just called me fat.
* I have no idea how this one works, admittedly. You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mix</span> a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> number in a series</span> and you get a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> police box</span>. A police box? Who would want to work in one of those? Think of it this way: all the police have to draw numbers from a hat (they're all mixed up in there). Those who pull out the wrong numbers are on police box duty. That's why mixed numbers in a series = police box. Do you see it?
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 交, 番
* Mix, Number In A Series
* [sound:交番_b.mp3]
* [sound:交番_g.mp3]
