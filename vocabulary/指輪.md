## Mnemonics:
「ボーナスが出たら、ダイヤモンドの指輪を買ってやるよ。」「あなたはいつも口先ばかりでしょ。」
* When I get a bonus, I’ll buy you a diamond ring. You always say that, but words are just words.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> finger</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ring</span> is the kind of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ring</span> you'd put on your finger. That's just simply a ring though, so you'll have to know what ring this is via context.
* The readings come from the individual vocab readings, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [指](https://jisho.org/search/指)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [輪](https://jisho.org/search/輪)</span>. In English we don't distinguish some other ring from a finger ring but in Japanese, you can think of this as two separate words coming together to form one word, which is why it uses the kun'yomi vocab readings like this. So, if you know the individual words, you should be able to figure out this word is read as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ゆびわ</span>.
* 指, 輪
* Finger, Wheel
* [sound:指輪_b.mp3]
