## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> recommend</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to recommend</span>.
* To remember the reading think about how you are going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to recommend</span> this restaurant to your friends, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Sue</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Sue</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すす](https://jisho.org/search/すす)</span>). You refer to them as Sue Sue to make things easier on yourself, and they're always looking for recommendations.
