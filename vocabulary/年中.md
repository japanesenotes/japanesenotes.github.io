## Mnemonics:
この国では一年中雨が降るんだが、妻もまた年中その文句を言うんだ。
* It rains year round in this country and my wife complains about it year round as well.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> year</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> middle</span> sounds like it should be something like the middle of the year, but it's not. Think of something that happens in the middle of the year and then all other parts of the year. It's just referring to everything within this year, which is how we get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> year round</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [中](https://jisho.org/search/中)</span> does have a strange reading, though, which is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゅう]([じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)ゅう)</span>. This is basically just <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちゅう](https://jisho.org/search/ちゅう)</span> changing to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぢゅう]([ぢ](https://jisho.org/search/ぢ)ゅう)</span>, but since nobody uses <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぢ](https://jisho.org/search/ぢ)</span> it just switches to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span> and you end up with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゅう]([じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)ゅう)</span>. That's called rendaku.
* 年, 中
* Year, Middle
