## Mnemonics:
お嬢さんは他の学生よりずっと進んでいる。
* Your daughter is advancing faster than the other students.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> advance</span> so the verb vocab version means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to advance</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />In order <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to advance</span>, you must <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue Sue</span> for her misdeeds against you. Imagine her standing in your way, literally. She keeps saying, You'll have to sue me if you want to get past me! So you do. You sue Sue.
