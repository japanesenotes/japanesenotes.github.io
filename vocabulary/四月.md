## Mnemonics:
四月にりょうしんがりこんしたストレスで、おれのガールフレンドにはすこしひげがはえた。
* My girlfriend suffered from so much stress after her parents divorced in April that she started to grow a little bit of a mustache.
* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [月](https://jisho.org/search/月)</span> in Japanese means moon but it also means month. Why? Probably because the moon takes about a month to get through its cycles. So, what's the fourth moon of the year? Here's a hint, it's the same as the fourth month of the year: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> April</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.<br />Also, this is a specific month, so it uses the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がつ](https://jisho.org/search/がつ)</span> reading.
* 四, 月
* Four, Moon
* [sound:四月_b.mp3]
* [sound:四月_g.mp3]
