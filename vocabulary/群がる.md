## Mnemonics:

* 
* Remember <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [群れる](https://jisho.org/search/群れる)</span>, which means to flock or to crowd.? This also means that!
* The reading is a little different from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [群れる](https://jisho.org/search/群れる)</span>, though. There's an extra <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ら](https://jisho.org/search/ら)</span> in there. That being said, it's pretty similar, so you should be able to use one to remember the other after a few reps. You can also think about it this way: Everyone is flocking together in one place. Strange thing is, it's to a small <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 村</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [むら](https://jisho.org/search/むら)</span>). There's a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [村](https://jisho.org/search/村)</span> reunion going on, that's why.
* 群
* Flock
