## Mnemonics:
その弱々しい患者は河豚の毒で苦しんでいた。
* That weak looking patient is suffering from puffer fish toxins.
* Something that is double <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> weak</span> is probably pretty weak. You also know that this is an adjective because it ends with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>. You know that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [弱い](https://jisho.org/search/弱い)</span> is weak, so it probably isn't that. Instead, this one is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> weak looking</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> frail</span>. If you know the grammar <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [らしい](https://jisho.org/search/らしい)</span> you can kind of use that as a hint. The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しい](https://jisho.org/search/しい)</span> on the end reminds me of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [らしい](https://jisho.org/search/らしい)</span> which is like seems to be. So, seems to be weak = weak looking.
* The reading is double kun'yomi, as you can probably guess due to all the hiragana involved. So, you double up on <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よわ](https://jisho.org/search/よわ)</span> and then add the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しい](https://jisho.org/search/しい)</span> to read this vocabulary word.
* 弱, 々
* Weak, Repeater
