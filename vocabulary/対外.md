## Mnemonics:
アメリカの対外債務が5000億ドルを突破した時に、俺の個人負債が500万ドルを突破したのは、単なる偶然なのか？
* Is it just a coincidence that my personal debt shot past $5 million when America’s foreign debt shot past $500 billion?
* Something is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> versus</span> the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> outside</span>. Back in the day, everything was a battle with the outside. You had the Mongols... the rebels... and the foreigners. So, when you say something is versus the outside you're just saying it's something compared to where you are right now. It's something that's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foreign</span> or from <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> overseas</span>.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 対, 外
* Versus, Outside
* [sound:対外_b.mp3]
* [sound:対外_g.mp3]
