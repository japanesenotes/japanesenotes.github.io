## Mnemonics:
どうして犬の尾を短くする習慣が産まれたのでしょうか。
* Why do you think the custom of shortening dog’s tails started?
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet though, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You look down and you've sprouted a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tail</span>! You're so shocked that all you can say is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Oh</span>. (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)</span>) Oh okay... This your life now. A life with a tail.
* 尾
* Tail
* [sound:尾_b.mp3]
* [sound:尾_g.mp3]
