## Mnemonics:
婆ちゃんの乳はとても長いので、たまに相互に交わることすらできる。
* My grandma’s boobs are so long that they sometimes cross over each other.
* You know that the kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mix</span> and the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [交ぜる](https://jisho.org/search/交ぜる)</span> means to mix, so it probably has something to do with that. This word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to intersect</span>, which is kind of like mixing. When two things intersect with each other, they're getting mixed up, so that's where this word gets its meaning. <br />To remember that this one means to intersect, remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わ](https://jisho.org/search/わ)</span> as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wa</span>lk. You're walking around, and then you intersect with some people on the street.
* The reading is almost the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [交ぜる](https://jisho.org/search/交ぜる)</span> which you should be familiar with by now. It has the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ま](https://jisho.org/search/ま)</span> but it also has an extra <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span> in there. That <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span> is there because you intersect with a group of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mage</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ま](https://jisho.org/search/ま)じ</span>) that catch you on fire as you walk past.
