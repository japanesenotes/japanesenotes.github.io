## Mnemonics:
田村さんは田中さんの個人秘書を一年間務めたんだけど、あまりうまくいかなかったんだよね。
* Mr. Tamura was employed as Ms. Tanaka’s private secretary for one year, but it didn’t really work out.
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> task</span> so what's the verb vocab version? Well, when you do a task, you are going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to work as</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to serve as</span> something to do that task.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br /><span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> To work as</span> my secretary, you will have to complete a task. A task where you bring me <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two toe</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つと](https://jisho.org/search/つと)</span>)! Don't ask me why! You want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to serve as</span> my assistant, right? Just get me those two toes then!
