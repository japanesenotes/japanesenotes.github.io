## Mnemonics:
三段腹を無くすために、毎朝起きたらすぐに100回腹筋をします。
* I do 100 sit-ups every morning right after waking up to get rid of my three pack.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wake up</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to wake up</span>.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji, so tomorrow when you wake up you hopefully won't have to relearn this vocab's reading.
* 起
* Wake Up
* [sound:起きる_b.mp3]
* [sound:起きる_g.mp3]
