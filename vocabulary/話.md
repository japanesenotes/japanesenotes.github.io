## Mnemonics:
「それから、私、他にも言いたいことがあるのよ、ブリタニー！」「ジェレミー、いい加減黙ってくれないか！君の話はもう聞き飽きたよ。」
* Now, I’d also like to say something else, Brittany! Jeremy! Give it a rest! I’m tired of listening to you.
* The kanji version of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [話](https://jisho.org/search/話)</span> means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> talk</span>. This word also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> talk</span>, but it means a few other things as well. This can refer to a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> speech</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> story</span> as well. Basically anything that involves a talking session. So, before you go, I hope you stay awhile and listen to my <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [話](https://jisho.org/search/話)</span>.
* Who tells a great <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> story</span>? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Hana, she</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はなし](https://jisho.org/search/はなし)</span>) tells a great story! If you know someone named Hana or Hanna you can use that person to help you to remember this one better too. <br />You can also use <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [話](https://jisho.org/search/話)す</span>'s reading to help you to remember this one, as well.
