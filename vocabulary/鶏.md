## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: <br />A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chicken</span> is a newer <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [鳥](https://jisho.org/search/鳥)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にわとり](https://jisho.org/search/にわとり)</span>). Well, it's a newer type of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [鳥](https://jisho.org/search/鳥)</span> compared to falcons and condors that have been around for ages. But chickens have only been around as long as us humans. Making them newer birds.
