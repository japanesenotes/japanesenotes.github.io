## Mnemonics:
チェンジビルに引っ越してからというもの、あいつは昔のあいつとは正反対の人間になっちまったんだ。
* He’s the complete opposite of what he used to be like ever since he moved to Changeville.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> anti</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> versus</span>... You'd think this would be a double negative, but it's like a lot of other words where you have two similar words combined... it just means the same thing as those two words. In this case, the anti-versus of something would be the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> opposite</span>. Alternatively, it can be the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> opposition</span>. You choose.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 反, 対
* Anti, Versus
* [sound:反対_b.mp3]
* [sound:反対_g.mp3]
