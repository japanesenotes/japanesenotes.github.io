## Mnemonics:
フグのことが頭から離れないの。これって恋の始まりなのかな？
* I can’t get Fugu out of my head! Is there love in the air?
* When you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> romance</span> you also have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> love</span>! The romantic kind of mushy, gushy love. Be careful though. This word doesn't share its meaning with its kanji. But, that's how romance is. It gets all crazy and turns to love really fast.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word: Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> love</span> isn't toward a person, it's toward this giant <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Koi</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こい](https://jisho.org/search/こい)</span>) fish you met the other day. The fish is just so... so... handsome! You get hearts popping above your head every time you think about this koi!
* 恋
* Romance
* [sound:恋_b.mp3]
* [sound:恋_g.mp3]
