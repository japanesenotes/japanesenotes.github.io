## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> astray</span> and the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to go astray</span> (because you don't just to astray now do you?). You can use it if you ever decide <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to get lost</span>. I'm not sure why you'd do that on purpose, but I don't judge.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />If you are going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to go astray</span>, one way to do it would be to eat wayyyy too much <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mayo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まよ](https://jisho.org/search/まよ)</span>). I can't think of a worse way to go astray, personally.

* Astray
