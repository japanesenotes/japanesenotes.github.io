## Mnemonics:
その男は、叩頭を拒否したため、刑務所に入れられた。
* Since the man refused to kowtow, he was put into a jail.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Strike</span> your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> head</span> against the floor to show your subservient respect by doing the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kowtow</span> bow. This is the most respectful bow you can possibly do. (Thank you China, for bringing this word into Japanese and thank you Japanese for bringing this into English.)
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You haven't learned this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [頭](https://jisho.org/search/頭)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />They used to make you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kowtow</span> every single time you came to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> とうきょう</span>. That's full on head to floor kowtowing in front of everyone who is already in <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span> to prove that you appreciate being there. They might even make you do it these days too, if you're not being respectful enough while you're there.
* 叩, 頭
* Strike, Head
* [sound:叩頭_b.mp3]
* [sound:叩頭_g.mp3]
