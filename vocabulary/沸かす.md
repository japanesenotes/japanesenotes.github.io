* You already learned the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [沸く](https://jisho.org/search/沸く)</span> which means to boil or to grow hot but this is when you are the one heating the water. It still means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to boil</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to heat</span>. But remember that you're the one who is doing the heating.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You already learned this reading when you learned <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [沸く](https://jisho.org/search/沸く)</span>, so you should be able to read this word as well.
