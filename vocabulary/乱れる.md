## Mnemonics:
サーモンと離婚した後、フグは生活が乱れた。
* After his divorce from Salmon, Fugu's life was in disarray.
* The kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> riot</span>, but this verb version word doesn't really mean to riot. It's more like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be in disorder</span>. But if you think about it, when things are rioting and crazy, they definitely are in disorder, so you can think of it that way. You can differentiate this from the future word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [乱す](https://jisho.org/search/乱す)</span> because with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れる](https://jisho.org/search/れる)</span> you know it is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rare</span> for it to be like this. You aren't doing it, but it just happens on occasion (rarely) so you take advantage of it.
* When everything is in disorder it's finally your chance! You run to the bar, break the windows, and grab all the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mead</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みだ](https://jisho.org/search/みだ)</span>) you can carry.
* 乱
* Riot
* [sound:乱れる_b.mp3]
* [sound:乱れる_g.mp3]
