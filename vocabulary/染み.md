## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is the noun version of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [染](https://jisho.org/search/染)</span>. A dye would seem like the right answer, but what else is a dye? If you get it on you when you don't want to get it on you, it becomes a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stain</span>.
* The reading is unlike what you learned with this kanji before. Just think about how you have this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stain</span> on your shirt, all because you were trying to dye some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>) and they didn't like it. So now you have a big dye and sheep poo stain. How were you supposed to know sheep don't like being dyed?!
* 染
* Dye
