## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />The best time to plant <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seedling</span>s is at <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nigh</span>t (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なえ](https://jisho.org/search/なえ)</span>). If you plant them at night they'll sleep through the whole transplanting process and they'll wake up happy and ready to grow.
