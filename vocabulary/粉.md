## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Can also mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flour</span>.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it probably uses the kun'yomi reading. You did not learn this reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember: You have this great ice cream... that is, until your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cone</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こな]([こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)な)</span>) turns to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> powder</span>, and your ice cream falls to the ground. A sonic boom powdered your ice cream cone, and left you very messy.<br />You can also just use <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span> too, it feels a bit older, but it's still a-okay.
