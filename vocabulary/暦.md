## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* When looking at a calendar, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 子読み</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こよみ](https://jisho.org/search/こよみ)</span>) of it is to... well... not be able to read it at all. Because, children can't really read. So, when you look at a calendar you have to explain it to a child, since they cannot read it.
* 暦
* Calendar
