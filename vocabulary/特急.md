## Mnemonics:
特急券を先に買っておいたので、今出れば三時五十分の特急に間に合うよ。
* I already got an express ticket for you, so if you leave now you can still catch the 3:50 express train.
* Something that's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> special</span> and in a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hurry</span> must be special indeed. This refers to limited express trains in Japan. They go fast, they stop at fewer stops (because they're special!) and they hurry. Look out for these if you want to get somewhere in a jiffy.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. Just note that the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とく](https://jisho.org/search/とく)</span> goes to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とっ](https://jisho.org/search/とっ)</span>.
* 特, 急
* Special, Hurry
* [sound:特急_b.mp3]
* [sound:特急_g.mp3]
