## Mnemonics:

* 
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> point</span> of something is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gist</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> principle</span> of it. So, what's the gist of this vocab word? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gist</span> as well.
* The reading is the same as the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [胸](https://jisho.org/search/胸)</span> (chest). So, the gist of your body is your chest (it's at the center, and holds everything together, right?). That's why these words are both read as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> むね</span>.
