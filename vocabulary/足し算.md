## Mnemonics:
今日、学校で足し算の勉強をしました。
* Today we studied addition in school.
* Remember how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [足す]([足](https://jisho.org/search/足)す)</span> means to add? Add <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> calculate</span> to that and you'll have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> addition</span>! It's the type of calculation you're doing when you add.
* This is the kun'yomi reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [足](https://jisho.org/search/足)</span> and the on'yomi for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [算](https://jisho.org/search/算)</span>. And the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さん](https://jisho.org/search/さん)</span> reading is rendaku'd into <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ざん](https://jisho.org/search/ざん)</span>. This is the same for all the math-ish words (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), so try to remember that, because you'll see it again!
* 足, 算
* Foot, Calculate
* [sound:足し算_b.mp3]
