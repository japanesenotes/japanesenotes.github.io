## Mnemonics:

* 
* You are doing a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> set up</span> of something. It's a nice little noun sort of situation, where the word doesn't make too much sense. So, you set yourself up. To do this, you set up a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stance</span> to fight your opponent.
* The reading is like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [構う](https://jisho.org/search/構う)</span>, so as long as you know that you know this too.
