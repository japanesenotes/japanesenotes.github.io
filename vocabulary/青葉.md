## Mnemonics:
お前の頭、ちょっと変なにおいがするぞ。 乾燥した青葉か何かみたいな。
* Your head smells a little weird. It’s like dried up leaves or something.
* So there's this weird thing with Japanese people. Many things that most people would consider green are actually blue in their eyes. So, things like plants and street lights are blue even though you may think of them as green. Remember that for this word, where we talk about a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blue</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> leaf</span>. In your head, though, think green leaf. Now think of all things that have green leaves. This is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> greenery</span>.
* The readings for the kanji in this word are the kun'yomi readings. Since you've already seen the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [青](https://jisho.org/search/青)</span>, hopefully you can just combine it with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [葉](https://jisho.org/search/葉)</span> (you learned the reading for this part with the kanji). Be sure to pay attention to the rendaku, though. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span> goes to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ば](https://jisho.org/search/ば)</span> in this word, making it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> あおば</span>.
* 青, 葉
* Blue, Leaf
