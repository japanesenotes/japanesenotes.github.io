「でも、ママ！僕…」「つべこべ言わないの。さあ、自分の部屋へ行って、宿題をしなさい。」
* But, Mom! I... No buts. Now go to your room and do your homework.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lodge</span> you're staying in has a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> topic</span> around it. Think of it as a theme. This theme is doing your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> homework</span>. So yeah, you just went to a nice lodge for vacation only to have to do homework everywhere.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
