## Mnemonics:

* 
* When you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> board</span> a plane or a car to take a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ride</span> it's called <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boarding</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> embarkation</span>. You have to get on the right way or you can't ride.
* This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You didn't learn this reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [乗](https://jisho.org/search/乗)</span> yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />You know one person who always has a hard time <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boarding</span> a plane, and it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Jou</span>rm (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょう](https://jisho.org/search/じょう)</span>), the simple farmhand. Jourm is what you'd call a very big boy. He doesn't fit in the tube thing you normally walk through when boarding a plane, so he has to climb up the side. It's a whole thing.
* 搭, 乗
* Board, Ride
* [sound:搭乗_b.mp3]
* [sound:搭乗_g.mp3]
