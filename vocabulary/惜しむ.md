## Mnemonics:

* 
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> frugal</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be frugal</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be sparing</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: <br />You should try <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be frugal</span> when you go to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ocea</span>n (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おし](https://jisho.org/search/おし)</span>). There are lots of things to buy, like delicious food, sun hats, and tofugu dolls, but you really shouldn't spend all your money there. Try to plan on spending less when you head to the ocean next time, okay?
