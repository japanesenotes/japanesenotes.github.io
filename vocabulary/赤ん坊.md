## Mnemonics:

* 
* Here's a weird one for you. You have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> red</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> monk</span>. What is this? It's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> baby</span>. Think about it. Babies, when they come out, are all red. Also, they have a shaved head, just like a monk would. So, a red monk is really just a baby. I wonder who's getting the shorter end of the stick here, the monk or the baby? Probably the monk.
* The reading is the kun'yomi vocab reading of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [赤](https://jisho.org/search/赤)</span> (you learned this with the kanji) and the reading you learned for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [坊](https://jisho.org/search/坊)</span> as well.
* 赤, 坊
* Red, Monk
