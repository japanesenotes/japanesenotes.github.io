## Mnemonics:
お兄さんのはなげがきになってしかたがない。
* I can’t help thinking about my older brother’s nose hair.
* This word starts with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)</span> to make it more polite. Then it has the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [兄](https://jisho.org/search/兄)</span></span> which you already know. Lastly, it has <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さん](https://jisho.org/search/さん)</span> which is an honorific to elevate people and be polite. This is basically the formal way of saying older brother (versus plain old <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [兄](https://jisho.org/search/兄)</span>).
* The reading for this one is pretty tricky, and I'd consider it an exception. To remember it, you have to learn the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [兄](https://jisho.org/search/兄)</span> part, and everything else will fall into place. Here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />Your (kind) <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> older brother</span> pushes you down on the ground. You stand up and look at your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> knee</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にい](https://jisho.org/search/にい)</span>), which is all bloody. Why'd you do that to my knee!? you ask. You're supposed to be a nice older brother, that's why I call you <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)兄さん</span>!
* 兄
* Older Brother
* [sound:お兄さん_b.mp3]
* [sound:お兄さん_g.mp3]
