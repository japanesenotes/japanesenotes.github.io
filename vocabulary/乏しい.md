## Mnemonics:

* 
* This is a single kanji with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scarce</span>? It's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scarce</span>.
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: When things are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scarce</span>, you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to bo</span>at (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とぼ](https://jisho.org/search/とぼ)</span>) all the way across the lake to find any resources or food, as your side of the lake is picked dry.
