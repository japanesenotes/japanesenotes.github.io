## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> break</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to break something</span>, because you're doing the breaking. You know this because someone is trying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span>) you for the things you broke of theirs.
* The thing you broke? A beautiful ceramic <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> koa</span>la (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こわ](https://jisho.org/search/こわ)</span>). Watch it shatter to the ground, because you threw it there. What a jerk you are.
* 壊
* Break
