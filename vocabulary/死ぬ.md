## Mnemonics:
私は絶対に死なないと約束するよ。
* I promise you that I will never die.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> death</span>, so the verb version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to die</span>.
* The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji.
* 死
* Death
* [sound:死ぬ_b.mp3]
* [sound:死ぬ_g.mp3]
