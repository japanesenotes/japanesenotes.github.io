## Mnemonics:
私の主人は何の信念も無い政治家なんです。
* My husband is a politician who doesn’t have any conviction.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> master</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> person</span> isn't just a master. You have to think back to when they were making these kanji. Who was the master? It was the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> head of household</span>. This head of household probably told servants what to do and was all bossy and stuff. He was the master person. <br />Also, this often means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> husband</span>. Because, I guess the head of household back in the day was the husband. Those sexist ancient people!
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 主, 人
* Master, Person
