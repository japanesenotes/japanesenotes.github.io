日本で初めて五十音順に配列された国語辞典は、『和訓栞』です。
* The first Japanese dictionary arranged in Japanese syllabary order was the Wakun no shiori.
* This is a little confusing for someone who didn't grow up with the Japanese language. You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fifty</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sound</span>s. Then, they're in a certain <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> order</span>. So, these fifty sounds are the Japanese syllabary. That's hiragana / katakana, probably from back in the day when there were more sounds than there are now. So, the fifty sounds in order makes up <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> aiueo order</span>, where the aiueo is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あいうえお](https://jisho.org/search/あいうえお)</span> representing the five columns.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 五, 十, 音, 順
* Five, Ten, Sound, Order
