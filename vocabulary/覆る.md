## Mnemonics:

* 
* Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> capsize</span> but the verb version is what happens when a plan or idea capsizes. It going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be overturned</span>. It was a bad idea, go back, don't do it or we'll all sink!
* Of all the ideas that need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be overturned</span>, it's the ones from the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [靴](https://jisho.org/search/靴)</span> guy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くつがえ](https://jisho.org/search/くつがえ)</span>). He thinks we should only wear shoes. Not shoes and nothing else, but shoes all over out entire bodies. Yikes, now that's an idea I'd like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to be retracted</span>, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [靴](https://jisho.org/search/靴)</span> guy.
