## Mnemonics:
Tofuguは、常に新しい事を試みる人を探しています。
* Tofugu is looking for someone who always tries to do something new.
* This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span> sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> try</span> so the verb vocab version is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to try</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to attempt</span>.
* You know how when you try to do something you put your whole heart into it? Well, think of that in Japanese. You put your whole <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 心</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こころ](https://jisho.org/search/こころ)</span>) into it.
* 試
* Try
* [sound:試みる_b.mp3]
* [sound:試みる_g.mp3]
