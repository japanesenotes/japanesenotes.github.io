* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> appearance</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> strange</span>. You're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> abnormal</span>. Oh, and you're a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pervert</span> because you look so abnormal. Though you could just be a caterpillar going through your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> metamorphosis</span> to become a butterfly. You just look really weird while the changing is going on.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
