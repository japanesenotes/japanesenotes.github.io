## Mnemonics:
私のお母さんが、若布と豆腐のお味噌汁を作ったんだけど、食べる？
* My mom made a miso soup with wakame seaweed and tofu. Do you want some?
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> young</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cloth</span> for some reason is the seaweed <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wakame</span>. If you've never heard of wakame before, go look it up. It's delicious and really good for you. Seaweed is kind of like cloth in the sea, right? Well, this young cloth is nice and soft and thin, like wakame. I imagine young people are soft and thin too, which is why the young cloth gets to be wakame.
* The reading doesn't make any sense, except for how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [若い](https://jisho.org/search/若い)</span> has <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わか](https://jisho.org/search/わか)</span> in it. If you can figure out the meaning, though, you can use that to remember the reading (since they're the same).
* 若, 布
* Young, Cloth
