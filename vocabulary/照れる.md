## Mnemonics:

* 
* If you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> illuminate</span> the things I've done, I start <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to feel embarrassed</span>. Please don't embarrass me. :(
* Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you: The thing you feel the most embarrassed about is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 手</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [て](https://jisho.org/search/て)</span>). It's all blue and scary looking.
* 照
* Illuminate
* [sound:照れる_b.mp3]
