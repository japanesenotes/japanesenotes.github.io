## Mnemonics:
経験が不足しているうえにいつも寝不足なので、あなたは首です。
* You are fired because you lack experience and are always sleep deprived.
* You have something that's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> not</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sufficient</span>. When something isn't sufficient, you have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shortage</span>. Keep in mind that this is a physical shortage, not a shortage of mental ability or something like that. To remember this, just think about how <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [足](https://jisho.org/search/足)</span> also means foot. What is a foot? Something physical. That's why this is a physical shortage.
* This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.
* 不, 足
* Not, Foot
* [sound:不足_b.mp3]
* [sound:不足_g.mp3]
