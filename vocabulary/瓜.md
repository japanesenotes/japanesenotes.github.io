## Mnemonics:

* 
* The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.
* Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this reading yet though, so here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />Bite into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> melon</span> and what do you taste? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Uni ree</span>se's pieces (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うり](https://jisho.org/search/うり)</span>)! Did you know that? The next time you eat a melon see if you can taste the difference!
