## Mnemonics
 * The sun hits this and breaks into three <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span>s. What can split the sun in three directions? A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crystal</span>!
* Crystals take light and refract it around into many directions. That's why there are three suns in this kanji.
* Who is hoarding and harnessing the power of these <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crystal</span>s? That would be the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>).
* Imagine the Shougun laying in his bed of crystals. He still has his really serious, angry face though. Even as he rubs the crystals to his face, he's glowering.
