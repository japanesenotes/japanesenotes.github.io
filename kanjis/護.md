## Mnemonics
 * They <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> that <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> held by a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span> are good to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> defend</span> yourself with. Even better than a guard dog they say. People are so confused by the turkey sitting on a stool holding flowers that they just lose their will to fight. This turkey is great to defend yourself and your home.
* Picture this turkey holding its flowers while sitting on its stool. Hear it gobbling as it defends everything around it with its mere presence.
* The only thing this flower bearing turkey cannot <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> defend</span> against is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Go</span>dzilla (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ご](https://jisho.org/search/ご)</span>). Godzilla is pretty much undefeatable, especially for a turkey. The turkey is totally unable to defend anything from the mighty Godzilla.
* Imagine Godzilla approaching the flower turkey. Hear Godzilla roar as the turkey gobbles in fear before being crushed beneath the massive and scaly foot of Godzilla.
