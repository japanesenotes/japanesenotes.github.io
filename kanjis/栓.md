## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span> has a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hat</span> that's made from a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> but the more you look at it, the more it looks like it's just a big <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cork</span>. It's a big, wooden <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> plug</span> that he's just placed on his head. It can hardly be called a hat.
* Picture how silly the king looks with this cork on his head. He kind of looks like a fat, plugged up bottle of wine when he yells now.
* It turned out this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cork</span> hat was given to him by a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cen</span>taur (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span>). You look into it and it turned out it IS a really big cork that centaurs use on their big wine casks. But the king didn't understand, and thought it was a hat. The centaurs are probably still laughing.
* Picture the centaurs drinking and giggling, putting the cork from their wine on their head to imitate the stupid king.
