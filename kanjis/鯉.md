## Mnemonics
 * If you're in Japan (which is the end goal here, let's be honest) then the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fish</span> in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> village</span> are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> carp</span>. You may know them as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> koi</span>, too.
* Picture your village in Japan. There's a big, still pond full of bright and beautiful giant carp. You hear the village kids giggle as they feed them and their big round mouths pop out of the water.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> carp</span> is called a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> koi</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こい](https://jisho.org/search/こい)</span>) in Japanese. We've used that word before so I hope you know it by now. A koi is a koi, you know?
* Carp are koi and koi are carp. Blub blub.
