## Mnemonics
 * If you have nothing to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eat</span> but your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ego</span>, you'll <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> starve</span>. You can't eat it, and your ego is keeping you from accepting actual food or help from other people.
* You have to check your ego at the door, because you'll definitely starve otherwise.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> starve</span> (thanks ego) and turn into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ga</span>rgoyle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [が](https://jisho.org/search/が)</span>). As your stomach aches, your skin turns gray and you slowly harden into a crouched position.
* Now your starved body has been moved to the top of a castle, where you scare away people and birds with your loud grumbling stomach and scary face.
