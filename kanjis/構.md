## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lifeguard</span> will choose a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> set up</span> the station where he'll <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> care</span> for the people on the beach and in the water. Trees provide the shade lifeguards need to take care of half-drowned kids and grannies with sand stuck in their bathing suits. That's why they set up their care stations here.
* Watch the lifeguard walk around the beach. He needs to pick a nice big tree for his set up, so he can provide the best care possible.
* You look closer at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> set up</span> and realize the lifeguard is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>! You know he teaches Japanese but... is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち]([こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち)</span> really qualified to care for people like this?
* Imagine <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち]([こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち)</span> setting up a care station. You hope you don't get in trouble in the water so you don't have to see how good he is at caring for people.<br />Hint: when you see the lifeguard radical, the reading is probably going to be <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)</span>.
