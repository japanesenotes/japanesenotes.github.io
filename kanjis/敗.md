## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> that can't live in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> failure</span>. Any proper shellfish would survive through the winter, but there are always a few failures every year.
* Imagine you're a shellfish in the cold, cold winter. The water is freezing but you must tough it out so no one will say you're a failure in spring when they find your dead shellfish body.
* The best way to avoid <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> failure</span> is to say a little <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hai</span>ku (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はい](https://jisho.org/search/はい)</span>) to distract you from the cold. In fact, this can work in any situation where you're afraid of failure. Say a haiku aloud, it will calm your nerves and warm you from the inside.
* Imagine being a shellfish freezing in the cold winter water, but you avoid failure by muttering haiku over and over to keep you warm and determined.
