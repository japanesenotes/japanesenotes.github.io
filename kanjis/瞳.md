## Mnemonics
 * Inside your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eye</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stand</span>s a tiny <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> village</span> that makes up your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pupil</span>. That's the black part of your eye!
* Oh, did you think your pupil was a hole? No, no, you misunderstand. That's where the village stands. It's full of little people who whisper to your brain what you should see.
* All of the people in your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pupil</span> eat <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dou</span>ghnuts (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [どう](https://jisho.org/search/どう)</span>) all day long. That's why your eye is shaped like a doughnut, with the hole (village) as their home.
* Even if you're a pupil non-believer, at least you can see how it's shaped like a doughnut hole, right?
