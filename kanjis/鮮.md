## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fish</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sheep</span> are very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fresh</span> here. This is a great place to get fresh fish and fresh sheep. I kid you not.
* Imagine eating this fresh fish and fresh sheep. It’s the freshest you’ve ever tasted. Taste it on your tongue and experience how fresh it is.
* This place also serves <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fresh</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cen</span>taur (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span>), but that’s just weird. Centaur is endangered and you don’t believe in eating endangered things. Even if they are incredibly fresh.
* Can you imagine eating a fresh centaur? How weird would that be? Half of it is human-like, so you’d be like, a half cannibal. Weird, huh?
