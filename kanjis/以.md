## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lion</span> drops a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> of saliva onto this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> person</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> from</span> above. The person is in a much worse place <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> compared with</span> where they were before, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> since</span> they only just recently fell into this pit.
* Picture the person, the lion is leaning over them, the drop of spit dangling from their mouth. I-I want to go back where I came from, the person gasps, shaking.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> From</span> above there is a loud caw, and a giant <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>) swoops down, forcing the lion to back off. The eagle grabs the person with its talons, bringing him into the air! But now he's... in the air being carried by a giant eagle, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> compared with</span> where he was before, is this really better?!
* The eagle came from the sky and technically rescued him, but compared to where he was before, it may not be a better situation. I think this person is going to be eaten either way.
