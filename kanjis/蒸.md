## Mnemonics
 * If you take the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> off some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> coral</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> boil</span> them, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> steam</span> comes out.
* Steam comes out of the coral flowers because they hold a lot of water. They're flowers, but they're coral flowers, so they came from the ocean. Of course there's water in them, and if you boil that water steam will come out.
* As you watch the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> steam</span> coming off the coral flowers, someone appears behind you. It is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Jou</span>rm (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょう](https://jisho.org/search/じょう)</span>), the big farmhand. Are you steaming coral? he asks. Smelled it a mile away. I love crunching me some coral.
* It's weird that Jourm is so sensitive to the smell of steaming coral. He's lived as a farmhand nowhere near the sea all his life... at least that's what he told you. And now he's in your house breathing in the steam really deeply with his nose practically in the pot.
