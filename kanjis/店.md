## Mnemonics
 * A long time ago, someone put up a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> canopy</span> over their <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fortune</span> telling booth and created the first <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shop</span>. This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> store</span> was fortune-based, but since then lots of different stores have popped up!
* Picture the very first store in history. A fortune teller decided enough was enough, they should be in some kind of structure where it's safe, official looking, and more permanent.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shop</span> quickly turned into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ten</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てん](https://jisho.org/search/てん)</span>) shops! It was a good idea, after all, so all of the other people selling goods and services decided to copy it and create their own shops. The next day there were ten more.
* Picture ten shops, all made up of someone selling something under a canopy. The first one is the fortune teller, but the nine others are whatever you want them to be!
