## Mnemonics
 * Taking a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span>, you walk through the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> direction</span> of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spread</span> your arms wide. You spread your arms to halt the approach of winter because your rice paddy is not done growing yet. You take the cross with you for some extra religious power of persuasion.
* Imagine facing the direction of the approaching winter while facing away from the rice paddy. Feel the weight of the cross in your hands as you spread your arms and implore the winter to hold off on its arrival.
* You’re actually a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Sheikh</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しき]([し](https://jisho.org/search/し)き)</span>) (an Arab leader) which makes the fact that you’re holding a cross while you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spread</span> your arms even more of a big deal. You spread your arms wider than any Sheikh ever has before.<br />Side note: The official kun'yomi reading is just <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span> but since no vocab words ever use <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>, we're teaching you <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しき]([し](https://jisho.org/search/し)き)</span>, which includes what used to be okurigana but is never used outside of the kanji anymore.
* Feel the strain on your Sheikh arms as you continue to spread them. Since you’re a Sheikh, you have to set a good example for your people, so don’t let them (or your arms) down.
