## Mnemonics
 * Put the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> prison</span> and everything will always be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> in season</span>. If the sun is in prison, the season's can't change. Want to wear a giant weenie costume all year round? Put the sun in prison on Halloween. Now your weenie body is always in season because it's always the same <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> time of month</span>.
* You're welcome. Now you know how to keep everything in season. Lifehack!
* When things are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> in season</span> for too long, people are going to wonder what's going on. When's Christmas? When's Golden Week? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Soon</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅん](https://jisho.org/search/しゅん)</span>), you say. Soon enough, it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> June</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゅん](https://jisho.org/search/じゅん)</span>) which is the middle of the year so everything is soon.
* Jokes on them though. Halloween will be in season forever now. Soon it will be Halloween. Soon it will be time for candy. Soon June will end and people will forget about everything else.
