## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> are <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> private</span>, no one can see them unless they <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pay</span>! And you decide if what they pay is enough to get a peek.
* Imagine people coming from miles around to pay for a look at your private fingers.
* If someone tries to look without paying, that's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hara</span>ssment (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はら](https://jisho.org/search/はら)</span>)! Nobody gets to see something of yours without proper payment, but more importantly, your consent!
* If somebody looks at your fingers without paying, without your consent, file a harassment claim on their butt! That is NOT okay!
