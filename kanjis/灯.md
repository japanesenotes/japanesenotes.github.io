## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Fire</span> you use to light up the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> street</span> needs to go in a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lamp</span>. Campfires, matches? No, none of those work. You need bright, safe lamps to keep the street nice at night.
* Picture these lamps lining the street, with their little fires burning brightly. Nowadays we don't have real fire in them, we use electricity!
* These street <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lamp</span>s were first used in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> とうきょう</span>. It was the most advanced city after all. And more people were out at night in <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span> than anywhere else in Japan. So they needed lamps to light things up!
* Picture <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span>, not lit up by all of the electricity, signs, shops, and things that light up its streets today, but by old-fashioned fire lamps!
