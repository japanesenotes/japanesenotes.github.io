## Mnemonics
 * If you see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spirit</span> with an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> axe</span>, you better <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pray</span> for your life. Spirits only hold axes if they're thinking about murder, so pray as hard as you can to try and get it to spare you.
* Imagine trying to pray as hard as you can as a spirit with an axe closes in on you. Can you hold your prayer concentration long enough?
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pray</span> and pray and pray and nothing happens. You stop praying and dare to open your eyes. There is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>) in front of you. Grab the key and hold it before you and pray for the spirit to take it. Moments later, both the key and the spirit are gone.
* I guess the key was prayer all along. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
