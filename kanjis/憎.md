## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> soul</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mask</span> helps you to see the deepest part of anyone's soul. You look around and in all the people you only see <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hate</span>.
* You're supposed to see all the emotions, so why do you only see hate inside everyone?
* It turns out you're not looking at normal people. You see so much <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hate</span> because all the people you're looking at are actually just a group of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> zo</span>mbies (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぞう](https://jisho.org/search/ぞう)</span>).
* Zombies are pretty filled with hate, so it makes sense that you'd see a bunch of hate if you used the soul mask on them.
