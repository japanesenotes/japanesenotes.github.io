## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> narwhal</span> sticks a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stick</span> into the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> to see what might <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exist</span> underneath it. Narwhals live in the sea, you see. So they're convinced nothing can exist anywhere else.
* Imagine seeing a narwhal sticking a stick, and maybe even its horn too, into the dirt on land. It needs to know if life exists outside of the ocean for sure.
* The narwhal can't find anything but it can't stop thinking about what could <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exist</span> outside of its world. It pulls out a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> xy</span>lophone (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ざい](https://jisho.org/search/ざい)</span>) and starts tapping the keys with its horn. It plays a sad song about the meaning of life and whether existence is worth it.
* Hear the plinky plink of the xylophone and think about what exists in this world. It's a sad song, you realize.
