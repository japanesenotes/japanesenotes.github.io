* Picture yourself climbing stairs, picture going from room to room. From place to place. From wherever you were to wherever you want to be.
* If you're going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> from</span> place to place, you should really make sure you have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kni</span>fe (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ない](https://jisho.org/search/ない)</span>) on you for protection. If you want to make it far enough from home you should seriously consider it. Knives keep everyone safe when they're going far from home.
* Imagine yourself taking those first few steps from home, knife heavy in your pocket. You can go as far from home as you want now. The knife will keep you safe.
