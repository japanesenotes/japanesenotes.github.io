## Mnemonics
 * You give a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bow</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stick</span> to your friend's family. This is because your friend died, and he loved bows and sticks. You give this to his family, to give our <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> condolence</span>s.
* Imagine looking at the bow and stick as you slide them over to your deceased friend's family. This won't do enough, but it is a little condolence at least.
* More than a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> condolence</span>, you want to avenge your friend's death. He was killed by Mrs. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chou</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょう](https://jisho.org/search/ちょう)</span>), and she broke his stick and bow, which is why you got the family a new set.
* Imagine her saying, My condolences, as Mrs. Chou does him in.
