## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> river</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> river</span> kanji are the same as each other!
* So, if you know the radical you know the kanji as well.
* So you're in a river. As you're floating down, enjoying yourself, you bump into something. It says moo to you. You look around. There are hundreds of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cow</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かわ](https://jisho.org/search/かわ)</span>) surrounding you. 
* Touch them as you float by. Smell them. Is the river filled with cow poop? Probably. Use that to help you to remember that you run into cows when you're in the river.
