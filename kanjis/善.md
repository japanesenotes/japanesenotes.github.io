## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sheep</span> loses its <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> so it picks them up in his <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> to take them to a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> morally good</span> doctor who is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> good</span> enough to attach them back onto his head. This poor sheep lost his horns and now feels quite sad. Sheep don’t have hands, so the sheep had to pick the horns up off the ground with his mouth. An evil doctor would just murder the sheep and steal his horns, so the sheep must find a morally good doctor to reaffix them.
* Imagine yourself as the good doctor being approached by this forlorn sheep without horns. Hear the clack of the horns together as the sheep drops them out of his mouth onto the ground and lets out a pathetic bleat. “Baa~aa~ah~”
* Since you are a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> morally good</span> doctor, you decide not to murder the sheep and harvest its organs. Instead, as a practitioner of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> good</span> teachings of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Zen</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぜん](https://jisho.org/search/ぜん)</span>) Buddhism, you decided to help the sheep out. Your Zen teachings have only increased the power of your healing abilities, so you fix the sheep up in no time.
* Imagine yourself using your Zen magic to heal this sheep. Place your hands on the sheep’s horns and imagine returning them to their rightful location on the sheep’s head. Feel the soft wool of the sheep as he bleats in happiness.
