## Mnemonics
 * Where do you put your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> when you're on an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> escalator</span>? On the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> handle</span>! Okay, so maybe it's not a handle and more of a railing, but for the sake of this kanji, picture a handle instead.
* Imagine being on an escalator and wrapping your fingers around a small handle on your way up or down. It's still a bit precarious, truth be told.
* You put your hand on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> handle</span> and an old person leans in close to you and says, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 暑か</span>? (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あつか](https://jisho.org/search/あつか)</span>). He wants to know if the handle is ... hot? Before you can respond he says it again, and again! “<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [暑か？！ 暑か？！？！ 暑か？！？！？！]([暑か](https://jisho.org/search/暑か)？！ 暑か？！？！ 暑か？！？！？！)</span>” he's shouting as you slowly ride the escalator away from him.
* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [暑か](https://jisho.org/search/暑か)</span>? Is the handle hot? Think about it. Is it? What does your imagination tell you?
