## Mnemonics
 * As the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> hits your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> and your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> car</span>, it alters the wave, creating <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ripples</span>.
* They're hard to see because a tsunami is pretty big, but your scooter and car do create ripples in the water as it goes past.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ripples</span> come off of your scooter and car from when they were hit by a tsunami. More importantly, those things were <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ren</span>tals (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れん](https://jisho.org/search/れん)</span>), so ripples or not, it doesn't matter if they were hit by a tsunami.
* As you watch the ripples come off your car / scooter, be sure to imagine the relief you'd feel if you knew they were rentals and not something owned by you.
