## Mnemonics
 * To the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mountain</span>s you took your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horned</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> husband</span> for you two to get married. (Society wouldn't accept a horned husband!) To hide even more from the prying eyes of society, you take your horned husband into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ravine</span>.
* Imagine walking up the mountain in your wedding clothes so you can get married without anyone trying to stop you. Then, because you're still worried, you go into a ravine where you are read your marriage vows.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ravine</span> is still in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> きょうと</span> though, because if you went outside the city your marriage wouldn't be legal. So you found a secluded, local ravine.
* This ravine runs right through the middle of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょうと](https://jisho.org/search/きょうと)</span>, though most people don't notice it. That makes it the best place for a secret wedding to a horned freak-husband.
