## Mnemonics
 * You <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> poop</span> twice on a sleeping <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> person</span> and you find yourself wondering <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> how many</span> more times you can poop on them and wonder <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> how much</span> they can take before they realize what’s going on.
* You’ve already pooped twice on this drunkard, how many more times can you do it? How much do you think this person can take? Just imagine yourself doing this.
* As you continue thinking about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> how much</span> poop this drunkard can take and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> how many</span> more poops you can drop on him, he begins to wake up. Quickly, you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eke</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いく](https://jisho.org/search/いく)</span>) out one last poop before you scurry away. You eke that poop out just in time to make your escape.
* Imagine yourself as you eke out that last poop. Really concentrate on eking it out so you can get away in time. Flex your butt muscles for added effect.
