## Mnemonics
 * Someone is reaching out with their <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> call</span> for you. They <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beckon</span> you closer, this way.
* Something about the way they're beckoning you with their fingers is really enticing. You can't help but walk toward them.
* The person <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beckon</span>ing you is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>). You can't help but obey the Shougun's beckoning call.
* Even if the Shougun didn't have an army that would crush you if you didn't come when he called, you'd go anyway. Those beckoning fingers are just so... weirdly enticing.
