## Mnemonics
 * Take your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spoon</span> to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> to be able to take a bite. It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> delicious</span>, you hear. That's the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> point</span> of the spoon.
* Taste that delicious sun. It doesn't even burn!
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> delicious</span> taste is... familiar somehow. You take a few more bites and then scream. It tastes like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>)!
* You had your eyes closed because the sun is so bright. When you open them you realize the delicious sun you were eating is really just a giant, really bright, cooked sheep. You should probably point this out to NASA or something.
