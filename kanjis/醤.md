## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> commander</span>'s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> alcohol</span> is really just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soy sauce</span>. When he goes out to drink with his troops and they all get drunk together, he manages to have fun and stay sober by drinking down a tasty, non-alcoholic pint of soy sauce.
* The next time you go to a bar, order yourself a commander's alcohol. It's like saying you want a Roy Rogers or a Shirley Temple, except it isn't pretty and it tastes horrible.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Soy sauce</span> also happens to be the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun's (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>) favorite drink. Unfortunately, he can't just tell people he likes drinking glasses of soy sauce, or they'll look at him weird. Instead he orders it as a commander's alcohol too.
* Picture the Shougun sitting on his throne, guzzling down some salty, brown soy sauce. It's splashing on his robes and the smell is making his assistants gag.
