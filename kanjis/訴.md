## Mnemonics
 * You <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> you have an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> axe</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> of blood on it. You hit someone with that axe and now they're going to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue</span> you. That drop of blood on your axe is pretty incriminating, which is why they have enough of a case to sue you.
* Imagine being unable to stop yourself from saying I have the axe with the drop on it! and the recently axed person jumps out from behind a bush and shouts, Aha! I'm gonna sue you!
* You want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue</span> them back so you clean the axe with some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> so</span>ap (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そ](https://jisho.org/search/そ)</span>). Your honor, you say in court, I don't see any drops of blood, I countersue!
* The person you axed cries and tries desperately to find their blood on the axe so they can keep suing you properly. You hold the soap behind your back and cackle.
