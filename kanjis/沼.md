 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> can't resist the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> call</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bog</span>. Whenever a tsunami is headed toward land, a bog will always call out to it, Hey tsunami, don't you want to hit me with your water? Come this way~
* Close your eyes and hear the bog's temping call.

You open your eyes and it's just a bog. You close your eyes, and there he is. The Numa Numa guy.
