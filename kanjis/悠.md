 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> who usually hits you with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stick</span> in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> finds it in his <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span> to give you some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> leisure</span> time.
* You fall to your knees, Oh thank you for not hitting me with your stick and letting me relax! You haven't had a moment of leisure in ages!

You look back for the leader, and he's wearing a bathrobe, sunglasses, and is drinking some hot cocoa. Wait... this is leisure time for... HIM?! OH NO!
* As the leader leisurely watches, the youths smack you with their sticks. What a cruel world! Enjoy your leisure time, the leader yells over, the youths hit much softer than I do. Have fun!
