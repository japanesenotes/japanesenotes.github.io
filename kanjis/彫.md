## Mnemonics
 * There is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> circumference</span> around someone's <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hair</span>, as in, you can see a circle drawn around the top of their head. As you examine it closer, and pull at it a bit, you realize that someone has <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> carve</span>d the hair off someone's head!
* Their hair has literally been carved out of their head, and you discovered it. Of course, the nastiness, the smell, and the feel should be applied to your imagination to make the mnemonic stronger.
* When you think of all the people who could have done this... all the people who could have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> carve</span>d out someone's hair, only one person comes to mind, and that is Mrs. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chou</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょう](https://jisho.org/search/ちょう)</span>). She's the only person evil enough to do something like this.
* You can also imagine Mrs. Chou doing the act of carving someone's hair out, but that may just be too much.
