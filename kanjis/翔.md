## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sheep</span> with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> feathers</span> (and presumably wings, too) is able to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fly</span>.
* Imagine the sheep with feathers taking off and flying around. It's an odd sight, but makes sense, kind of.
* Using this sheep that can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fly</span>, you're going to get rich! But there's a problem... you have to catch the sheep. So, you get some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cake</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かけ](https://jisho.org/search/かけ)</span>) and use it to lure the sheep to your trap, where you catch it!
* Ha HA! Everyone knows sheep love cake. Works every time. Now this flying sheep is yours!
