## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> big</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> has to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> measure</span> a safe before he can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rob</span> it. If the safe is too big it won’t fit in his getaway van and the robbery will have been a failure. So before the turkey robs the place he needs to measure the safe.
* Imagine this turkey as he tries to rob this safe. See him with the tape measure as he determines whether or not the safe is too big.
* The safe that the turkey is trying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rob</span> ends up being <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> uber</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うば](https://jisho.org/search/うば)</span>) big. Like, really uber big. So uber big that the turkey can’t even measure it with his tape measure. There’s no way he’s gonna be able to rob this place.
* Imagine the size of this uber big safe. What could be inside? Probably something good.
