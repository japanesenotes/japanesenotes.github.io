## Mnemonics
 * If you look in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tiger</span>'s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stomach</span> you'll find a bunch of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> skin</span>. It's really gross but what else did you think you'd find? Everyone knows tigers can't digest the skin of the things it eats. 
* Imagine yourself opening a tigers mouth and looking all the way down into its stomach and seeing a bunch of skin. Why would you imagine that? Eww.
* The only person who would try to take <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> skin</span> from a tiger's stomach is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foo</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>). You'll probably get your head bitten off looking for skin that way.  
* Imagine a fool trying to pull skin out of a tiger's stomach. You can imagine them getting their skin added to the pile too if you want.
