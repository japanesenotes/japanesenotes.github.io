## Mnemonics
 * You have a wild <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> viking</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> child</span> you have to take care of. He won't do anything but <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> study</span>, surprisingly. You can't get him to eat, use the bathroom, or anything else. He just wants to study.
* Of course, this isn't what you'd expect of a little viking child. It's the opposite. That's why it's so surprising! He loves to study!
* This crazy viking child who prefers <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> study</span> over pillaging (and other viking activities)... the other vikings just stop and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gawk</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がく](https://jisho.org/search/がく)</span>) at him when they walk by.
* You should tell the other vikings to stop gawking at this child. Just because he likes to study doesn't mean he's a bad viking...
