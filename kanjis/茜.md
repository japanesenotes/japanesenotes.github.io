## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Flowers</span> that grow in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> west</span> are colored by the sun setting so they turn bright red. That's why red flowers that grow in the west are used to make <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> red dye</span>. They're the closest to the actual color of the red sun, so they're prized by painters and other artists for their perfect color for dye.
* Picture yourself sitting in the west as the red sun sets, smashing those pretty red flowers into a paste to make red dye. Your fingers get dyed red too and you crush the petals into a paste.
* As you're smashing the flowers into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> red dye</span>, a little girl comes up to you and points at the paste. She says, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 赤ね</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あかね](https://jisho.org/search/あかね)</span>)? (That's red, right?) You look down at the red dye on your fingers and nod. She's right, it is red.
* Hear the little girl say <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あかね](https://jisho.org/search/あかね)</span> while pointing to the red dye. She's right. And the way she says it is so darn cute.
