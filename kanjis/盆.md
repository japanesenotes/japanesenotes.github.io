## Mnemonics
 * I found <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> part</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> plate</span> at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lantern festival</span>. There is a legendary plate broken into three parts. One part of the plate I found was at the lantern festival. The lantern festival was pretty cool, but I’m really glad I found the part of that plate I was looking for.
* Imagine holding this part of the plate in your hands as the light from the lanterns glitters off it and dances around, illuminating the background. It’s enchanting.
* The plate part you found at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lantern festival</span> is made out of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bone</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼん](https://jisho.org/search/ぼん)</span>) china. How fancy. Is bone china made from real bones? Bones found in China? Probably not, huh.
* Tap this bone china plate with your knuckle. Hear the pleasant tap as you continue to view all the fancy lanterns around you at the festival.
