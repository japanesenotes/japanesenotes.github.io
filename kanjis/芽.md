## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fang</span> is the bud that comes out of the ground. It's like a little fang, coming from the earth, and it will become a flower someday. This is a little <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sprout</span>.
* Imagine a bunch of these. They look like big fangs poking out of the ground (that is, until they bloom and get into the air).
* When the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sprout</span> gets out of the ground and opens up, instead of a flower there is a human-looking <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 目</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [め](https://jisho.org/search/め)</span>), looking right at you.
* You look at all the sprouts. They have all turned into <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [目](https://jisho.org/search/目)</span>s, looking straight at you. You're terrified.
