## Mnemonics
 * You want to put this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> towel</span> over this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scarecrow</span>, but you have to measure its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> width</span> first. If the towel doesn't have a greater width than the scarecrow, some of it will be showing. Which you definitely don't want.
* The scarecrow creeps you out. You don't want to look at it anymore, so you're standing eerily close to it measuring its width, so you can hide it forever.
* You finish measuring the the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> width</span> of the scarecrow and the width of the towel, and you realize you're the width of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> haba</span>nero (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はば](https://jisho.org/search/はば)</span>) pepper short. This is fine, you grow those. This is a whole field of habaneros! So you pluck one off the nearest plant, tape it to the cloth, and cover that scarecrow right up.
* Do you know the width of a habanero? It's one scarecrow minus one cloth.
