## Mnemonics
 * Taking a piece of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> blame</span> the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exploits</span> of your past on poor judgment. You tie this thread around your finger to remind you of all the exploits you accomplished in your day. Most of them weren’t actually on purpose, so you blame them on poor judgment and accident.
* Think up what exploits you accomplished. What sort of things might you have done, but not quite on purpose? Think about how it feels to be exalted for such exploits that were but mere accidents.
* One of your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exploits</span> was when you got dressed in the dark and were wearing funny clothes and everyone thought that it was <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sexy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せき](https://jisho.org/search/せき)</span>). The newspapers and fashion agencies couldn’t get enough of your sexy style.
* Imagine setting this sexy fashion trend on accident. Imagine what you were wearing when you got dressed in the dark. Probably a pretty strange, mismatched outfit.
