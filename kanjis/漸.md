## Mnemonics
 * You're stuck in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> car</span> during a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> and all you have to break out is an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> axe</span>. You whack and whack but you're only <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gradually</span> making progress. You thought an axe would be an easy way to get out of a car but it's not working like you'd planned! You have to make more than gradual progress if you don't want to drown. 
* Imagine gradually denting your car door open with an axe while you're trapped in a tsunami. This isn't fast enough! 
* As you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gradually</span> making your door open with the axe you look up to see the New York Yankees floating by on top of their bus. You yell, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> YO YA</span>NKEES (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ようや](https://jisho.org/search/ようや)</span>) to get their attention. They see your gradual progress and start throwing balls at your car to help dent it open.
* YO YANKEES! Gradually yelling that saved your life!
