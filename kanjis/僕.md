## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> business</span>? Ha! That's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> me</span>! That's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> I</span>!
* This version of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> I</span> is more boyish. It's a sort of young man/boy way of saying I, though you'll hear women use it too sometimes (it's a teensy bit tomboyish though).
* You use the word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> I</span> a lot. You say it so much, you just start referring to yourself with the french <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beaucoup</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼく](https://jisho.org/search/ぼく)</span>) for a lot. Because you love yourself a lot.
* I am beaucoup I am. (Is that a pun? Did I do it right?) I dunno. Just say <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼく](https://jisho.org/search/ぼく)</span> a lot and try to connect all of your approximate knowledges of languages together. Merci <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼく](https://jisho.org/search/ぼく)</span> from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼく](https://jisho.org/search/ぼく)</span>.
