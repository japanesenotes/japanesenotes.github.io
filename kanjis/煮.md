## Mnemonics
 * If <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> someone</span> wants to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> boil</span>, you let them <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boil</span>!
* There's someone in your face yelling about how they want to boil! You yell back, Okay, if you want to boil, just boil!
* Welp, the pot is at a rolling <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boil</span> and your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> knee</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [に](https://jisho.org/search/に)</span>) is in there. The person wasn't saying they wanted to boil, they said they wanted to boil someone. And that meant you. Well, your knee anyway.
* Once your knee is done boiling, the person kneels down in front of you and presents it on a platter, mocking you, since you can't kneel anymore. You should pay more attention to what's going on from now on or you could find yourself in... HOT WATER. Ohohoho.
