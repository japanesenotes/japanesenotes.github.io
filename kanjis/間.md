## Mnemonics
 * Think of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gate</span> that the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> has to go through every time it revolves around in the sky (this is ancient China's sun). Someone at the gate checks the time, and makes sure the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> interval</span> is correct, then waves it through the gate for another pass, where it creates its next interval of time.
* Interval is a weird word to remember, but just think of the sun going around the earth and through the gate just like clockwork. Every 24 hours it passes through the gate, and each interval is exactly the same.
* This method of keeping track of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> interval</span>s of time was invented by the great Khans of Mongolia, specifically the most famous Khan of all: Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>).<br />Genghis Khan has had a huge impact on the world as we know it, especially the Eurasian continent of the past, so he's going to come up a lot from now on. Be prepared to get very familiar with him and his friends!
* Picture Genghis Khan ordering his most skilled inventors and builders to create this special sun gate so they can harness the power of intervals, and all people under his rule can benefit from the accurate telling of time.
