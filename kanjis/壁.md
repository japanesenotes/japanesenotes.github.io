## Mnemonics
 * There are <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hot peppers</span> hiding in this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span>, so you build a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wall</span> to protect yourself from them. Have you ever stepped on a really hot pepper? The oils bleed into your shoes and burn your feet! You don't want anyone stepping on these so you wall them up.
* Picture yourself walking around and seeing a wall around some dirt. You look inside and there are some hot peppers hiding just below the surface. Phew! Good thing this wall was here to protect you from them. 
* On the other side of this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wall</span> there are much less threatening <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cob</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かべ](https://jisho.org/search/かべ)</span>) of corn. Corn isn't spicy. It's delicious and sweet, so it's free from being walled in.
* Picture some corn cobs. Now picture some hot peppers. Put a wall between them.
