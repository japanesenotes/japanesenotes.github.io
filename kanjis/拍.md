## Mnemonics
 * You're tapping your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> against a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> white</span> wall when you realize the sound you're making is actually a sick <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beat</span>. You keep going and start singing along. Boo boo boop. Boo do do do doop! Finger beats!
* Imagine yourself in a completely white room. All you have is the white walls, your fingers, and your beats. When you stop all you're left with is white noise. Yuck! Keep those beats coming!
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beat</span> is sick, but as you tap you realize you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hack</span>ing (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はく](https://jisho.org/search/はく)</span>) up the wall! Slowly but surely, your fingers are hacking out little bits of the wall. And the beats don't sound as good until you move to a new, clean white area.
* Imagine hacking the wall apart as you try to keep this beat going. The music is all you have, man! You can't lose the beat now!
