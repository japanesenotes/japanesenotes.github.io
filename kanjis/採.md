Gather it in a pile or a bag, just make sure it's all in one place so you can take a closer look later.
* Picture your fingers really getting in there to gather the tree pieces from out of this cleat. Some of the tree bits are stabbing under your fingernails, but you have to keep gathering them, don't stop now!
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gather</span> them all together and realize there are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cy</span>borg (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さい](https://jisho.org/search/さい)</span>) parts mixed in with the tree bits. Uh oh, it's as you feared. Your cyborg definitely got into trouble somewhere around here and you walked all over it with your cleats.
* Gather all of these cyborg bits so you can find it and reattach them later.
