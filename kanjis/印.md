## Mnemonics
 * You take this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> comb</span>, break the handle off, and use it to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stamp</span> your official <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seal</span> of approval onto a document. It's kind of a messy <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mark</span>ing process, but it gets the job done.
* Imagine breaking and bending a comb so you can use it to stamp your seal onto things.
* You need this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seal</span> to stay at an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inn</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いん](https://jisho.org/search/いん)</span>). All inns require official paperwork, so you had to improvise and make a seal on the fly.
* Hopefully the inn accepts this seal... or you aren't going to have a place to sleep tonight. And it kind of just looks like you dipped a comb in ink and pressed it around on some paper.
