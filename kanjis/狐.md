## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> animal</span> that hangs out in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> melon</span> patches is the elusive <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fox</span>! They like to steal melons then come back into town disguised as human melon sellers. Foxes are tricky like that.
* Imagine seeing a red fox scampering through a melon patch trying to take melons with it.
* If you want to stop <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fox</span>es from stealing your melons you can get one of those <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kits</span> that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neigh</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きつね](https://jisho.org/search/きつね)</span>) when one is around. The kits neigh when they sense a fox, but because it sounds like a horse the fox won't run. But you'll be able to get out there and take your melons back!
* Imagine buying kits that neigh and putting them around your melon patch to warn you when foxes are around.
