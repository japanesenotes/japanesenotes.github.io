## Mnemonics
 * If you are <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> anti</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> one sided</span> paper you should bind them all up into an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> edition</span>.
* One sided paper is just anti everything. It's bad for the environment. It's bad for easy reading. Put all those one sided papers together into one, big edition instead.
* The first <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> edition</span> you create is a fan fiction all about the adventures of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Han</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はん](https://jisho.org/search/はん)</span>) Solo. You hated how short and one sided his story in Star Wars seemed to be, and trying to keep track of it all was really hard. But not anymore!
* Please read my super special Han Solo edition of the Star Wars story. I ripped out all the one sided pages that had him in it and put them into a single edition together so it's just the good stuff now.
