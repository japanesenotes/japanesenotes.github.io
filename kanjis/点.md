## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fortune</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> boil</span>s down to a single <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> point</span> in time. One <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> decimal point</span> in the math of time determines how the rest of your future will go.
* Imagine actually going somewhere to get your fortune told and watching a big boiling pot of goo. As it boils, it melts down to a single point at the very bottom. Where this point is determines your future.
* As you stare at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> decimal point</span> you watch in awe as it moves to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ten</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てん](https://jisho.org/search/てん)</span>) spot in a long series of numbers.
* Is the ten spot good? Are you going to live a long life or does this point mean you're only going to live ten more years?! Ahh!
