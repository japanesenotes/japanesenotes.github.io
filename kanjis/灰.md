## Mnemonics
 * On a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cliff</span>, a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fire</span> burns to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ashes</span>. The ashes then blow off the cliff, and follow the wind wherever it may go.
* See the light from the fire as the ashes fly off the cliff. The wind carries some of the ashes over to you. Feel the ashes as they strike your face and wipe the black ash with your hands.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ashes</span> inspire you to write a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hai</span>ku (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はい](https://jisho.org/search/はい)</span>). Using the ashes you write a haiku on a rock for everyone to enjoy.
* Ashes on my face. Falling from the cliff of fire. Gives my life meaning. Or just come up with your own haiku. Whatever works for you.
