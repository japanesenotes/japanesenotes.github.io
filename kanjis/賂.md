## Mnemonics
 * Someone is offering you a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> in exchange for a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> kiss</span>. This is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bribe</span>! You don't want to kiss them, but that shellfish sure looks tasty.
* Come on, don't you want this shellfish? they ask, shaking it up and down at you.
* You go through with the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bribe</span> and kiss the person, but then they snatch hold of the shellfish and run straight down the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ro</span>ad (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ろ](https://jisho.org/search/ろ)</span>). No!!
* This is why you never accept a bribe. One second you're staring a yummy shellfish in the face, and the next you're standing alone in the road feeling used.
