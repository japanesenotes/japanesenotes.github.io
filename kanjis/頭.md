## Mnemonics
 * If a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> geoduck</span> eats lots of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> beans</span>, its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> head</span> will grow larger. To a geoduck, beans are a brain food, so by eating beans, a geoduck’s head will grow incredibly large. Geoducks already look strange enough as it is, let alone with engorged heads.
* Imagine, if you will, a geoduck. Now imagine that same geoduck with a massive head. It looks ridiculous, and more disgusting than ever. It’s actually really creeping you out, because the head keeps getting larger as the geoduck eats more beans. Ew.
* As the geoduck eats more and more beans, its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> head</span> gets bigger and bigger until finally the geoduck’s head explodes like an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> atomi</span>c (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あたま](https://jisho.org/search/あたま)</span>) bomb. BOOM! Geoduck parts go flying everywhere and pieces of the geoduck’s massive head float to the ground as atomic fallout.
* Remember how gross geoducks are? Of course you do. Now imagine one exploding right in front of you. You’ve got geoduck mess all over yourself. It’s gross, slimy, sticky, and covering you from head to toe. It’s wretched.
