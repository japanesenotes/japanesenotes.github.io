## Mnemonics
 * You use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> to take down the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> old</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> install</span> a new one. Flags get old, just like computers and furniture and people. So when one gets too old, you have to get on up there and install a new on in its place.
* Imagine reaching out and grabbing onto the old flag with your fingers. Feel the dirty grime and little holes it's gotten. Now install something new!
* You've decided to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> install</span> a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> su</span>it (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span>) where the old flag used to be. I mean, a suit is probably more durable than a flag, am I right? This way you won't have to install flags as often.
* Picture a newly installed suit flying in the air on a pole.
