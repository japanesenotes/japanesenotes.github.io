## Mnemonics
 * You're holding a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span> on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stick</span> above your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eye</span>s to imitate <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eyebrows</span>. You can't grow any of your own, but you really love eyebrows, so this was the best you could do.
* Look at yourself in the mirror. You can see the stick holding up the flag and it's very clear you drew some eyebrows onto the flag with some markers, but you still look pretty good (in your opinion).
* Underneath your fake <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eyebrows</span> are two slabs of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> me</span>at (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [み](https://jisho.org/search/み)</span>). Meat helps hair grow, according to many Internet specialists who also happen to sell meat. You're waiting for this meat to foster eyebrow hair, and when that sweet day comes you won't need these flags.
* Imagine walking around town, holding your eyebrow flags. You can feel the meat sticking above your eyes. They stink and they're weirdly lukewarm, but you know your real eyebrows will grow under them any day now.
