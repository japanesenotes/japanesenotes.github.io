## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Eat</span>ing on this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bear</span>, which is how you know this is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> public building</span>. The law says that all bears are allowed to eat on the roofs of public buildings. In Japan at least, I don't know where bears are supposed to eat in wherever you're from.
* Picture a public building, like a museum or a library, and look at the roof. There's a bear eating up there! And it's smiling and waving to you!
* All <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> public building</span>s must serve bear needs thanks to the monumental law passed by Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>). Genghis Khan knew that bears weren't treated well by humans, so he made sure all public buildings were at least partially bear accessible.
* The next time you see a public building, think, Thank you Genghis Khan. Because of him bears are free to go up to the roof and eat whatever they please whenever they please.
