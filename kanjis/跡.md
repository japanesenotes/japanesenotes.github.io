## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> foot</span> is a little <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> red</span> and you can see <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> traces</span> of ink streaked on it. Where did these traces come from?
* You look closer at your foot, examining the traces of red ink, and slowly the night before comes back to you.
* Turns out the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> traces</span> of red ink were from a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sexy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せき](https://jisho.org/search/せき)</span>) rave you were at last night. Everyone around you looked so sexy, with their glow-in-the-dark paint, so you decided to put some of the red ink on your feet so everyone could see your sexy dancing.
* As you feel the sexy, confident feelings return, you see traces of the ink on your carpet, all the way from the door to the bed. Dang it.
