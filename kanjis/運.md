## Mnemonics
 * When you ride your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span>, your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> forehead</span> sticks out of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> car</span>, so you have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> carry</span> it. The scooter doesn't fit in the car when you aren't on it though, so you have to carry it out the window. And it takes a lot of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> luck</span> not to get clipped by a car or accidentally take out a pedestrian with it.
* Imagine trying to carry your scooter out the window. Your forehead is still sticking out of the car as you do this.
* As you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> carry</span> the scooter, your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> luck</span> turns, and it starts to rain, so you pull out your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> um</span>brella (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うん](https://jisho.org/search/うん)</span>). Now you're holding your scooter, your forehead, and an umbrella outside of the car.
* It's hard enough to carry a scooter while you drive, but now you have to try to keep yourself and it dry with an umbrella too.
