## Mnemonics
 * INSPECTor gadged wears a TOP-HAT with a TREE on.<br><br><br>If a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> is growing out of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> top hat</span> you need to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inspect</span> it to find out why and how this happened. You should probably <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> investigate</span> the area too. I mean, how could a tree grow out of a top hat anyway? Seems suspicious.
* Inspect the tree. Inspect the top hat. Did you find anything?
* In the middle of your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inspection</span> you realize you need to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> saw</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)</span>) the tree open to come to a good conclusion. This seems a bit unnecessary, but no! No! For the sake of this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> investigation</span> you must saw the tree in half!
* Imagine stopping to inspect the tree after each minute of sawing. You'll find out why it's growing out of a top hat! Eventually!
