## Mnemonics
 * You hide <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> poop</span> in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cape</span> as part of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> illusion</span> in your magic show. Your acts are kind of gross and this one involves creating the illusion of disappearing poop by hiding it within the folds of your cape.
* Imagine having poop in your cape. It would smell bad and anyone close to you would be able to smell right through the illusion.
* Somehow the poop cape <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> illusion</span> goes over really well. The crowd is giving you a standing ovation and right in the center is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Gen</span>ji (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [げん](https://jisho.org/search/げん)</span>). He marches up to you, wipes a tear from his eye, and says, Your illusion cape is wonderful. I must have it!
* Genji grabs the cape before you can stop him and he puts it on. You can see the illusion fade, he keeps smiling but more tears start streaming down his face. A wonderful illusion, the best I've ever seen, he chokes out and marches away, without looking back.
