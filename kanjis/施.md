## Mnemonics
 * Moving in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> direction</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gun</span>, an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> alligator</span> can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> carry out</span> a murder once it reaches it. This alligator wants to kill someone. The alligator wants to carry out their execution.
* See the alligator swim really slowly in the direction of a gun. See the alligator as it prepares to carry out the murder. It’s scary.
* In order to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> carry out</span> this murder, the alligator has to sneak up on its prey, so it can shoot it. You look across the water and see a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>) grazing by the shore. The alligator is going to carry out a murder on that sheep!
* Watch as the alligator slinks under the water, holding the gun above the water. When it gets close enough, it carries out the murder on the sheep. Shooting it right in the chest. Now it can eat the sheep without worrying about needing to chomp on it.
