## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> under which the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> can house one <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hundred</span> of his people is at the local <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lodge</span>.
* Back in the old days a lodge had to be huuuuge so when a leader brought a hundred people through town they'd have a place to stay. 
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lodge</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shook</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅく](https://jisho.org/search/しゅく)</span>) as the hundred people came tumbling in through the door. It shook, but it didn't fall over. The roof stayed firmly in place, and everyone got to sleep under it okay.
* Imagine being someone staying at the lodge as they came in and everything shook around you. This lodge would probably last through an earthquake too!
