## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> is next to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span>. What is he doing? He's leaning against it, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rest</span>ing.
* The best thing to do with a tree is rest under it. Picture the leader resting under the tree with his eyes half closed.
* As he <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rest</span>s, he suddenly gets hungry and pulls a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cu</span>cumber (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きゅう](https://jisho.org/search/きゅう)</span>) off the tree and bites into it. A good rest isn't complete without some crunchy tree cucumbers.
* Don't email me saying cucumbers don't grow on trees. Cucumber trees exist. Look them up and then rest easy knowing I'd never lie to you.
