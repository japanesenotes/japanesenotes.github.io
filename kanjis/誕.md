## Mnemonics
 * They SAY YOGA girls know how to give BIRTH the CORRECT way, standing in the downward facing dog pose.<br><br>They <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> yoga</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> correct</span> way to go through <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> birth</span>. Birth isn't easy, but people keep telling you that yoga is the right way to prepare and actually do it.
* Picture multiple people you know saying you should do yoga if you plan to give birth. It isn't a question of whether you want to, it's the correct way to do it. So you should.
* To prepare for giving <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> birth</span> you end up doing so much yoga outside that you get a really deep <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たん](https://jisho.org/search/たん)</span>).
* Hopefully having a tan doesn't make birth harder, since you've worked so hard to do this the correct way with so much yoga.
