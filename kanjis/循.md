## Mnemonics
 * If you want to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> loiter</span> on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cliff</span> with the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> pope</span> you better be ready to move in perfect <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> circulation</span> with him. The pope is wearing really heavy robes and it's hot up here on this cliff, so you both need to walk in circles to keep cool.
* Imagine this strange circulation of you and the pope up here on a cliff. It's not even like you two are up here for a reason, you're just loitering. But he doesn't want to be hot so he makes you circulate with him.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> circulation</span> wouldn't have to even be happening if it wasn't <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> June</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゅん](https://jisho.org/search/じゅん)</span>). The cliffs are so hot in June, and in any other month the two of you would have just sat down and had a chat. But in June you have to do this weird circulation dance.
* This circulation is all June's fault, you mutter, walking in a circle with the pope to stay cool.
