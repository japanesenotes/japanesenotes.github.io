## Mnemonics
 * You need to throw your two <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> wolverine</span>s and your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> into the oncoming <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> if you want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wash</span> them at the same time. It's the only way you can get them clean at once without the wolverines fighting over the turkey and somebody getting hurt. The tsunami is big enough to wash them all before anything bad happens.
* Imagine the tsunami coming toward you. Two wolverines in one hand and a turkey in the other. You're gonna wash them so good they'll never get dirty again.
* Once they're nice and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wash</span>ed you need to subdue them by poking each of them with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tack</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たく](https://jisho.org/search/たく)</span>). The tack has special sleeping medicine on it, so once they're nice and clean you can put them back in their cages without them trying to eat each other.
* If you want to wash your animals make sure to have your special tack ready. The tsunami will recede pretty fast so get it out!
