## Mnemonics
 * You take out a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span>, lay a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> towel</span> below it, and use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span> to carve the pattern through them both. Voila! This is exactly how old <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> printing</span> presses used to work.
* The old way of printing involved taking the pattern you want (the flag) pressing it against the place you want to print it (the towel) and then just slicing that sucker on there (with the knife).
* As you're working on <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> printing</span> your own flag onto this towel you look over and see someone else just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sat</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さつ](https://jisho.org/search/さつ)</span>) down on theirs. Excuse me, where is your knife? you ask. Oh, this way is slower, but it's less work. I'm just pressing them together with my bum.
* I guess if you wanted to be slow you could do your printing if you sat down on it too...
