## Mnemonics
 * Sticking a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> into a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span> to get its <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> measurement</span>s is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> specialty</span>. Most people get really confused when they have to measure their rice paddies, but that's where you come in. You plant a cross right in the middle, look down it from one end to the other, and voila! You know the measurements immediately. That's why it's your specialty!
* Visualize yourself doing this. The numbers just come to you. It's just what you're good at. Your specialty is something no one else in the world is as good at as you!
* Hearing of your amazing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> specialty</span> and cross measurement abilities, a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cen</span>taur (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span>) from a far off land recruits you for a job. The centaur’s father has just passed away and the centaur wants you to measure the rice paddies that have been left to him.
* Picture yourself at a centaur funeral. Tons of centaurs standing around and stamping their hooves as you make your measurement and stick a cross into the ground.
