## Mnemonics
 * If you figure out how to use a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> as a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> weapon</span>, everyone is going to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> die</span>. You can't control a tsunami, you fool. Now you've doomed us all.
* Picture everyone in the world being swept away in a tsunami to die. This is what happens when you try to use nature as a weapon.
* The only way to maybe not <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> die</span> is to find <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boats</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼつ](https://jisho.org/search/ぼつ)</span>). As long as the boats don't get smashed by the tsunami, you might be able to cheat death by holding onto the boats and not drowning.
* You don't want to die, do you? Get to the boats!
