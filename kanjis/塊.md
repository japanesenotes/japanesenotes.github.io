* Have you ever heard of the game Katamari Damacy? That game is about a little guy who rolls a ball around, turning it into a bigger and bigger <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lump</span>. What do you think the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Katamari</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かたまり](https://jisho.org/search/かたまり)</span>) part means? It means lump, of course.
