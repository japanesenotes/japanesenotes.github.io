## Mnemonics
 * How many <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span>s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> have</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span>s? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> All</span> of them!
* All buildings have at least one scooter. It could be out front, on the roof, in the basement. But all of them have scooters and someone who likes to ride them instead of using a car or a bike.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> All</span> of these scooters have a specific sound they make as they burst out of the buildings: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> zuwee</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ずい](https://jisho.org/search/ずい)</span>).
* Imagine the sound of the scooter's tiny engine: zuwee zuwee zu zu zuwee. All of them do this, which is why you hate them.
