## Mnemonics
 * Bite a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span>'s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> root</span> with your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fang</span> to get an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> approximation</span> on its age. It won't be exact, this isn't scientific or anything, but it will be pretty close.
* Once you have an approximation on the age, you'll be able to come up with an approximation on how much it's worth too.
* As you're recording your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> approximation</span> down,  somebody comes up and shouts, “Hey <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> guy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がい](https://jisho.org/search/がい)</span>)! I’ll give you $10,000 for that tree there, guy!” This guy must be crazy. That’s much more than your approximation of the value of this thing. But you sell it to the guy anyway.
* The guy is trying to look at your approximation now, while calling YOU guy over and over, and you just want him to buy it and leave you alone!
