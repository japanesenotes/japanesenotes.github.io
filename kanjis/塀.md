## Mnemonics
 * In the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> there are <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span>s and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span> lined up with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lantern</span> attached to them, making a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fence</span>. It's a little weird looking, but these things are definitely supposed to fence something in.
* Can you see the fence made of horns and flags through the light of the lantern?
* You want to know what this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fence</span> is fencing in, so you take a step closer. As the light from the lantern gets brighter you see that the fence is around a ton of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hay</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [へい](https://jisho.org/search/へい)</span>).
* Picture yourself climbing over this fence (that you're definitely not supposed to climb based on all these flags and horns) and falling into the piles of hay. It's a little scratchy, but otherwise pretty comfy!
