## Mnemonics
 * In <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span>, <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> head in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> direction</span> of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> and become a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> luxury</span>. Luxuries are things that are hard to get, which is why rich people like them so much. It shows they have the money and means to get things other people can't. So when these shellfish try to bury themselves deep, deep in the dirt in winter, they become the biggest luxury of them all.
* Imagine if you could get your hand on this type of luxury. Ah, that would be the life!
* You have your eyes on one of these <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> luxury</span> shellfish, and you're digging down into the cold dirt, when your fingers wrap around something hard and... long? You struggle to pull it out, but once you do, you realize you're holding a rare German saber: the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> zei</span>ber (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぜい](https://jisho.org/search/ぜい)</span>)!
* There's no luxury in the world as luxurious as this zeiber. You forget all about the shellfish and skip home with the zeiber instead.
