## Mnemonics
 * If you want to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> something at a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ceremony</span> for <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> construction</span> workers you're going to have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> try</span> really hard. Construction is loud, so if you want to be heard you have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attempt</span> to be louder than the drilling and smashing and digging and handing out of awards.
* Try to imagine trying this hard to be heard. The construction workers are all screaming at each other with ease. It's so hard for you to try and keep up with their volume!
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> try</span> to get their attention the only way you know how, by lifting a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>) above your head. The sheep baas and suddenly everything is silent, all eyes are on you. Well, they're on the sheep.
* Huh. You should have thought to try this sheep technique earlier.
