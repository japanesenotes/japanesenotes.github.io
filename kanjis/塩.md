## Mnemonics
 * You need to use your WEAPON to shoot people in the face in order to win the war. Which war? The SALT war. Once the world ended, salt became the most scarce resource and humans are now fighting each other to access SALT.<br><br>There is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> plate</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gun</span> on it. You decide to put it in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span>, but it's very bland, so you add some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> salt</span>. Salt will make anything tastier.
* Imagine putting a gun you found on a plate on the ground in your mouth to eat it. Are you crazy? Don't eat unseasoned food. Put some salt on that first.
* As you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> salt</span> this strange choice in food you mutter, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> She owe</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しお](https://jisho.org/search/しお)</span>) me for this, out loud to yourself. Who is she, you ask? The lady that put this salt-less food gun down in front of you before running away.
* She owes you for eating this. Next time she serves you a food sword or a food bow, she better season it properly first!
