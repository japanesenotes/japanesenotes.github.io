## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> blood</span> radical and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blood</span> are the same in looks as well as in meaning.
* There'll be some bad blood between us if you're not studying your radicals, especially when they're the same like this kanji!
* To remember the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けつ](https://jisho.org/search/けつ)</span>, we use the word ketsup. The perfect mix of ketchup and catsup!<br />The radical is technically <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> blood</span>, but you know that radical is just a drop (of blood) on a plate. So, you ask yourself... Is that really blood on the plate? Could it be? You decide to take a gamble and lick it off. When you taste it, it's definitely not blood. No, it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ketsup</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けつ](https://jisho.org/search/けつ)</span>).
* Feel the relief that you didn't just lick up someone's blood. Taste the ketsup taste, too. It's pretty good. Not quite ketchup, but not quite catsup. Yum!
