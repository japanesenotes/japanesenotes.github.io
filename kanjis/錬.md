## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gold</span> from the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> east</span> needs <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tempering</span> before it can be sold. The gold from the east is good, it just needs some tempering before it’s entirely presentable. You know, tempering like you’d do in a forge.
* Imagine tempering this gold from the east. You’re heat treating the gold when you’re tempering it, so feel the heat from the fire on your face and arms.
* The smithy where you’re doing the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tempering</span> is pretty fancy, but it’s just a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ren</span>tal (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れん](https://jisho.org/search/れん)</span>). You haven’t sold enough gold to own a smithy as nice as this one yet, so for now, you rent one. It is pretty swanky though, even for a rental.
* Imagine yourself in this rental smithy. It’s really nice. There’s like TVs and live music and free WiFi and everything. It’s a very nice rental in which to do tempering. Also keep in mind that this kanji shares its reading with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [練](https://jisho.org/search/練)</span>, which has the same right side.
