## Mnemonics
 * You put a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stone</span> into a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> wrap</span> of some kind. This wrap happens to be a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cannon</span>, and you're shooting off the stone, just like I used to do to boats with the cannon we had growing up for some reason.
* This makes a lot of sense when you think about it, right? The muzzle of the cannon wraps around the rock, then you shoot the rock. Boom!
* You aim the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cannon</span> at your own <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ho</span>me (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほう](https://jisho.org/search/ほう)</span>). You don't want to have a home anymore, you want to become a pirate, live on a boat, and (of course) shoot cannons all day long.
* Watch as the cannon goes off, the rock hurtles into your home. And just like that, there is a huge, rock-shaped hole in it. You'll have to shoot a few more rocks at your home with this cannon before it's completely gone.
