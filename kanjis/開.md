## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gate</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lantern</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> open</span> for you. That's convenient, since it's pretty dark out and you might not have seen the open gate without the lantern's help.
* Imagine being a traveler, walking around the outside of a huge walled city. You really need to get inside but all of the gates are closed. Finally, you see a single, bright lantern marking the open gate! What a relief.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> open</span> gate is in the water though, so you'll need a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ka</span>yak (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かい](https://jisho.org/search/かい)</span>) to get in. Luckily, you've been carrying your kayak with you just in case.
* Imagine kayaking in the dark toward an open gate. Finally, you've made it!
