## Mnemonics
 * There's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span> standing in the way of the next <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> chapter</span> in your life, and it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hinder</span>ing you. It's not like you couldn't find another way around, but it's definitely inconvenient.
* Picture this huge, tall building standing directly in the way. You peer around the other side and there is a book floating in the air that says Chapter 5: Success and Happiness. Dang, you really want to get over there to that part of your life.
* Someone put this building here specifically to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hinder</span> you. They knew you were close to the next chapter of your life, and they wanted to hinder you really good. And there they are, sitting on a throne smirking. It's the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>).
* The Shougun wants to hinder you and your life. He wants you to have to work harder so you become better, faster, and stronger than anyone else. Hindering you is his way of making sure you don't take the easy way out in life.
