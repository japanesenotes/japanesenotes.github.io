## Mnemonics
 * I hope all you're doing in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bathtub</span> is taking a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bath</span>. I mean, you can do other things if you want I guess. But bathtubs were made just for baths!
* Picture yourself taking a bath in your bathtub. Relaxing!
* When do you miss taking a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bath</span> the most? When you're on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ro</span>ad (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ろ](https://jisho.org/search/ろ)</span>). Traveling is fun and all, but when you're stuck in a car, traveling down a dirt road for days, all you want to do is take a nice long bath.
* Imagine being stuck on the road all day for a week. Imagine how good a bath will feel when you finally get home. Nice and hot and relaxing. Mmmm...
