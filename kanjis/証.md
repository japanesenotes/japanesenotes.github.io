## Mnemonics
 * What I <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> correct</span> 100%! You may use it as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> evidence</span> in this murder case.
* You convince the officials questioning you that your evidence can be trusted and it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> proof</span> that you definitely didn't have anything to do with any law breaking or murdering.
* The officials force you to present this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> evidence</span> in front of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>), himself. Your knees quake, you feel like you're gonna be sick, but you try to stand up tall and tell him everything. After all, you know your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> proof</span> is correct, so you shouldn't be so scared.
* You better hope the Shougun believes your evidence is accurate, because he's known to kill people willy-nilly when he thinks they're lying.
