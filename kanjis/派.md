 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> is coming for the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cliff</span> made of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tofu</span>, but there is a special <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sect</span> that protects tofu cliff.
* This sect of the tofu-lovers club takes their duties very seriously and they must protect this tofu cliff at all costs.
* All of the members of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sect</span> are standing on the cliff, their hands raised, and right as the tsunami is about to collide with them, they shout, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ha</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span>)! and it's repelled! The tsunami sinks and rolls back out to sea, the tofu cliff is safe!
* Oh, do you want to be a member of the tofu sect? HA! Don't make me laugh. If you ask to be a member of a sect, you'll never get in.<br />Never ask for a sect.
