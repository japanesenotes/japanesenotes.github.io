## Mnemonics
 * An <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> animal</span> eats a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> child</span> from a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> plate</span> in a very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fierce</span> manner. This is a fierce animal, so it makes sense that it would eat the child in a fierce style.
* See the fierce animal fiercely eating the child from the plate. It’s very gruesome. See blood and body parts flying everywhere as the animal devours the child.
* The reason this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fierce</span> animal is eating the child from the plate is because the child forgot to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mow</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もう](https://jisho.org/search/もう)</span>) the animal’s lawn. The fierce animal had hired the child to mow his lawn today, and when the child forgot to do it, the fierce animal hunted the child down and ate him.
* That child really shouldn’t have forgotten to mow the lawn. Imagine you are the child, being eaten by the fierce animal and wishing that you would have just mowed the lawn like you said you would.
