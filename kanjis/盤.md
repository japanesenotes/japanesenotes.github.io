## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> boat</span> holds your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> weapon</span> like a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> plate</span>. So in a way, it's just a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tray</span> for your weapon.
* A big boat shaped like a plate is just a tray. You keep your weapons on it, nice and flat.
* Unfortunately, this boat <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tray</span> is so big and flat that it keeps reflecting the light into your eyes, so you have to put on a pair of big Ray-<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ban</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばん](https://jisho.org/search/ばん)</span>) sunglasses.
* Picture yourself wearing your Ray-Bans as you look at your tray boat. The steel of your weapons reflect a lot of light into your eyes too. That's why you're wearing Ray-Bans.
