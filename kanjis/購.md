## Mnemonics
 * Picture <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lifeguard</span>. They're not going anywhere. First, they're a shellfish, so they can't really move. And, they're a lifeguard, so they need to be in their lifeguard tower. How does this shellfish lifeguard get stuff? Through <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> subscription</span> services.
* See a bunch of subscription boxes around the lifeguard tower. It gets everything this way.
* The shellfish lifeguard's favorite <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> subscription</span> is its subscription to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span> magazine. It has all the latest <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち]([こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち)</span> versions, news, and interviews. 
* See the shellfish lifeguard drooling as its <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち]([こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち)</span> magazine subscription arrives. I will read this one now, but I can't wait until next month, it says as a boat sinks in the distance.<br />Hint: when you see the lifeguard radical, the reading is probably going to be <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)</span>.
