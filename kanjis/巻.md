## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gladiator</span> only sees himself (<span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> oneself</span>) on those big <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scroll</span>s they advertise the fights with. Gladiators don't get mirrors and there are no cameras or videos yet. The scroll drawings are all they get of themselves.
* Imagine being a gladiator. Your big fight is coming and you're the  main event! Look at the scroll for the fight and try to find yourself.
* When you look at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scroll</span> you realize... you look just like Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>)! You excitedly fist pump and start showing everyone how cool you are.
* After a while of showing off the scroll, someone finally pulls you aside and says, That guy isn't you, it's the real Genghis Khan. He's coming to the event and he's against you. So. Nice knowing you.<br />Oh.
