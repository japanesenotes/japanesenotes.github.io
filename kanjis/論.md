All this reading and thinking has finally given you a wonderful idea, a theory you think might solve all of your problems!

* What is your theory, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ron</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ろん](https://jisho.org/search/ろん)</span>)? asks Hermione. You're Ron Weasley, and you just came up with a theory that you think will help you stop Voldemort.
* Ron? Ron, what's your theory? What's your theory, Ron? Hermione asks over and over. But you freeze. You don't remember who you are. Hermione, I have a theory that I was just a person learning Japanese, and not a magical boy at all. Shut up Ron, that's a stupid theory, she replies.
