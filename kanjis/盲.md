## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> death</span> of your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eye</span>s means that you've gone <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blind</span>.
* Imagine what it would be like to have one of your eyes die. You'll be blind in that eye forever!
* When you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blind</span> you probably shouldn't drive anymore because if you do you'll <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mow</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もう](https://jisho.org/search/もう)</span>) everyone over. Actually, don't mow your lawn either. Blind people probably shouldn't be driving anything.
* Imagine a blind person mowing over everyone in their car as they drive on the sidewalk. Eeek. At least they don't have to see this mess.
