## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Criminal</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> writing</span> is always <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> patterned</span>. That is to say, there is a pattern to it, lots of ARGS and GONNA STAB YAs, but it's also patterned beautifully, with a collage of cut out letters.
* Can you see the patterns in the writing this criminal did? It looks like a quilt or some plaid. It's almost beautiful, the way those death threats are arranged!
* As you look closer at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> patterned</span> writing you realize that it forms the shape of an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eagle</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>). The most American bird of them all! Maybe this guy isn't a criminal after all!
* Picture an eagle patterned out of cut out letters. What the words say isn't important (though it is asking for a ransom on your grandma), but the underlying image is gorgeous.
