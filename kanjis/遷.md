## Mnemonics
 * Going from a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> helicopter</span> that's <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> big</span> even for yourself (<span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> oneself</span>), is huge <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> transition</span>.
* It's an upward transition, so that's nice, but it's still going to take you a long time to get used to using a big helicopter instead of a scooter.
* You decide one <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> transition</span> isn't enough, so you transition to a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cen</span>taur (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span>) too. Now you're a big half horse-half human creature and you'll fit in the big helicopter better.
* A centaur is just a human halfway between transitioning into a horse, so it isn't even that hard to do!
