## Mnemonics
 * You have two <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bow</span>s but they're both covered in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ice</span>. This has made them very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> weak</span>.
* Just look at these weak, iced over bows. If you tried to draw back their strings they'd snap into a million pieces.
* You give up on your trip and bring the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> weak</span> bows back to your car, but it's stuck in the ice and snow. You decide to use the bows as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> jack</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゃく](https://jisho.org/search/じゃく)</span>) to try to get your car unstuck. Unfortunately, they're just too weak and they break in half.
* Now you're stuck with two weak broken bows and no jack. Ice is lame.
