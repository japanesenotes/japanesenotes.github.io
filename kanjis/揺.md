## Mnemonics
 * You grab a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> satellite</span> with your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shake</span> it! You're an astronaut and it's your job. Don't worry, the satellite won't break or anything, it's strong for space travel. Just do as you're told and shake the sucker.
* Imagine being in space and shaking a satellite with your fingers.
* You need to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shake</span> it because this satellite is full of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>gurt (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よう](https://jisho.org/search/よう)</span>). And you only like yogurt that's been well shook. And who can resist space yogurt? Huh? Anyone?
