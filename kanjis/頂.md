## Mnemonics
 * Take the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> street</span> all the way to that <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> geoduck</span>, way up there. When you reach it, you will have made it to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> summit</span>. You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> humbly</span> present the road to the geoduck and bow before it.
* There is a giant geoduck at the summit of the mountain, and the street will lead you right there. Imagine the grueling climb up the mountain to the summit. Feel it in your legs, and keep looking at that tall, tall geoduck. Now imagine kneeling those same aching legs humbly to the street below the geoduck.
* You are at the top, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> summit</span> of everything! You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> humbly</span> survey your surroundings from the top of the geoduck, only to see someone on the street, running toward you. It is Mrs. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chou</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょう](https://jisho.org/search/ちょう)</span>), and she looks angry.
* Anytime you use the street, you're in Mrs. Chou's territory. After detecting you were using her street to reach the geoduck, she started coming after you. Remember, wherever there's a street (radical), Mrs. Chou is not far behind.
