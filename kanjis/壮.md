## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> samurai</span> who can fight with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> icicle</span>s on him is more <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> robust</span> than regular samurai. Can you imagine how robust you'd have to be to fight in weather cold enough to form icicles on your body?
* Picture samurai standing in a line. One, two, three... woah. You look up. This guy has icicles growing off him and he's the size of a bus. Now that's a robust samurai.
* You may think it's just his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> robust</span> body, but it's actually the samurai's robust <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>) that keeps him fighting through the cold and the icicles.
* Physical robustness is just a reflection of the strength of your soul!
