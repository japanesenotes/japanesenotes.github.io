## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> restaurant</span> says, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Halt</span>! to everyone who wants to come in. The leader looks them up and down. Stares into their eyes. And then, maybe, they may go into the restaurant to eat.
* Imagine being told to halt in front of your favorite restaurant, then being turned away. Noooo! Better start sucking up to the restaurant leader.
* People only <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> halt</span> because they want this restaurant's world famous <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ta</span>ter (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てい](https://jisho.org/search/てい)</span>) tots. Which is probably why there is a leader out front making sure only people who can really appreciate the tater tots can get in to eat them.
* HALT! NO TATERS FOR YOU!
