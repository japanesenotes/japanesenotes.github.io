I mean, probably. There's a 99% chance you'll die.
* Picture someone else riding a scooter with an axe in their fingertips. That's so dangerous! One bump, one bad turn, and that axe slips and they'll die.
* You slip. The axe collides with your face. You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> die</span>. But... wait! There's a bright, blue glow and suddenly you're un-dead. You watch in slow motion as your holy blue <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sa</span>ber (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せい](https://jisho.org/search/せい)</span>) brings you back to life and takes the hit from the axe instead.<br />Wait, no!<br />It shatters.
* Your holy blue saber died for you. It saved you from certain death and now it died. After all you've been through together. All 60 levels. This is the end.
