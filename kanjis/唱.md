 * It's time to do the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chant</span>. That's when you use your mouth to chant sun sun, sun sun, sun sun, over and over until the sun appears.
* Open your mouth and practice the chant right now! Sun sun, sun sun, sun sun!
* You're doing this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chant</span> because the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>) ordered you to. The sun hasn't been shining on him as much lately, and he's displeased. So now you have to chant for him.
* The Shougun is glaring intently at you as you chant. Open your mouth as wide as you can, get all those sun suns out, and pray that the sun will appear.
