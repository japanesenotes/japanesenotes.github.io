## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ear</span> listens to your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span> and feels <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shame</span>. Your heart is full of shame for how you’ve lived your life and when your ear hears all the things you’ve done, your ear feels shame too.
* Feel the shame. Feel the shame in both your ear and your heart. Imagine the things you’ve done to make you feel so much shame.
* You must cleanse your spirit of this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shame</span>. You decide to complete <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Haj</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はじ]([は](https://jisho.org/search/は)じ)</span>). (Haj is the fifth pillar of Islam, and is a pilgrimage to Mecca during the month of Dhu al-Hijja). Upon arrival in Mecca, you think of a funny joke and bust out laughing. “<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> HA</span>HAHAHAHAHA!! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span>) HAHAHAHAHA!!!” Oh man, you’re in a temple and that was completely inappropriate. You feel even more shame than before.
* You’re super embarrassed for bringing so much shame on yourself again. But then you think of another joke. “Hahaha!” Better luck with the next Haj, I guess.
