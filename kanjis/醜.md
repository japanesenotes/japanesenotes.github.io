## Mnemonics
 * Give <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> alcohol</span> to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> demon</span> and you'll see how <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ugly</span> it really is. Demons need to concentrate to keep their disguises going. Even if it looked pretty when you met it, like super handsome, give it a few drinks and its facade will slide off and reveal its super gross demon face.
* Picture the drunk demon as its pretty face drips off revealing the ugly crap piled underneath.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ugly</span> demon is drunk and taking off his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shoe</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅう](https://jisho.org/search/しゅう)</span>) and swinging them around his head. And, oh no, he's drinking more alcohol out of the shoes.
* The demon drinking alcohol out of its nasty shoes is the ugliest scene you've ever seen.
