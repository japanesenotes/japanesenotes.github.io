## Mnemonics
 * The radical <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fish</span> and the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fish</span> are exactly the same!
* Nothing fishy about that, right?
* You catch a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fish</span>. As you pull it out of the water, it starts yelling and pointing: GO! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎょ](https://jisho.org/search/ぎょ)</span>). GO GYO GYO GYO! There's a huge cruise ship coming right towards your little fishing boat. No wonder the fish was yelling GO at you.
* Have him continue to scream GO GYO GYO GYO! as you try to get your engine started and attempt to flee your impending doom. The fish helps too, because he's pretty worried as well.
