## Mnemonics
 * You take a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lid</span>, and aiming it at the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> kick</span> it into the air and eventually it begins to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> decline</span> and crashes into the sun, causing it to supernova. Imagine kicking this lid so hard that it flies into space. See it fly up to the peak of its arch, then watch as it begins the decline until it finally collides with the sun.
* As you watch the lid decline, keep in mind that the sun radical its middle line extending outside the box on both sides. This is because the sun is going supernova. Pew!
* As the lid begins to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> decline</span> in the sky, you realize what’s going to happen so you attempt to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> swi</span>ng (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すい](https://jisho.org/search/すい)</span>) to safety. Swing on some vines in the direction opposite of the sun. You know that once that lid finishes its decline and collides with the sun, there’s gonna be trouble.
* Imagine swinging on these vines as you hear the sun explode and go supernova behind you. Swing faster! Swing faster!
