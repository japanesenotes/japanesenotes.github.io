## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> request</span>s a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sphere</span>! He didn't say what kind though, so you're going to have to figure it out and bring him the right kind of sphere.
* Imagine all the different spheres you know and bring them to the king one by one. He doesn't seem to like any of them... think of more spheres!
* You can't seem to find the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sphere</span> the king requested, so you take a break, sit down, and take out your lunch. THAT! the king screams, THAT IS THE SPHERE I REQUESTED! You look down and he's pointing to the cut up <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cu</span>cumbers (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きゅう](https://jisho.org/search/きゅう)</span>) in your salad.
* Cucumbers aren't really spheres... they're circles at best if you cut them, but you can't tell the king that. Just let him eat your cucumbers and think they're sphere-shaped. Maybe next time use a melon-baller and make your cucumbers into spheres for him.
