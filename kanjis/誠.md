## Mnemonics
 * Something you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> to someone you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> become</span> attached to should be said with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sincerity</span>. You need to speak with sincerity when you say things to someone who will eventually become your significant other, for example.
* Imagine saying something with sincerity to someone you want to become important to you. Say something like, “I love you” out loud. Say it with the utmost sincerity.
* When you say something with complete, unabashed <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sincerity</span> your special <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sa</span>ber (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せい](https://jisho.org/search/せい)</span>) starts to pulse with the beating of your heart. It shows the person you want to become close to that you truly are sincere!
* Say, I love you, again and watch your saber beating in time with your heart. If you weren't sincere it would fade and grow dull.
