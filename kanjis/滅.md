## Mnemonics
 * Hit by a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span> is propelled down a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span> where he hits the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> which is covered in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fire</span>. He is immediately <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> destroy</span>ed.
* Even if he wasn't saved by the slide (to avoid the tsunami) he would be in trouble. Seems like the world just wanted to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> destroy</span> this drunkard.
* One could say this drunkard <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> met</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [めつ](https://jisho.org/search/めつ)</span>) his fate. 
* Strangely, he just came from a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Mets</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [めつ](https://jisho.org/search/めつ)</span>) game, so maybe that's why he had such bad luck.
