## Mnemonics
 * Kill a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shrimp</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sickle</span> and you'll need a really good <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> explanation</span> for yourself. What did that shrimp do to you? Why use a sickle? Well? What's your explanation?
* Try to come with an explanation for picking up a sickle and cutting the head off a shrimp with it.
* In your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> explanation</span> you blame everything on <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shaq</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゃく](https://jisho.org/search/しゃく)</span>). He told you to do it! It's all Shaq's fault, you explain. 
* Picture Shaq popping into your head as you struggle to come up with an explanation for me. Picture Shaq's face. This is payback for Shaq Fu, you think, as you finalize the rest of the explanation in your mind.
