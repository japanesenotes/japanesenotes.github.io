## Mnemonics
 * At your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> wedding</span> you use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> catch</span> the wedding rings. And to catch the bouquet. And to catch the rice that everyone is throwing at you, ow, ow, hey stop! Weddings are really more about catching things than they are about whoever is standing across from you.
* Imagine being at a wedding and getting to catch a ton of things in your fingers.
* You're having a good time <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> catch</span>ing things until it's cleanup time and someone throws a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hoe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほ](https://jisho.org/search/ほ)</span>) at you. First of all, ow again, that was your face. Second, this is your wedding. You aren't supposed to have to hoe it all up. You're supposed to drop everything you caught and leave!
* Picture yourself grumpily hoeing all the things you couldn't catch, and the dirt under it, and putting it into a big dumpster.
