## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> color</span> radical and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> color</span> are the same in looks as well as in meaning.
* Color me pink! This kanji's super easy if you know your radicals.
* You already have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> color</span> on the mind because you know the meaning of this kanji, so think of something colorful about yourself. Imagine your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ear</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いろ](https://jisho.org/search/いろ)</span>) being a weird color... green, purple, red, whatever. Just make it really bright and standing out.
* You can even have someone ask you about your ear... Is your ear okay? I think it's the color blue...
