## Mnemonics
 * When the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> is over the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> it's time to go to church... which is so darn <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> early</span>. And if you want to get to church early, you need to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fast</span>, otherwise you'll be too late.
* Imagine the sun coming up slowly, over the horizon. It then lines up with the cross, and at that moment, your alarm goes off, waking you up. You check the alarm clock, and instead of displaying the time, it just says EARLY and FAST on it, flashing in big red letters and alternating.
* To remember the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span> reading we use the word soul.<br />When you're forced to get up <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fast</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> early</span> you can feel it in your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>). You're so tired and it's so early, your soul cries out, Please don't make me go this fast this early. I'm gonna leave your body if you keep this up!
* But you get your soul up early and head to the church fast anyway, because you're doing all of this for your soul in the first place!
