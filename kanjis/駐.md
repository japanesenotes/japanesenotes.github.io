## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horse</span> is your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> master</span> and you are merely a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> resident</span> in his house. How did this horse become your master? Those aren’t questions a resident should ask! Know your place, resident!
* Imagine having a horse as your master. Hear him neigh out orders to you and the other residents of the horse master’s house.
* To prove yourself a worthy <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> resident</span> of the horse master’s house, you must capture <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chew</span>bacca (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちゅう](https://jisho.org/search/ちゅう)</span>). Your horse master collects rare creatures, and Chewbacca is his latest desire. If you wish to remain a resident of the house, you must capture Chewbacca.
* Imagine Chewbacca in a cage in the horse master’s house. You’ve proved yourself a worthy resident. Hear Chewbacca making his Wookie sounds as he bashes against the bars of his new cage.
