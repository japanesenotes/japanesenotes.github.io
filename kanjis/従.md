## Mnemonics
 * If you see someone <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> loiter</span>ing around with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span> on their head you'd be <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> correct</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> obey</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accompany</span> them.
* First of all, this could be really fun. Second of all, if this person is a demon or something, you should really just obey them or they could curse you. What's the worst that could happen?!
* If you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> obey</span> the horned man you'll end up with a ton of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> jew</span>els (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゅう](https://jisho.org/search/じゅう)</span>)!
