## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bird</span> sits upon a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mountain</span>. If you look at the radicals, the bird is quite large and the mountain quite small. Think of this in the mnemonic as well. The reason the mountain is small is because you can only see the top of it, sticking out of the water. On it is the bird. This small mountain with the bird on it is an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> island</span>.
* Imagine the mountain as small as you'd like. Maybe it's only barely sticking out of the sea, and the bird is having trouble standing on it. Whatever you do, make sure you think of it as an island, possibly owned by the bird.
* But this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> island</span> doesn't only belong to the bird. In fact, the bird shouldn't be on this island, because it belongs to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> She-Ma</span>n (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しま](https://jisho.org/search/しま)</span>), He-Man's girlfriend. She-Man comes out of the water and grabs the bird, eats it, and then goes back into the sea from whence she came.
* I don't think She-Man is a real character, but you can make up this imaginary He-Man girlfriend in your mind. She is weird about her island, and weird about eating birds, but He-Man and She-Man are in love, so why are you judging? Imagine the two having dinner on their small island later that evening. He-Man wonders where she got the bird from.
