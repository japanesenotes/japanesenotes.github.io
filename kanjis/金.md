## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gold</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gold</span> kanji are the same!
* Just know your radicals and you'll be golden, so to speak.
* The most <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gold</span> in the land belongs to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kin</span>g (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きん](https://jisho.org/search/きん)</span>) of England. In fact, you've never actually met someone with gold, it all goes straight to the King whenever someone finds some. You just have a few pennies to work with.
* Picture the King on a huge pile of gold. Gold coins, gold candelabras, gold ponies. He's laughing and pointing at all of it while making very strong eye contact with you.
