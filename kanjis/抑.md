## Mnemonics
 * Use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cat pirate</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suppress</span> him. The cat pirate was attacking you, so you took your fingers and pet his head and scratched his chin. Now he's calm and suppressed. He doesn't even remember why he was attacking you.
* Imagine suppressing a cat pirate with your own fingers. His fur is so soft, but his nails are so sharp!
* He forgot, but you know you had to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suppress</span> the cat pirate because he was trying to steal your egg <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yolk</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よく](https://jisho.org/search/よく)</span>). You were making breakfast on your ship and the cat pirate boarded you out of nowhere, and tried to take it by force.
* Defend the yolk! Smell the smell of eggs in the air as you suppress the cat pirate. Maybe even share the yolk with him, once he's done trying to kill you for it. And then enjoy breakfast while petting your new cat friend.
