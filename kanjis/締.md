 * You have a special <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> towel</span> you can use to make it <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stand</span> up by <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tighten</span>ing it.
* Imagine pulling this thread and watch as your towel tightens and goes rigid, standing up almost completely on its own (except that the thread did it).

That way it stands up nice and straight next to your eating chair, ready for all that delicious tater tot grease that gets on your fingers.
* A tightened towel stands up for easy grease cleanup. No wiping on your pants, no dripping on the floor.
