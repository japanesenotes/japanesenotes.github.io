## Mnemonics
 * Look at the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> at <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dawn</span> and you'll be able to see all the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hedge</span>s growing in the area really well. At any other time of day, hedges tend to blend into their surroundings. But at dawn, the shadows the sun makes really helps them stand out.<br />This hedge also works as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fence</span>. It borders an area and you can't walk through it. A natural fence!
* Picture yourself leaning over a balcony at dawn, looking at all the hedges appear and their shadows stretch over the ground.
* You're looking intently at one particular <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hedge</span> because yesterday you dropped your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かき](https://jisho.org/search/かき)</span>) behind it. Now that you know where the hedge is you're going to need to search it to find your car keys.
* Imagine rooting around under some hedges, desperately trying to find your car keys. Hedges are prickly and there's spiders in here! If only you didn't need a car in the first place!
