## Mnemonics
 * Take your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dry</span> them. Then <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dry</span> them again. This is what you do when you are in  <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> worship</span>. Once you go into your place of worship, and again before you leave. You have really sweaty fingers, and you can't worship anyone or anything if you have wet hands. So you dry them!
* Picture your sweaty, sweaty fingers. Dry them off before you enter a place of worship! No god wants to deal with your weird, damp hands.
* Once you're dry and in wherever your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> worship</span> is, you begin with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hai</span>ku (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はい](https://jisho.org/search/はい)</span>). Really all places of worship have their own version of the haiku, and heck, the 5-7-5 rule is just a guideline, so everyone is doing it pretty close to right anyway.
* Imagine being in your place of worship. Close your eyes and say a haiku:<br />So I won't offend<br />Lord Crabigator-sama<br />I dry my hands now.
