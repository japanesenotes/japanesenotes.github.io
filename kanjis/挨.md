## Mnemonics
 * You use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> when you're in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> private</span> to use an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> arrow</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> push open</span> things.
* You're in private in your own room, no one else is around. Now you wrap your fingers around this big arrow, and you push open your door, your curtains, your windows. It's weird, but you really enjoy this.
* Your favorite thing to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> push open</span> is your own <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eye</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あい](https://jisho.org/search/あい)</span>). You take the arrow into your fingers and gently push each lid open until you can see.
* Picture the arrow in your hands. You're facing a mirror, but you can't see because you're about to push open your eyes. The anticipation is killing you, push them open now!
