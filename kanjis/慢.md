## Mnemonics
 * If your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> soul</span> is acting like the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> trapped in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> net</span> sitting on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span>, then people will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ridicule</span> you for your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> laziness</span>. You're just sitting there, trapped and not moving.
* Your soul just doesn't want to move or do anything though... and that may look like laziness, but you can't help it. You wish your friends and family wouldn't ridicule you. You're going through enough, internally.
* When people <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ridicule</span> you, when you can't stop the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> laziness</span>, you read <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> man</span>ga (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まん](https://jisho.org/search/まん)</span>). Manga helps you feel better about the mean things people say. Manga helps you feel like you're doing something, and that you aren't just a lazy person.
* Picture yourself reading manga and watch as the people who ridicule you and call you lazy fade away into the background. You're going to be okay.
