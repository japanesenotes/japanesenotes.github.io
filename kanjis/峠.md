## Mnemonics
 * If you look at what's <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> above</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> below</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mountain</span> you'll just see a bunch of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ridge</span>s. Mountains are made of ridges going up and down, that's why they're so pointy and so hard to climb.
* Imagine looking off the edge of a mountain at all the big ridges going above and below it.
* It's only on this type of mountain <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ridge</span> that you'll be able to find the rare and adorable <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> To</span>kyo <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ge</span>cko (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうげ](https://jisho.org/search/とうげ)</span>). These tiny little critters can only be found on the ridges going above and below the mountains in Tokyo. There are like six mountains in Tokyo, so the next time you're scaling the ridges keep your eyes open for the Tokyo gecko!
* Picture yourself sitting on a mountain ridge in Tokyo and watching a little Tokyo gecko run up and down on them. It's adorable and totally worth the climb.
