Your crew is so impressed by your leadership, and their lack of being very dead, and they all start laughing, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ha</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span>) ha ha ha! They thought they were going to die but you lead them to the moon safely!
* Imagine laughing along with the crew, in awe at your own leadership skills. Ha ha ha! We didn't die!
