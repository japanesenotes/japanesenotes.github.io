## Mnemonics
 * The radical for <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rain</span> and the kanji for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rain</span> are the same thing.
* Make sure you know your radicals!
* What if the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rain</span> actually tried to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> aim</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あめ](https://jisho.org/search/あめ)</span>) for you? As in, drops would move out of their normal flight path just to hit you on your head? You'd be a lot wetter, that's for sure.
* Imagine a world where each rain drop had to choose a target to aim for. How strange would rainfall be? Also, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あめ](https://jisho.org/search/あめ)</span> and aim don't really sound too much alike, but the goal is to use aim to get to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あめ](https://jisho.org/search/あめ)</span>, so make sure to take note of that in your mind as you learn the reading.
