* What do all <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> husband</span>s love? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Foo</span>d (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふう](https://jisho.org/search/ふう)</span>)! Can you hear your future husband? He’s saying,” Fooooood! FOOOOOD!” like some kind of food craving zombie.
