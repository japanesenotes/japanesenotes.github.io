## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> you use to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> go</span> from place to place is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> street</span>. Back in the old days, all roads were made of dirt, not like the newfangled roads of today.
* Imagine using a dirt street to go from one place to another.
* As you're walking down the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> street</span>, staring at the dirt, a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> guy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がい](https://jisho.org/search/がい)</span>) bumps into you, Hey guy, watch where you're going! As he says this he bumps into another guy. Watch it guy, I'm walkin' in this street! Woah guy, this isn't your business, this is my street!
* You walk away from the two guys yelling and head down a different street. You hope all streets aren't full of loud guys.
