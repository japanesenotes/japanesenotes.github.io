## Mnemonics
 * You use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stone</span> to begin <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cultivation</span> of the land. You use your fingers to till the soil, the stone to flatten the ground, and you carefully poke the seeds into the dirt and then use the stone to smash them further down.
* Imagine being in a field, using your fingers and a stone to cultivate the whole thing, by hand.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Cultivation</span> is suddenly halted because a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tack</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たく](https://jisho.org/search/たく)</span>) sticks into your finger. You pull the tack out, throw it away and start cultivation again when... ouch! There's another tack. This field is full of tacks!
* Now cultivation is going to involve getting all the tacks out of here, preferably with the stone and not your fingers, so they don't get stuck anymore.
