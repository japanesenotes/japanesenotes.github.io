## Mnemonics
 * You try to use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> to cast <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> doubt</span> on people by using them to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> imitate</span> each other. Right now you're using your fingers as finger puppets, imitating one of your friends to the others.
* Picture your angry friend standing up next to your fingers, shouting, I'm the real me! That's just an imitation! The rest of your friends look nervously at each other. They doubt this person is real now.
* Everyone thinks the friend you were trying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> imitate</span> is the imitation now and they have them in a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gui</span>llotine (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎ](https://jisho.org/search/ぎ)</span>). You even doubt if they're an imitation or if your fingers are the imitation.
* Okay, so that's a lie, Your fingers are definitely imitating them, but you don't want to end up in the guillotine so you keep your mouth shut.
