## Mnemonics
 * Someone with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> top hat</span> comes and tells you that your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grain</span>s are going to be taxed from now on. Top hat man says there is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tariff</span> that's been enacted on grains. Rice? Triple the price. Wheat? Quadruple.
* People in top hats like to put tariffs on lots of things. Especially things you need, like grains you eat to stay alive. You have no choice but to pay.
* You're listening to all the things in this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tariff</span> and you finally get fed up and ask what isn't being taxed now. The top hat man looks at you and smiles, holding out his hand. In his hand is some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soa</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そ](https://jisho.org/search/そ)</span>).
* Everything you get from other counties has been tariffed except for soap. You'll be hungry, but at least you'll be clean.
