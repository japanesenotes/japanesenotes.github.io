## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> rises over the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> capital</span> building, creating a breathtaking <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scene</span>. The sun is so bright and warm as it crests over the capital building. It’s quite the scene to behold.
* Picture this scene in your mind. Squint as the sun shines in your eyes and feel its warmth as it rises up and over the capital building.
* The only way to make this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scene</span> better would be to add <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>ke (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けい](https://jisho.org/search/けい)</span>). Now that you think about it... as you look at the scene in front of you, the capital kind of looks like a big cake.
* Picture this scene again, but this time the sun is making the capital look like a big, fancy cake. Now take a bite!
