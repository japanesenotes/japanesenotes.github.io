* Imagine yourself in the swamp when the tsunami hits. Feel the water crash into you along with the shrimp. You’re all wet and shrimpy now.
* Your house was right next to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> swamp</span> and on this side of your house you had many a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tack</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たく](https://jisho.org/search/たく)</span>) there to hang things on. Now, on every tack there is skewered a shrimp. The force of the tsunami drove them into the tacks on the side of your house.
* Look at the side of your house. It’s covered with shrimp that have been impaled on the tacks. Perfect for dinner.
