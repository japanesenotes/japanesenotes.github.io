## Mnemonics
 * You try to put your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> toe</span> inside a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span>, but it just won't open. That's because this shellfish has sworn an oath of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chastity</span>.
* No, I won't open up until I meet the toe I will marry, it says to you.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chastity</span> is really important to me, the shellfish says. But, maybe if you give me a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ta</span>ter (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てい](https://jisho.org/search/てい)</span>) tot, I'll change my mind.
* You give the shellfish a tater tot, and it breaks its vow of chastity, opening up for your toe. You look the other way, but you can hear the sounds of passion below.
