## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Rice paddy</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> power</span> comes from a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> man</span>. One man, in fact. He's running on a big wheel next to the rice paddy and providing all of the power for the rice to grow and be harvested.
* Picture the power this man is generating! Now look at the next rice paddy and you'll see it's on a different power grid with a different man powering it.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> man</span> can power an entire rice paddy until <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dawn</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だん](https://jisho.org/search/だん)</span>). Once dawn comes they need a little break, so they nap. But once dawn is over, they're back at it again!
* Picture the man watching as the first light of dawn tints the color of the sky, turning it pink and orange. He stops working, lays down, and falls asleep.
