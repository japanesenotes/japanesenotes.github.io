## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> with a lot of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> power</span> can move <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heavy</span> things with hardly any <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> work</span>. By power, I mean a lot of strength because this leader is very strong and moving heavy things is no problem for him. His power allows the leader to move heavy things with little to no work at all.
* Picture this powerful leader, bare chested with a crown on his head. His muscles are bulging as he picks up heavy things and casually tosses them aside. How does he maintain so many muscles?
* Where does this leader’s power come from? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Dou</span>ghnuts (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [どう](https://jisho.org/search/どう)</span>). He eats nothing but doughnuts. He has a special crew of bakers that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> work</span> for him in his castle and they work all day to make the leader doughnuts of power. They are imbued with many secret ingredients that give the leader the power to move anything, no matter how heavy it is.
* Picture yourself eating one of these power doughnuts. It’s delicious. Doughnuts are fantastic. Taste the fresh doughnut in your mouth as it crumbles and melts on your tongue. It’s the best doughnut you’ve ever had.
