## Mnemonics
 * If you see an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> animal</span> among the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span>, chances are it’s a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cat</span>. Cats love rice paddy flowers, almost as much as they love catnip.
* Picture this cat meowing and purring as it rubs up against all the flowers in the rice paddy field. Aww, it’s so cute!
* Wait a minute… This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cat</span> is pretty odd looking. You take a closer look, seeing it is missing its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neck</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ねこ](https://jisho.org/search/ねこ)</span>). You go to pet it, but it's super sensitive about that area of its head, which is basically a face connected to a body...
* Try not to imagine this too hard. It is disturbing.
