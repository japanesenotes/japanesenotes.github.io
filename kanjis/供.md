## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> is always <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> together</span> with their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> servant</span>. The servant is their constant <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> companion</span>, always following close behind the leader, offering them hot towels and bottled water.
* Try to picture the servant without the leader... you can't! The servant and the leader are always together.
* Once a year, when the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> servant</span> wants to go home to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> きょうと</span>, the leader follows. The servant isn't just there for the leader, they're companions, they support each other at all times. Even if that means heading home to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょうと](https://jisho.org/search/きょうと)</span> to see the fam.
* Picture the servant enjoying tea and cherry blossoms in <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょうと](https://jisho.org/search/きょうと)</span> with their family as the leader sits patiently off to the side. What a good relationship these two have!
