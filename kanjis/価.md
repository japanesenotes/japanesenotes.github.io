## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> helicopter</span> the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> is in has the most <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> value</span>! He would only choose to fly the very best one, after all. That's why it's worth way more than the others. Actually, any helicopter he flies goes up in value. That's the amazing effect of a good leader.
* Can you understand the value of this helicopter? The leader flew it to war and back! So of course it's worth a lot!
* To further increase the helicopter's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> value</span>, the leader bought himself a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>) and then tied them together. Now it has the value of a helicopter AND a car! Wow!
* Imagine driving a valuable car with the leader's helicopter on top. Yeah!
