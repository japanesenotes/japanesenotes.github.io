## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lion</span> harvesting <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice</span> uses an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> axe</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cut off</span> the tops of the stalks. The lion is roaming the rice fields using his axe to harvest the rice. He does so by cutting off the part of the rice stalks he needs.
* Picture this lion on his hind legs, walking through a rice field. He’s holding an axe in one hand and acting like a human. See him cut off the plants and hear the whoosh of the axe as he cuts.
* The lion will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cut off</span> rice stalks until <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dawn</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だん](https://jisho.org/search/だん)</span>). But at the first light of dawn, it will run and hide in the shade of the trees, cut off from the rice.
* When dawn comes in Africa (it's a lion, so that's where he is) it gets too hot to be in the sun, so the lion gets cut off from his job of cutting things off.
