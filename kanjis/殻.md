He is just a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> husk</span> of his former self. This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shell</span> of a samurai has nothing left.
* He's just sitting there, he can't even pick up his weapon or raise his head anymore.
* The only way to bring a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> husk</span> of a samurai back to life is to have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かく](https://jisho.org/search/かく)</span>) crow right in his ear.
* Co co co co cooooock! the cock screams, shocking the samurai back into his lifeless shell. You did it!
