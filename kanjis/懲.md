 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> loiter</span>ing <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mountain</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span> who hangs around during <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> to provide an indication (this kanji uses the indication kanji as its top 2/3rds) of things to come now looks into your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span>, and only sees bad things. So, he <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chastise</span>s you about it.
* What's in your heart is no good, he chastises you.
* Why is he chastising you, really, though? He foretold Mrs. Chou coming back in a previous mnemonic, but you saved Mrs. Chou on the beach (once again, in a previous mnemonic), so you could have prevented her second coming. He is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chastis</span>ing you for saving Mrs. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chou</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょう](https://jisho.org/search/ちょう)</span>).
* In the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [潮](https://jisho.org/search/潮)</span> kanji you saved Mrs. Chou from dying, so he is chastising you for it.
