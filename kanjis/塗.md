## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> surplus</span> will cover all the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> paint</span>. The surplus of tsunamis will strike the paint factories first (everyone knows paint factories are built close to the ocean). Then the paint will flow over all the dirt and paint it a ton of rainbow colors.
* Picture all of the different colors of paint being swept along by tsunami after tsunami, painting the dirt as it goes.
* You touch the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> paint</span> in the dirt with your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> toe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [と](https://jisho.org/search/と)</span>) to see if it's still wet. It is. The paint is still very wet and now your toe looks like a tiny rainbow.
* Imagine dipping each of your toes into the paint-dirt, one by one, to paint each of them a different color. Why are you doing this?
