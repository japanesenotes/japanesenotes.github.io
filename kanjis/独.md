## Mnemonics
 * There once was an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> animal</span> with an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> insect</span> friend who felt very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alone</span> unless he was around. An animal and an insect are an unlikely pairing, but these two get along delightfully and hate to be alone without the other.
* Imagine this animal and this insect. Let’s say it’s a flea and a dog. Imagine them going everywhere together. To the park, getting ice cream, even the drive in movie theater. They’re inseparable.
* One activity that the animal can never do <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alone</span> is solve Su<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> doku</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [どく](https://jisho.org/search/どく)</span>) puzzles. The insect always has to help him out with them, and together they are an unstoppable Sudoku solving team.
* Picture this animal with the insect on his head doing a Sudoku. See the insect hopping around on the animals head shouting answers and suggestions into the animal’s ear. How cute.
