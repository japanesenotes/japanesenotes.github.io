## Mnemonics
 * You have a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hill</span>, but the hill is a bit weird looking (take a look at the hill radical in this kanji). It's not any normal hill, it's a weird lumpy hill that isn't quite right. That's because it is a thread hill of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> netting</span>, and parts of the nets have caught things, like fish and cats, so there's weird abnormal lumps in them.
* You'll need to differentiate this from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [綱](https://jisho.org/search/綱)</span>, which uses the same radicals (though <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [綱](https://jisho.org/search/綱)</span> has a real hill radical). Just remember that the weird hill has stuff caught in it because it is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> netting</span>.
* There's so much <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> netting</span> that it's out of control. You decide to take your lawn mower to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mow</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もう](https://jisho.org/search/もう)</span>) it all down.
* When you do this, it destroys your lawn mower, because who thought it was a good idea to use a lawn mower on netting? Your dumb idea. C'mon!
