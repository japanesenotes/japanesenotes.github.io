## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Kings</span> with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hats</span>. Did you know that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> all</span> kings wear hats?
* Think of as many kings as you can think of. Guess what, every single one of them (aka <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> all</span> of them) wear hats! Think of strange hats, funny hats, and normal hats. Just make sure you're amazed by the fact they all are wearing them.
* But, as you're going through all the kings, it turns out not <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> all</span> of them have hats after all. The last one you come to does not have a hat. He is the king of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Zen</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぜん](https://jisho.org/search/ぜん)</span>) Buddhism. He has simple clothes and a shaved head, unlike all the other fancy kings standing around nearby.
* To add to this story and make it more memorable, you can imagine the other kings getting upset, saying things like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> All</span> kings must wear hats! You are no king! The king of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Zen</span> Buddhism just ignores them and begins to meditate.
