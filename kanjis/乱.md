Nobody likes to get stabbed in the tongue with an umbrella, so they’re probably going to retaliate, and before you know it, you’ve a full scale riot on your hands. Look what you’ve done.<br>
* Imagine yourself getting stabbed in the tongue with an umbrella. It’s very painful. Taste the blood and metal in your mouth as this happens to you.
* Just now you realize that the man you stabbed in the tongue with your umbrella was none other than Macho Man <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ran</span>dy Savage (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [らん](https://jisho.org/search/らん)</span>). Being a professional wrestler, Macho Man Randy Savage is ready to throw down at a moment’s notice. A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> riot</span> immediately erupts. It’s a battle royal with you and Randy at the epicenter.
* Picture yourself squaring off with Macho Man Randy Savage in the middle of this riot. You have the advantage of having an umbrella, but Randy has the advantage of being himself. Picture yourself getting into a fight with him.
