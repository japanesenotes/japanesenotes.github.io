## Mnemonics
 * Take your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leather</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> change</span> it into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shoes</span>.
* You start with a sheet of leather. Now imagine yourself going through the process of changing them to shoes. Smell the leather and feel it, too.
* Some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shoes</span> aren’t made from leather anymore these days, but you know who always wears shoes made of leather? Old <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coots</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くつ](https://jisho.org/search/くつ)</span>). Old coots are so old that the only shoes they wore growing up were made from leather so they refuse to wear any shoes that aren’t made from leather. Crazy old coots.
* Imagine some of these old coots busting into a modern shoe store and kicking over all the display stands and setting everything on fire because they hate non leather shoes so much. Hear the old coots screaming and babbling nonsense as they destroy the store.
