## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> skewer</span> to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span> has <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> afflicted</span> your health. You’ve been afflicted with a disease from the skewer to your heart. Your affliction is death. You’re dying.
* You did not wish to be afflicted as such. Feel the skewer in your heart and the great pain it gives you. You know you’re dying.
* Since you’re <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> afflicted</span> with the death, you start to hallucinate and the ghost of Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>) appears before you. Ah, I was afflicted of the same disease. It killed me, you know.
* You look on in horror as the affliction grabs hold and everything starts to fade, but Genghis Khan still floats before you, watching you closely.
