## Mnemonics
 * You cover <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shrimp</span> with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ice</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exhaust</span> it. The ice makes the shrimp really tired. Give them enough ice, and they will soon become exhausted.
* Imagine the shrimp getting covered in ice and then being all like, “Man, I’m so exhausted. How did this human know that ice would exhaust me so?”
* After you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exhaust</span> the shrimp, you put some ice on your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> jean</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じん](https://jisho.org/search/じん)</span>) to cool yourself down. Exhausting the shrimp exhausted you as well, and you’re really warm from all that work you just did so you put some ice in and on your jeans to cool down a bit.
* Imagine putting ice in your jeans. Dang, that’s cold. You can still smell the fishy smell of shrimp in the air though.
