## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Run</span> into <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> oneself</span> in a dream and you'll definitely <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wake up</span>.
* If you run into yourself, it really messes you up, you know? You won't be able to handle what you're seeing so you have to wake up.
* If one runs into oneself and you don't <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wake up</span>, just look down at your waist. If you're wearing an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> o</span>bi (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)</span>) you know it's a dream and you'll eventually wake up. If you aren't wearing an obi then it isn't a dream and you don't have anything to wake up from.
* Your obi is like a special object you only have in dreams. If you have your obi, it's okay, it's a dream and you can wake up now! Make sure you memorize exactly how it feels so dream-you can't trick you or something.
