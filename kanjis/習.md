## Mnemonics
 * I have LEARNED to withstand being tickled by white feathers.<br><br>You find some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> white</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> feathers</span> and you want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> learn</span> more about where they came from and what they're made of.
* Picture yourself in a library poring through huge tomes on birds, feathers, and the history of white birds. You want to learn everything you can!
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> learn</span> that you should tie these white feathers to your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shoe</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅう](https://jisho.org/search/しゅう)</span>). You do it before you learn what it will do, and then suddenly you're jump-flying out of the building.
* Oh geez, oh no. You better learn how to control these shoes before you—CRASH!!! Welp, you just shot through a plane. You need to learn more before you act next time.
