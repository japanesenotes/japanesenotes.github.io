## Mnemonics
 * There is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> coming, so you stand on your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> holding a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leaf</span>, wearing <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fins</span>, and standing before a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span> full of people. These are your neighbors and they're here to watch you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> perform</span>.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> performance</span> will distract all of you from the impending tsunami. You wave the leaf and dance with the fins. It's a wonderful performance.
* As the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> performance</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> en</span>ds (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [えん](https://jisho.org/search/えん)</span>), so do you all.
* The performance and the tsunami end together. How poetic.
