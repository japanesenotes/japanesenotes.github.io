## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tiger</span> kills a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> pig</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span> in this new <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> drama</span> about the animal kingdom! The tiger and pig used to be friends when they were younger, but now they're bitter enemies and the tiger just stabbed the pig right in the chest with a knife.
* Picture this scene from the drama as dramatically as you can. The pig stares into the tiger's eyes, Tiger, you wouldn't–uh! The pig's eyes slowly lower to see the knife sticking into its gut, the tiger's hand still holding it. This is what you get, you pig, the tiger spits back, twisting.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> drama</span> is being put on by <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Gecki</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [げき](https://jisho.org/search/げき)</span>), your childhood pet gecko. Gecki is playing all the parts, because as true drama fans know, one-gecko-shows are the highest form of art.
* Picture Gecki acting out the part of the tiger and the pig in this drama. It's so intense, you're moved to tears. Bravo Gecki, bravo!
