## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> feather</span> radical and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> feather</span> are the same in looks as well as in meaning.
* Have you been studying your radicals? If so, this'll be easy!
* All these <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> feather</span>s. You're a bird man / woman, and you're getting ready to fly. Just as you're about to take off, someone dumps you with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> honey</span> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はね](https://jisho.org/search/はね)</span> and you're all goopy, unable to go anywhere.
* Taste the honey, feel it all over your feathers. Go ahead and plummet towards the ground (because you were jumping off a building to fly when someone doused you with honey). At least it's a tasty way to go, no?
