## Mnemonics
 * To your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> car</span> you take an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> axe</span>. The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> has broken your car for good this time (you think). You're so angry at your car. You think this is permanent. Turns out, though, that it's not permanent. It's just like that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> temporarily</span>. You did make it permanent by taking an axe to your car, though.
* Feel sad that you were the one to destroy your car for good, even though the sun messed it up temporarily. 
* You were driving around in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Zan</span>zibar (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ざん](https://jisho.org/search/ざん)</span>) when this happened, too, so now you're stuck in Zanzibar, a foreign place, and you have no idea what to do next.
* You should probably be worried about this situation.
