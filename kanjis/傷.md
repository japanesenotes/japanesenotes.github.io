* Which leader wounded the Japanese people? The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>). The Shougun is a military leader. The Shougun even has gun in the name. And they wounded hundreds of thousands of samurai and soldiers.
* Picture the Shougun you've slowly grown to know over the last thirty-ish levels. But he's holding a gun wounding everyone around him. He's screaming and shooting and wounding everyone in sight. Even his mom, even his dog, even his farmers.
