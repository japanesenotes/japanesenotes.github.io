## Mnemonics
 * I <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span>, which weighs more: a kilogram of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span>s or a kilogram of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice</span>? This is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> riddle</span>!
* Think carefully and see if you can come up with the answer to my riddle before you read on.
* Did you figure out the answer to this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> riddle</span>? Say your answer aloud to the screen right now.... <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> not so</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なぞ](https://jisho.org/search/なぞ)</span>)! You're wrong.
* Did you say the answer to the riddle is that they're both a kilogram? Not so! A scooter is heavier than some rice! And don't you email me saying that's not so! It's my riddle, I can make the answer whatever I want. That's the law of riddles!
