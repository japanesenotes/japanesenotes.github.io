## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> has an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> omen</span> growing from it, one single <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> peach</span> that is the size of a house. Inside is a child who will save the village from demons.
* Of course, this tree omen of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> peach</span> refers to momotaro, the little boy who was born from a peach (you should look it up if you don't know this children's story).
* If <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> momo</span>taro (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もも](https://jisho.org/search/もも)</span>) wasn't enough, think about the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> peach</span> growing larger and larger. You want it to grow bigger, so you yell at it: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> MO</span>RE! <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> MO</span>RE! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もも](https://jisho.org/search/もも)</span>).
* It grows bigger everytime you say MORE MORE twice. If you say it just once, it stays the same.
