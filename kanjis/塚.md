## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> forehead</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> pig</span> makes a small <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mound</span>. Picture it, if you will. A pig is rooting through the dirt. It lifts its head and there is a mound of dirt right on its forehead.
* Imagine that you're the pig. How big can you make your forehead dirt mound?
* The pig's forehead dirt <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mound</span> keeps getting bigger until it's the size of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two cars</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つか](https://jisho.org/search/つか)</span>)! Pigs are big, but you didn't think one could balance a mound the size of two cars on its forehead and not fall over.
* Picture a pig with a mound of dirt the size of two cars leisurely stomping around on a farm.
