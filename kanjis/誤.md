## Mnemonics
 * They <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> accidentally firing a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> catapult</span> is an unforgivable <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mistake</span>. They say you shot the catapult at your own castle. Even though it was an accident, it’s still a mistake you will never be forgiven for.
* Imagine shooting the catapult on your own people by mistake. Hear the catapult whoosh as your heart drops into your stomach. Oh, what a terrible mistake you’ve just made.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mistake</span> alerts <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Go</span>dzilla (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ご](https://jisho.org/search/ご)</span>), who thinks it's town destroying time. He barrels over the hills, sees where you mistakenly catapulted your own people, and proceeds to stomp on the rest of it for you.
* Picture Godzilla jumping happily on the castle and surrounding town you hit by mistake. This is probably the worst mistake you've ever made.
