## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span>, even though it's almost <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spring</span>, is still covered in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ice</span> so it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cold</span>. Inside the house is cold, outside the house is cold. Everything is cold!
* Picture the entire roof covered in ice. It's supposed to be spring right now, but it's too cold for the ice to melt off your roof.
* You can't stand the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cold</span> anymore, so you hire a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> samu</span>rai to come try to hack the ice off of your roof with his sword. You stand outside shivering, and watching as the samurai tries to stab the ice off of your roof.
* The samurai isn't doing a good job stopping the cold, and soon he and his sword have frozen into your ice roof. So now it's cold and you have a dead samurai stuck to your house. Great.
