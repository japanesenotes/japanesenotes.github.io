## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Blood</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hair</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tofu</span> make up the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> populace</span>. Those are the three categories the entire populace fits into, anyway.
* Blood shows that all the people are related. Hair shows that we're all humans. Tofu is food to all. So, as you can see, those three words describe the entire populace.
* The entire <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> populace</span> deserves <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shoe</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅう](https://jisho.org/search/しゅう)</span>). It's a basic thing all humans should have like flowing blood, hair (somewhere), and tofu to eat.
* If you see people in your populace without shoes, it's your job as a fellow member of society to help them get some!
