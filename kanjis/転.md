## Mnemonics
 * Musk's car is currently REVOLVING around the earth (above the CLOUDS)<br><br>If your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> car</span> runs into a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cloud</span> you'll <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> revolve</span> around it instead of going straight through. Clouds are really hard to see through, so even though you're trying not to, you revolve in a tight circle up and around the cloud anyway.
* Imagine driving your car around and around the cloud, instead of going through it. At least it's soft and cool.
* You have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> revolve</span> around the cloud <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ten</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てん](https://jisho.org/search/てん)</span>) times before it disappears and you're able to go through.
* Unfortunately, not long after you get through that cloud another one comes down and gets in your way. Now you're counting each revolution, one... two... three... all the way up to ten.
