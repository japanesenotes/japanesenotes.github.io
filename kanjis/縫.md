## Mnemonics
 * You take some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span>, put your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> up to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> signpost</span>, and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sew</span> them together. You don't have a lock, so sewing your scooter up to the signpost to keep it safe is all you can think of.
* Imagine slowly sewing your scooter to the signpost, passing the thread back and forth through the signpost's metal holes and your scooter's handles.
* You usually only <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sew</span> at <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ho</span>me (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほう](https://jisho.org/search/ほう)</span>), so this is a big exception for you. You're usually worried that if you sew in public people will judge your stitches, so this is a big step for you!
* Hopefully, if your scooter is still here later you'll be able to start sewing outside of your home more often from now on!
