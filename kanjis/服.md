## Mnemonics
 * Take the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stamp</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span> in front of you and use it on all of your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clothes</span>. Now even if you sell or lose a piece of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clothing</span>, you'll be able to find it again by checking for your special moon stamp.
* Imagine placing each piece of clothing you own onto the stool and carefully stamping them with a symbol of the moon. This should stop people from stealing all of your clothes!
* A few days later you're with a friend when you recognize the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clothes</span> they're wearing. You grab it, rip it off, and scream, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> F**k</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふく](https://jisho.org/search/ふく)</span>) you! There is your moon stamp! These are your clothes!!
* Your friend turns red and tries to pull the clothes back, F**k you! they yell. No, f**k you, these are my clothes and I have proof this time!
