## Mnemonics
 * Each <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> life</span> has a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> soul</span>, and that soul determines what <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gender</span> you are. It's not so much about your body parts, it's more about what's inside that matters.
* Picture your own soul and your own life. Listen to what your soul says about your gender and live your life to the fullest!
* Once you've decided what your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gender</span> is, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>) comes to your house, lays his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sa</span>ber (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せい](https://jisho.org/search/せい)</span>) on your shoulders, and then it's official! It's in all the newspapers, there's a parade, and everyone is patting you on the back because you did it!
* The next time you get one of those surveys where you have to choose your gender just think back to that time your life when the Shougun came and officiated your gender with his saber. Ahh, what lovely memories.
