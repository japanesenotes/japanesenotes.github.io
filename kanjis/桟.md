## Mnemonics
 * Carve a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> into a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bar</span> and lay it sticking out into the water to make a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> jetty</span> or a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pier</span>. Now you can walk out on the jetty and go further into the water without needing a boat or getting wet.
* Imagine laying your tree turned bar into the water to make your own jetty. Innovative!
* You made this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> jetty</span> so it would be easier for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> San</span>ta-san (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さん](https://jisho.org/search/さん)</span>) to dock his sleigh. Oh, you didn't know? His sleigh is more of a speed boat now, so he needs a jetty to give you presents, not a chimney anymore.
* Picture Santa-san coming in from the water on his speedboat and docking on your jetty to deliver presents to you.
