## Mnemonics
 * You have a great <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ability</span> because your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span> gives you the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> appearance</span> of a superhuman. Your heart is really strong and powerful, fuelling your body to the best of its ability. All this together gives you the appearance of someone in top condition.
* See yourself in this ideal appearance. Everyone loves to look at you because you look so awesome. Your heart has given you many great abilities. Feel strong and powerful in this body of yours.
* While you may have the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> appearance</span> of someone who is super strong, powerful, and awesome, you do have one shortcoming. You don’t know how to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tie</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たい](https://jisho.org/search/たい)</span>) a tie. Actually, you don’t even know how to tie your shoes, let alone your tie. How embarrassing.
* Since you don’t know how to tie a tie or tie your shoes, you wear slip ons and clip ons. Hear the noise of Velcro being undone as you kick off your shoes and unclip your tie after a hard day’s work at the office.
