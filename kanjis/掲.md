## Mnemonics
 * You're in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> prison</span>, but you can use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spoon</span> in the light of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> display</span> little moving pictures on your cell wall. It's like a shadow puppet display except you can only make a few characters with your limited hand tools.
* Imagine displaying your two favorite characters in the shadows on your prison cell walls. This one is mister fingers and this one is missus spoon. They're best friends.
* There is one thing you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> display</span> more than anything else and it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>ke (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けい](https://jisho.org/search/けい)</span>). You smush your fingers to make a cake shape and use the spoon to pretend you're eating it.
* Imagine displaying cake on the wall. Now pretend to eat the shadow cake with your spoon. You can almost taste it. Except you can't, because this is still prison.
