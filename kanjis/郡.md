## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> buddy</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span> is in the next <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> county</span>. If it was in your county then it wouldn't be a buddy, it would be a neighbor. You're aware of this building, but they aren't that close, so they're just a buddy.
* Imagine looking at a map of your county and the surrounding ones. All of the buildings in the counties next to yours are buddy buildings!
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> county</span> is everything you can reach when shooting a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gun</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぐん](https://jisho.org/search/ぐん)</span>). If the bullet can't reach a building you know, it's a buddy building in another county.
* Imagine taking out a gun and shooting in a random direction. When you find where the bullet landed, you know that's the county line. Though if it gets stuck in a building or a person it doesn't count. You'll have to try again.
