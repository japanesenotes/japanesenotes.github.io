 * When you're in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> prison</span>, whoever ends up with the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lose</span>. It's the game all prisoners play. It's like keep away from the shellfish. And if you end up with the shellfish BZZZZTT that's it, you're the loser.<div><br></div><div><div>

<div>Above we have the condensed form of <span style=font-style: italic;>bound up, and below the familiar <span style=font-style: italic;>shellfish. Now imagine two <span style=font-style: italic;>oysters engaged in
<span style=font-style: italic;>shell-to-<span style=font-style: italic;>shell combat, the one who is <span style=font-weight: 700;>defeated being <span style=font-style: italic;>bound and gagged with seaweed, the victor towering
triumphantly over it. The <span style=font-style: italic;>bound shellfish thus becomes the symbol for <span style=font-weight: 700;>defeat. [9]&nbsp;</div>

* Imagine that it's your first day in prison. You're walking around the yard, minding your own business, when suddenly a shellfish smacks you right in the head and falls into your open hands. HAHA YOU LOSE! someone shouts.
* If you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lose</span>, you're a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foo</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>). All you had to do was not hold the prison shellfish. It really shouldn't have been that hard to not lose, ya fool.
* Now you have to try to make some other fool lose. Otherwise you'll be the loser fool forever.
