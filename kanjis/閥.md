 * <div><div>You set a guard at the gate to fell intruders not of your<strong>&nbsp;clique</strong>.</div></div><div><div><i></i></div></div><br>Passed out in front of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gate</span> lies a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span> who used to be the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> of a popular <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clique</span>, the Cool Kids <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Clan</span>. Once, he was a leader, but now he is but a drunkard. The clan has fallen apart, and he no longer has a clique to call his own.<br>
* Imagine this washed up drunkard leader passed out in front of the gate to your house. You have to pass him whenever you enter or exit your house. He’s gross and he smells. Experience the stench in your nostrils. How he was ever the leader of a clan you have no idea.
* Eventually you get sick and tired of this washed up <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clan</span> leader and you gather your own <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clique</span> to chase this guy away from your gate and your property. You and your friends grab some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bats</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばつ](https://jisho.org/search/ばつ)</span>) and use these bats to beat the drunkard leader. Being beaten with bats frightens him, and he scurries away.
* Hear the crushing blows of bats against flesh as you imagine this scene in your mind. You’re beating the crap out of this guy with a bunch of bats, but hey – he had it coming.
