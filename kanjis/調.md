## Mnemonics
 * When I INVESTIGATE something, i SAY a lot of clues outloud. Part of INVESTIGATION is checking CIRCUMFERENCES....<br><br><br>You <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> something about the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> circumference</span> of this area. You've looked around this whole area, making a big circle around it, because you are trying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> investigate</span> something that happened here. You also say this thing in a really quiet <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tone</span> of voice, because you don't want the person or thing you're investigating to know you're on to them.
* Because the radical <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> circumference</span> is in play, you can think of the crime scene you're investigating as a statue of a giant globe, and you're doing a circumference around it. Then, in the reading, we'll think about what you'll <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span>.
* I came here to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> investigate</span> this place, and I did indeed find out who the criminal is... it's none other than Mrs. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chou</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょう](https://jisho.org/search/ちょう)</span>)!
* From what you know about evil Mrs. Chou, you probably could have guessed it was her. The Circumference Investigation is now over, though you do still have to catch the perp, Mrs. Chou.
