## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fire</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span> burns down the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> field</span>. The rice paddy fire spreads out from the paddy and consumes the field next to it. This rice paddy fire has ravaged your entire farm!
* Look at this fire burning the rice paddy and the surrounding field. Smell burnt rice in the air as you see the flames dance before your eyes.
* Your rice paddy farm and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> field</span> are on a cay. A cay is a small, sandy island, and since your farm is on fire, this cay has turned into a hot cay. Or as Mario would say, that’s one-a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hot-a cay</span>! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はたけ]([はた](https://jisho.org/search/はた)け)</span>) Mama mia!
* Imagine running around this hot cay as you try to put out the fire in your field. The fire is ravaging the entire hot cay, so it takes you a while to put it out. Man those flames are hot.<br />Also, this kanji can have the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はた](https://jisho.org/search/はた)</span> for the kun'yomi as well. If you learn the longer version (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はたけ]([はた](https://jisho.org/search/はた)け)</span>) it will be easier to just shave off a kana to remember the shorter version.
