## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> gets a nice uniform for the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sake</span> of not wanting to look like a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fake</span>. The leader is a fake, he just doesn’t want to look like one. He’s not really a leader, but he thinks he should get an official-looking uniform for the sake of not looking like a fake.
* Look at this fake leader. See him scramble into a uniform. Does he look like a real leader? Or can you tell that he is a fake?
* Well, everyone found out he was a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fake</span> anyway, and now you're all going to use a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gui</span>llotine (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎ](https://jisho.org/search/ぎ)</span>) to cut off his fake head.
* Watch as the guillotine comes down. You close your eyes for a second, and when you open them you see that the leader's body was a fake! Wait, where did he go?!
