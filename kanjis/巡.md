## Mnemonics
 * You're using your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> to navigate the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flood</span> because you're on <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> patrol</span>. You're one of the few people with a floating scooter, so it's your job to patrol the flood waters and look for people and animals that need help.
* Imagine patrolling the flood waters on your scooter, which is bubbling and scooting along on the surface of the water. You have to be extremely vigilant in your patrol, you don't want any lives to be lost on your watch.
* You have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> patrol</span> all of the floods in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> June</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゅん](https://jisho.org/search/じゅん)</span>). Unfortunately, that's the month when most of the floods in Japan happen, so you end up on patrol a lot.
* You're in a group with a bunch of other scooter people, and you're all assigned to one month of flood patrol duty. But you got June. The floodiest month. Womp womp.
