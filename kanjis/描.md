## Mnemonics
 * When you see <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span> you can't help but use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> draw</span> them. Have you ever seen rice paddy flowers? They're beautiful. And if you can draw them you can capture that beauty and show it to everyone.
* Imagine using your fingers to draw these rice paddy flowers. Don't worry about how well you can draw, this is so beautiful, anyone could capture it.
* Even though you tried to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> draw</span> the flowers as best you could, whenever someone looks at it they smell <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> B.O.</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [びょう](https://jisho.org/search/びょう)</span>). Maybe it's because you were drawing for a really long time and kept sweating. Maybe it's because you are just a stinky person. But no one wants to look at your drawing for long because all they can smell is B.O.
* To be fair, would you want to look at a drawing that makes you constantly smell stinky B.O.? I didn't think so.
