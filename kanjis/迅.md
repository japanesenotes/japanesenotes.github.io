## Mnemonics
 * You drive your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> off this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cliff</span>, holding your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> tight to your chest, at a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> swift</span> speed.
* Imagine swiftly shooting off the side of the cliff on your scooter, holding the cross for dear life.
* Because you had such a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> swift</span> take off, you didn't notice that your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> jean</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じん](https://jisho.org/search/じん)</span>) were ripped right off your body. Until now.
* Now you're swiftly shooting through the sky as your jeans flutter down toward the ground behind you. You also feel a swift breeze on all of your downstairs bits now.
