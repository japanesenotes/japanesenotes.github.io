## Mnemonics
 * You tie a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> on your finger before jumping in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> pool</span> to remind yourself of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> promise</span> you made to your mother. The thread represents the promise you made to mow the lawn after you finished swimming in the pool.
* The promise reminding thread on your finger was tied too tight. You can feel the thread starting to cut off your circulation as your finger starts to turn purple and go numb. It’s really uncomfortable.
* After you get out of the pool, you keep the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> promise</span> you made to your mother. So you get on your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yak</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [やく](https://jisho.org/search/やく)</span>) powered mower and trim the grass. Yes, your mower is pulled by a yak. It’s very efficient.
* Imagine yourself sitting on a riding mower as you’re pulled around the yard by a yak. The yak is having a hard time pulling you so its making lots of yak noises. Hear them in your mind.
