## Mnemonics
 * They <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> if you use a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hat</span> to cover the area your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hair</span> used to be, chances are you had a doctor <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> diagnose</span> you with cancer. Sometimes after you get diagnosed with cancer, the process makes you lose your hair, and you have to wear a hat. It’s sad, but true.
* Imagine the doctor diagnosing you with cancer. All of your hair falls out just thinking about it. Now put on your hat.
* You just had the doctor <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> diagnose</span> you with cancer. How terrible. You stumble out of the room, dumbfounded. Not paying attention you bang your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shin</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しん](https://jisho.org/search/しん)</span>) on the table. Your shin really hurts. What an awful day.
* Hold your shin as you feel the throbbing pain in it. Even though the pain is so extreme, you can’t help but still think about the diagnosis you got from the doctor.
