## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> coffin</span> has been left out in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> for too long. When dead bodies are out in the sun like this, they really begin to decompose. You are wondering who this person is, though. You can't tell because it's fallen apart too much. You look on the coffin. There's a label, but it only says <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> someone</span>.
* Smell the stench of the decomposing body. Also, feel really curious as to who this person is. It came from somewhere that gives you a reason to believe it's someone you know. Then, feel the disappointment as you read the label that says someone instead of an actual name. Someone, you repeat. Someone.
* <div>WHEN YOU MEET SOMEBODY, YOU GREET THEM WITH THE TRADITIONAL TJA. THUS SOMEBODY = TJA</div><div><br></div>To remember the sound <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゃ](https://jisho.org/search/しゃ)</span> we use shaman.<br>It's time you open the coffin and check. Maybe there's more answers in there. There's no way this person could just be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> someone</span>. You lift the lid, and sure enough, you're able to figure out who it is. It's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sha</span>man (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゃ](https://jisho.org/search/しゃ)</span>), dressed in full shaman garb.
* How strange that a shaman was delivered to you this way! Come up with a story explaining why this shaman's body is here at your door, rotting in the sun. Make it ridiculous and interesting so you remember it.
