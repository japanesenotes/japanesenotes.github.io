## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> who hires his own personal <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> clown</span> will likely <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> double</span> his entertainment. Clowns are funny and make people laugh, so the leader decided to hire one. Since that time, the leader’s amount of mirth has doubled. <br />This also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> times</span>, which makes sense when you think about the kind of math you'll need to double something. What is A * 2? It's A doubled, first of all, but you're using multiplication. You're timesing something.
* Picture a clown and all the ridiculous funny things they do. Imagine the clown throwing a pie at someone’s face and how funny that is. Chuckle to yourself and remember this kanji.
* When the clown stops being funny, it’s time to say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bye</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばい](https://jisho.org/search/ばい)</span>). At first, the clown <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> double</span>d the leader’s entertainment, but now the clown is just annoying. It’s time to say bye-bye.
* This clown has served its purpose. Wave your hand in the air and say bye-bye to this worthless clown.
