 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Viking</span> moves your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> with his <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hand</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> manipulate</span> it. He sticks his hand into your mouth. With the Viking's hand in your mouth, he can make you look like you’re saying anything he wants.
* Imagine the Viking having his hand in your mouth. Taste his salty flesh on your tongue. Imagine him manipulating your mouth and your jaw and making it look like you are saying all sorts of funny things.
* The Viking is manipulating you so that he can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> manipulate</span> the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>)! You and the Shougun have grown pretty close over the last year or so, and this Viking is going to take advantage!
* You don't want to manipulate the Shougun, but you can't seem to get the Viking's hand out of your mouth. You frantically imagine all the manipulative things the Viking could get the Shougun to do for him like this.
