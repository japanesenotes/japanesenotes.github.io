## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> blue</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blue</span> kanji are exactly the same.
* Don't feel blue, you should know this kanji automagically!
* You've been feeling really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blue</span>. Mostly because your skin, hair, and eyes have all turned blue. The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>) found out and now he's back. He places his hand on your shoulder and then points at your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sa</span>ber (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せい](https://jisho.org/search/せい)</span>). It's blue too! You aren't alone!
* You aren't sure how you or the saber turned blue, but you're pretty sure the Shougun had something to do with it. At least you match now, I guess.
