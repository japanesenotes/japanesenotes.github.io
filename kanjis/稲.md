## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grain</span> stuck in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cleat</span> had a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> former</span> life. In that life it was a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rice plant</span>. It was a happy little rice plant, minding its own business, when it was yanked up and cleaned up and put in a bag for people to buy and cook and eat. That was so long ago. Now it's just a sad grain in the bottom of your shoe.
* When you look at a grain of rice, you should think of it's former life as a rice plant, not where it ended up.
* The grain of rice, as it thinks about its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rice plant</span> life too, mutters, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> いな、いね</span>. Yes little grain, it was a really nice life. I'm sorry.
* You decide to bring the grain back to where all of the other rice plants are, and they all chant <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いな、いね](https://jisho.org/search/いな、いね)</span> as you return it to its home. You did a good thing today.
