## Mnemonics
 * With kids&nbsp;<em>growing up</em>&nbsp;in your&nbsp;<em>house</em>, you have to keep them from&nbsp;<strong>harm</strong>&nbsp;of putting anything in their&nbsp;<em>mouth</em>, paint chips, bleach, knvies, etc.<br><br>You slip off the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span>, your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> life</span> flashes before your eyes, and you smash your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> on the ground causing some serious <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> damage</span>. Oof, this is a really bad <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> injury</span>, you fell all the way off the roof and onto your mouth.
* Imagine that moment as you fall off the roof. In slow motion you can see the roof moving away, you see yourself as a little kid, a teen, an adult, then BAM you've injured your mouth. Ow ow ow!
* As you try to assess the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> damage</span>, you hear someone shout, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Guy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がい](https://jisho.org/search/がい)</span>), hey, you okay, guy? They run up to you, but your mouth is too <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> damage</span>d, you can't respond. Okay guy, I'm gonna call you Guy now. Let's get you to the hospital.
* No matter how much you try to wave your hands and gesture, they keep calling you Guy. It's really annoying, actually, because you aren't a guy and you aren't Guy either. But your mouth is too damaged for you to tell him.
