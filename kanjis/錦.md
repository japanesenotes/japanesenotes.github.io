## Mnemonics
 * You weave <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gold</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> white</span> patterns into this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> towel</span>, turning it into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> brocade</span>. It's beautiful, elegant, and worth way more than when it was just a plain towel.
* Imagine weaving this beautiful brocade fabric out of one of your old towels. Try to actually picture the gold and white patterns you want on there. If you're a crafter, actually do it!
* You want to keep your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> brocade</span> fabrics safe, so you lock them away and seal them in with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> niche key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にしき](https://jisho.org/search/にしき)</span>). It's niche because brocade is a very niche kind of thing.
* Imagine using your niche key to open this hidden brocade storage room. The key is gold and white and looks like brocade too!
