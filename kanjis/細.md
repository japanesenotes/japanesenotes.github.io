## Mnemonics

* Imagine a rice paddy that's as thin as a piece of thread. You'd maybe be able to get one line of rice in there? Seems very inefficient.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thin</span> rice paddy is for your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cy</span>borg (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さい](https://jisho.org/search/さい)</span>). You only gave your cyborg a really thin strip of human stomach, so it only needs a thin line of rice to eat.
* Picture the cyborg eating a really thin piece of rice. Now it's completely full! What a smart, thrifty cyborg!
