* You can't just let people do whatever they want. If it isn't correct to loiter here, then it IS correct to subjugate them, and force them to do what you want. You control them now. And they're gonna get it!
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> subjugate</span> these loiterers with your holy blue <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sa</span>ber (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せい](https://jisho.org/search/せい)</span>)! It's the correct thing to do, after all, and you were given this saber all those levels ago because you did the correct thing.
* As you swing your saber around, subjugating the loiterers, and making them do as you say, you remind yourself that this is correct. And if it's correct, you have to use your saber to enforce it.
