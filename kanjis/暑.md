## Mnemonics
 * When <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> someone</span> goes out in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span>, they get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hot</span>. That’s just how it is. Someone standing out in the sun for a long time will inevitably get hot. The sun is hot, and it makes you get hot too.
* Imagine you are this someone, standing out in the hot sun. Feel the sun’s hot rays beating down on you as you stand outside. The hot sun makes you start to sweat and you get all sweaty and sticky from the heat. Note that this usually refers to the hot weather or the heat of an area you're in and doesn't refer to a hot thing.
* You need to get out of this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hot</span> sun and into some air conditioning. Then you remember there’s a great air conditioning unit <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> at Su</span>zie’s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あつ](https://jisho.org/search/あつ)</span>) house. Ah, Suzie – our savior! If you need me, I’ll be at Suzie’s place.
* Imagine that great feeling when you go from hot and sticky outside to nice and air conditioned inside. Feel the heat transition on your skin as you step into an air conditioned room at Suzie’s. It gives you goose bumps.
