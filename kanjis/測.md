## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> will pick up a bunch of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> and dump them on your shore, so you take a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> measure</span> them.
* You can't eat shellfish that are too small, so you place your knife along them to measure them. If they're big enough, you stick the knife in and eat them raw.
* All of the shellfish you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> measure</span> that are too small go into your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そく](https://jisho.org/search/そく)</span>). Once the sock is full, you swing it around you head and lob it back into the ocean.
* If you measure one of these shellfish and it's too small, stuff it right into your sock. Then once the sock measures about 12 shellfish long, toss it back to sea!
