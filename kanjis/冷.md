## Mnemonics
 * You got your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ice</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> orders</span>. Of course, your ice orders are to make things <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cool</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cold</span>.
* Making things cool and cold are pretty much the only orders you'll hear from ice. Ice is very simple in that regard.
* How will you make things <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cool</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cold</span>? You'll use a special <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ray</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れい](https://jisho.org/search/れい)</span>) gun that shoots a cold ray.
* Imagine a cold ray coming out of your ray gun. Anything it touches becomes cold. Stay cool, bird boy, you say.<br />Hint: when you see the radical <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> orders</span> it's fairly likely the reading will be <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れい](https://jisho.org/search/れい)</span>.
