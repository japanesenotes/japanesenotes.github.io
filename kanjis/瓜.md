## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> melon</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> melon</span> kanji are exactly the same! Wahoo!
* Make sure you remember this radical means melon and you'll remember the kanji meaning too!
* What's the best use for a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> melon</span>? Not eating it, but running over it in your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>)! Melons make a nice big splat sound when you drive over them, and that's what you plan to do to every melon you see.
* Imagine hitting the gas pedal in your car as you head for a big melon. Watch it burst into a million pieces as your car makes contact, hurling melon bits all over your windshield. It's a melon firework!
