## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> uses a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stick</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> made of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hair</span> to enforce <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> discipline</span>. The leader uses the stick made of hair to discipline his followers. He hits them with it.
* Imagine the leader disciplining his people with the hair stick in the winter. Imagine him yelling “DISCIPLINE!!” with each hit of the stick as you feel the cold winter air around you.
* If the leader uses a stick to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> discipline</span> his followers, eventually they'll fight back. The disciplined masses start to take off their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shoe</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅう](https://jisho.org/search/しゅう)</span>) and throw them at the leader!
* Watch as the leader gets pelted with all sorts of types of shoes. Boots, high heels, baby slippers. They're all colliding with him as the people shout, Discipline solves nothing!
