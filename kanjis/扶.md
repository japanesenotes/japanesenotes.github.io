## Mnemonics
 * Put your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> on your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> husband</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> aid</span> him. There's something about a spouse's touch that just makes you feel better. Have you ever had someone rub your back while you were hurt or sick or sad? It's nice, right?
* Imagine rubbing your husband's back with your fingers to aid him. You want him to feel better. You want him to get that comforting feeling that this kind of touching gives.
* Unfortunately, your husband wouldn't need your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> aid</span> if he wasn't such a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foo</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>). He walks into doors, he falls down the stairs, he touches the plate when the waiter says it's hot. And every single time your fool husband hurts himself, you aid him.
* That's true love, my friend.
