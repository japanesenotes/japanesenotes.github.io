## Mnemonics
 * This is another kanji that is the same as the radical. Both <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tree</span> are the same in looks and meaning.
* So, how are those radicals doing? Do you know them well?
* You’re walking through the trees, looking at them. They look ominous. Then, your foot gets stuck in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> muck</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もく](https://jisho.org/search/もく)</span>) and you try to pull your leg out, but can’t. Then the trees next to you begin to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mock</span> you. Even the mocking birds mock you. It’s terrible. It’s painful. You’re being mocked while you’re stuck in the muck.
* Feel the shame, feel the irritation. Make yourself want to break free just so you can go attack those dumb trees making fun of you and mocking you.
