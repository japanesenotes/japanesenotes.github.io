## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> runs into <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> nine</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span>s and produces a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dye</span> the color of the forest. The tsunami water mixes with each tree, nine of them actually, and the resulting liquid is a forest green dye.
* Imagine this happening in front of you. See the tsunami turn from the color of water to the color of a forest. The dye washes over you and now you’re forest green as well.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dye</span> continues to pass through the forest and hits a group of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cen</span>taurs (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span>). Now each centaur is dyed with the forest green dye. They don’t look happy.
* Hear each centaur shouting about how he hates that dye for changing his color. They look kind of funny, so you laugh at them a bit, but not too loud – they might hear you and get even more angry.
