## Mnemonics
 * During a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span>, your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lip ring</span> is ripped off while you’re trying to cross a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> river</span>. There was no other path to safety, you had to cross the raging river, but you lost your footing and smashed your face on a rock and lost your lip ring.
* Imagine how painful this would be, having your lip ring ripped from your lip. It would hurt a lot. Touch your lip and imagine missing half of it. Yikes.
* But why were you trying to cross this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> river</span> anyway? Well your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>) was on the other side of it, and you figured if you could get to your car you could outrun the tsunami and be safe. Too bad you fell and ripped out your lip ring though.
* Imagine yourself fording the river, all wet and cold from the water. Keeping your eyes on your car, you move slowly across. Look at the car. Look at it!
