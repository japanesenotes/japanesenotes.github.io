## Mnemonics
 * You put your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> foot</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bar</span> at the gymnasium at your very first <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> practice</span>. That's a big accomplishment since you're here learning how to walk on that long bar like all the cool gymnasts. But you can't just start right away, you need lots of practice so that's why you're here in this class. But so far you got your foot on the bar already, good for you!
* Picture your foot touching the bar. This is it. This is exactly what you're at this gym to practice.
* This type of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> practice</span> is especially hard for you because you're a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cen</span>taur (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span>). You only have hooves for feet, and balancing on a bar is going to be a huge hurdle. But your teacher promised if you practiced enough you could make it, and here you are! With your hoofed foot on the bar!
* Picture your centaur foot on the bar as you practice to become a gymnast. It's going to take years and years of this kind of practice, but you're sure you'll make it all the way up there some day! Never give up!
