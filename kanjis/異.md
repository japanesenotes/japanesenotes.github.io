## Mnemonics
 * Put a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> together</span> with other paddies and you'll see how much they <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> differ</span>. When you're driving or taking a train through the countryside it may seem like all of those rice paddies blurring together are all the same, but they can differ quite a bit!
* Try to picture how each rice paddy differs from the next. Can you think of any differences in the ones you've seen?
* To see how rice paddies <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> differ</span>, you need an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gle's (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>) eye view. It can be hard to see from the ground, so soar up into the sky like an eagle and look down at the rice paddies together.
* Aha! As an eagle you can easily see that all of the rice paddies have differing colors, shapes, and (if you fly low) smells. They differ a lot!
