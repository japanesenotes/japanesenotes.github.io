## Mnemonics
 * Seeing a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stone</span> and some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> next to a piece of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> poop</span> and another piece of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> poop</span>, you try and pick each of them up with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> magnet</span>. The magnet fails to pick up either piece of poop. The magnet doesn’t pick up the horns either. But wait! The magnet picks up the stone!
* Imagine yourself trying to pick each object up off the ground with your magnet. Hear the clink of the stone against metal as the magnet lifts it off the ground. Must be some iron in it or something.
* You’re pretty excited that you lifted something up with your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> magnet</span>. Science is cool! But then you hear someone laughing behind you. It’s <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Je</span>sus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span>)! Jesus was using his magic to levitate the stone all along, it wasn’t your magnet. Darn it Jesus! You’ve fooled me for the last time!
* Imagine Jesus snickering behind you as the stone falls to the ground once again. Imagine running after Jesus so you can catch him and give him a piece of your mind. He’s always playing tricks on you.
