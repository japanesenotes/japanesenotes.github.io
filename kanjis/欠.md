## Mnemonics
 * This kanji is the same as the radical it comes from. <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Lack</span> becomes <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Lack</span>!
* If you know the radical you know this.
* To remember <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けつ](https://jisho.org/search/けつ)</span>, we use the word ketsup. It's the perfect blend of ketchup and catsup!<br />You're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lack</span>ing something in your fridge. You look around, trying to find the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ketsu</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けつ](https://jisho.org/search/けつ)</span>) you lack. You can't find it, because you lack it.
* Imagine having to use regular, ordinary ketchup, or just old, boring catsup on your burger. Or even worse, an actual tomato. BLEH!
