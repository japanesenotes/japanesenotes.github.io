## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> private</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grain</span>s are meant to stay <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> private</span>! You shouldn't be sharing them with the whole town, they're just for you.<br />This kanji also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> I</span>. Why? Because what's more private than you? I mean, I! Basically, some things are only the business of you (I) and those things should be private.
* Look at your private grains. Who are those for? Why, they're for I!
* You're getting into the zone, thinking about yourself (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> I</span>) and how much you love having things that are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> private</span> and just yours, when you realize there is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>) in this grain bag. And it's eating all of your (I's) private grains. No!
* The moral of the story is: don't let a sheep sneak into your private stash of things just for you (I). I'm sure this is a metaphor for something important...
