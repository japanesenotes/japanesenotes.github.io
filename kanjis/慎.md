## Mnemonics
 * When someone wants to view the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> reality</span> of your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> soul</span>, show it with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> humility</span>. Because the reality is... our souls are all a little dirty. And we haven't been the best versions we could be. So make sure when you show all of yourself you do so with some humility.
* Focus on the feeling of humility here. You're putting it all out there, you know? With nowhere to hide.
* As <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> humility</span> washes over you, you feel a shaking in your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shin</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しん](https://jisho.org/search/しん)</span>). Humility lives in your shins, so now they're shaking and trying to bring you down to the ground.
* Imagine humility literally moving through your shins. Can you still stand or do you need to fall to your shins, in humility?
