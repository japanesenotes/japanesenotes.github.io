## Mnemonics
 * What you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> street</span> needs to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> revise</span>d. Your words need to be polished, you can't publish improv. Revise your street word inspiration before you share it again.
* Think about all the stupid things you said on the streets today. Do you want those exact phrases, mistakes, and mouth sounds following you around forever? Revise it before you write it down!
* You want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> revise</span> the song you wrote about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ta</span>ter (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てい](https://jisho.org/search/てい)</span>) tots at lunch today. But it needs a lot of revising.
* Tater tots, tater tots, tater tots, man.<br />Bake me a tater tot as fast as you banana.<br />Well that's bad. Better revise this so it rhymes.<br />Tater tots, tater tots, tater tots, man.<br />Bake me a tater tot as fast as you want.<br />Nope, still bad. Revise!<br />Tater tots, tater tots, tater tots, man.<br />Bake me a tater tot as fast as you clam.<br />Yes. It's gold.
