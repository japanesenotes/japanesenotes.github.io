## Mnemonics
 * Between the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> and the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> there are <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> few</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span>. This is because we invited some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> VIP</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> guest</span>s into our home and they ate all our shellfish.
* The VIPs came into our home (the place between our roof and the ground) where they consumed all our shellfish. Only the best for guests, I guess.
* These <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> VIP</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> guest</span>s are part of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Hin</span>du (ひん) envoy. 
* We are treating these VIP guests extra special because they represent the whole Hindu religion. They get shellfish because of course we weren't going to serve them beef!
