## Mnemonics
 * There’s a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heaven</span> and you take a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> small</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> of water and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> append</span> it to the tsunami. Now the tsunami is big enough to destroy all of heaven. The small drop that you appended to the tsunami was just enough to push it over the edge, reaching full destruction capability.
* Take a small drop of water and append it to the tsunami. Feel the drop of water on your finger and visualize yourself flicking it at the tsunami as it races towards heaven.
* Just after you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> append</span> the small drop of water to the tsunami, it grows <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ten</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てん](https://jisho.org/search/てん)</span>) stories high. Before it was only nine, but since you appended that drop, the tsunami is now a full ten stories tall.
* Look up at this ten story tall tsunami. It looks big and powerful. Feel the water spray from the tsunami as it towers over you.
