## Mnemonics
 * There's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lid</span> on your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mustache</span>, covering up all your talking holes. This is because you kept saying how <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tall</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> expensive</span> you are.
* Imagine yourself saying how tall and expensive you are to everyone in the room. Then they use a lid to cover your mouth so you can't talk to anyone anymore. But, then your mustache starts talking, saying the same thing. That's why this lid covers both your mustache and your mouth. Now you can't say that you are tall or expensive.
* I am <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tall</span>er and more <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> expensive</span> than you. <br />You're saying this because there are some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>s in the room, and you want to make them feel inferior (you're a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> hater). You keep comparing your height to the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span>s in the room, and you keep checking price tags. Then you tell them you're taller and more expensive than they are.
* The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span>s finally get tired of your shenanigans, and lid up your mouth and mustache so you can't say that you're tall or expensive.
