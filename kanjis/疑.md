## Mnemonics
 * When you get home from school, your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mama</span> says to hang your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spoon</span>s and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> arrow</span>s on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> coat rack</span>. That doesn't sound like something your mama would say, and you begin to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> doubt</span> that she's your mama at all! She usually takes them and washes them in the sink. You doubt you could hang them on the coat rack even if you tried.
* Your mama is acting weird. You doubt she's really your mama. What are you going to do?
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> doubt</span> is growing really strong, so you decide to test your mama by putting her head in a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gui</span>llotine (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎ](https://jisho.org/search/ぎ)</span>)! Oh come on, don't feel bad, you're preeettty sure this isn't your real mama.
* Watch the doubt wash over her face as she looks up at you from her position in the guillotine. Finally she mutters, Well, this is disappointing, and I doubt you hung up your spoons and arrows on the coat rack before trying to murder your ol' mum.
