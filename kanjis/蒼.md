## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Flowers</span> grown in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> warehouse</span> will be very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pale</span>. They never see the sun, so they don't grow to have bright colors.
* Imagine walking into a warehouse and seeing hundreds of pale flowers growing in it. It's subtle, but beautiful.
* When you grow <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pale</span> flowers like this, they don't grow a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soul</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>). Soul adds color to plants and flowers. That's probably why ghosts and dead bodies are pale too.
* Picture a bunch of pale, soulless flowers. You pick one up and it falls apart in your hands.
