## Mnemonics
 * There’s an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> arrow</span> in that <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> and you do everything in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> power</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> recommend</span> that we don’t eat the turkey. There’s an arrow in this turkey. The arrow looks a little broken, so there’s probably splinters all up inside that turkey. I know you’re all hungry but I can’t recommend eating this bird.
* You can’t recommend this turkey. It’s probably dangerous. Imagine sending this turkey back in a restaurant, very upset with everything. Also keep in mind that the arrow is half buried in the turkey and looks a little broken since the arrow radical is a bit off.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> recommend</span> the Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>) special instead of this arrow-tainted turkey! When it comes out, your heart sinks. Genghis Khan apparently ate a cow with an arrow broken off in it.
* Welp, I guess if Genghis Khan recommends eating food with weapons still in them, you're okay with recommending it too. Eat up, everyone.
