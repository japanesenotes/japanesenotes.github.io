## Mnemonics
 * Just imagine a beast with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lid</span> for a head and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fins</span> for feet, running around looking as insane as possible (really imagine it!). When it runs up to you, it shows you the top of its lid-head. On it is written the numbers 666. Why? Because it's a spawn of the devil, and the number <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> six</span> is the devil's number.
* Imagine this beast doing various crazy things, the crazier the better (to help you remember). Make sure all these things are associated with the devil and the devil's number (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> six</span>), so you can remember the meaning of this kanji.
* Whenever we need to remember the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ろく](https://jisho.org/search/ろく)</span> we just use the word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rock</span>. <br />So, think about the devil and the devil's number. What is often associated with those things? Why, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ろく](https://jisho.org/search/ろく)</span>) and roll is. Imagine the lid-head fin-legged beast suddenly blasting out rock music in the middle of his destructive mayhem.
* Sing along with the monster, if it helps you to remember the reading of this kanji.
