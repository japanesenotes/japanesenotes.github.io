 * <div><div>A<strong>&nbsp;CURRICULUM</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<em>calendar</em>&nbsp;that replaces days with reasons to&nbsp;<em>stop</em>&nbsp;having fun.</div></div><div><div><i></i></div></div><br>You <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stop</span> at a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cliff</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> on it, realizing that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> continuation</span> is impossible unless you find some way to bridge the gap to the other side of the cliff. The tree seems long enough to reach to the other side, but how are you going to chop it down?<br>
* Imagine yourself on this cliff. You desire a continuation for your journey, not wanting to stop here. Feel the strong wind on your body, blowing your hair about as you stand on the edge of the cliff. The leaves on the tree rustle in the breeze.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Continuation</span> is impossible unless you chop this tree down to use as a bridge to cross to the other side of the cliff. You decide to use a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wrecki</span>ng (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れき](https://jisho.org/search/れき)</span>) ball. Luckily, there’s one right by you. So you take the wrecking ball and knock the tree over, making a bridge with it.
* Picture yourself using the wrecking ball to knock down the tree on the cliff. Hear the chug of the wrecking ball engine as the tree cracks and splinters from the force of the wrecking ball.
