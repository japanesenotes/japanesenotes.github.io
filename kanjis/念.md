## Mnemonics
 * If you live in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> now</span>, there’s a good chance your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span> controls your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thought</span> process. You don’t have time to think with your brain, you need an answer now so you use your heart to make decisions and thought process.
* Think about the last time you thought it was right to make a decision with your heart. What was it? Use these emotions to remember this kanji.
* You're living in the now and letting your heart control all your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thought</span>s. Why are you following your heart? You found you only have one <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [年](https://jisho.org/search/年)</span></span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ねん](https://jisho.org/search/ねん)</span>) to live, so you have to live for the now.
* Think of all the things you'd do with your life if you only had one <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [年](https://jisho.org/search/年)</span> left. Maybe you should go do some of them anyways, right now?
