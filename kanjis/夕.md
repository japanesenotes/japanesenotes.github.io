## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> evening</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> evening</span> kanji are the same. If you know the radical you know the meaning of the kanji.
* Do what you're meant to do. Study those radicals!
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> evening</span> is when all the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> you</span>ths (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆう](https://jisho.org/search/ゆう)</span>) come outside to play.
* Young people love staying up the entire evening doing youth-people things, and it's really obnoxious for us curmudgeonly folk.<br />Note: All the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆう](https://jisho.org/search/ゆう)</span> readings will use the word youths for the reading mnemonic. You can think of these youths as a group of younger people who cause a lot of the problems in this world, just like how people treat millennials nowadays.
