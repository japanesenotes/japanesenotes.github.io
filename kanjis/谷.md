## Mnemonics
 * There's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hat</span> decorated with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fins</span> and (presumably fish) <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span>s on it. Who wears strange hats like this? Turns out, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> valley</span> people are the ones who wear these. I'm talking about the Valley Girls of California, Hollywood / LA. They're into the crazy fashion, and they'll wear anything if it's deemed cool or something like that.
* Imagine a bunch of Valley Girls walking around with these strange hats. Fins and fish mouths... what a strange new fad.
* Hanging around with all the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Valley</span> Girls in the sunny area of LA is also a robot. It's WALL-E's distant (and lazy, lounging relative), <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> TAN-E</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たに](https://jisho.org/search/たに)</span>). He sits around getting a tan in LA with the Valley Girls while his cousin picks up trash.
* What a jerk he is. Imagine the deep tan lines on TAN-E as well. He's the epitome of robot laziness.
