## Mnemonics
 * If <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> someone</span> is holding <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span>, they're probably an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> author</span>. Authors really love flowers, because they help them think of flowery language they can use to sound smart in their books.
* <br />Imagine a time when a book you were reading used flowery language and you couldn't understand. Imagine the annoyance with the author for using words that are hard to understand
* Unfortunately, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> author</span> is allergic to flowers. They are only allergic to touching them though, so the author is holding the flowers with a pair of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cho</span>psticks (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょ](https://jisho.org/search/ちょ)</span>), really close to their face. Using the chopsticks, they can still use the flowers to think of fancy, author-ly words without touching them.
* Picture the author trying to use chopsticks to move around a little flower. It looks like they're having a hard time, but people will do anything to be a great author, I suppose.
