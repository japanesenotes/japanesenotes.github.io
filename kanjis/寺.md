## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> temple</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> temple</span> kanji are exactly the same! Brilliant.
* 
* Someone died. You ask how this person died, the person who's getting buried by the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> temple</span>. The priest/monk says it was in a tragic <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> terror</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てら](https://jisho.org/search/てら)</span>) attack.
* That's too bad - feel sorry for the person and learn a little more about the terror attack, if it will help you to remember the reading of this kanji better.
