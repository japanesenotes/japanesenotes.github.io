## Mnemonics
 * When climbing a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> public</span>, it’s best to choose a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pine</span>. Pine trees offer the most coverage, so you’ll be able to hide, even out in public.
* Imagine climbing up a pine tree. The pine needles are prickly, so your hands get pricked as you climb. Smell the pine tree smell and feel the pine sap on your hands.
* In case you fall, someone has laid <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mats</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まつ](https://jisho.org/search/まつ)</span>) out around the base of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pine</span> tree. That way, you’ll land on the mats should something unfortunate happen.
* Picture yourself falling out of this pine tree and onto the mats. The mats are nice and soft so it’s nice. Hear the whoosh of air as you collapse onto the mats.
