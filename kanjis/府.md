## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> canopy</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> attach</span>ing your entire country is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> government</span>. They loom over you all and try to keep you all organized and together under their control.
* Picture a map of the world with actual canopies attached to each government, representing the ruling governments of each place.
* Try to get out from under this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> government</span> canopy and you'll be labeled a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foo</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>). Unless... you can fool them!
* Think of all the people who've been labeled as fools by the government because they try to detach themselves from under their reach. It's a pretty long list...
