## Mnemonics
 * Setting up a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stand</span> on the top of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mountain</span>, you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rake</span> all the rocks to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> edge</span> of it. You want to clear the area around your stand, so you get your rake out and you rake all the stones and debris away from the stand and toward the edge of the mountain top. It also creates a small barrier around the edge as well.
* Imagine yourself at the top of the mountain, holding the rake in your hands. Look over the edge. Feel the sinking feeling in your stomach as you realize how high up you really are.
* You set up this stand at the top of the mountain so you could give a speech to the world. But you need to look your best, so you decide to get a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たん](https://jisho.org/search/たん)</span>). You lay next to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> edge</span> of the mountain, and prepare to tan. Everyone likes a person with a healthy tan.
* Imagine yourself at the edge of this mountain getting your tan on. Feel the sun beating down on you and feel the fresh mountain breeze blowing over your body. It’s very relaxing.
