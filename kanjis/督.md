## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Above</span> you, on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> small</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eye</span> of your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coach</span>. He's really high above you though, and all you can make out is the glint of his eye as he perches on that stool. But he's yelling out orders and corrections, which you can hear very well.
* Look up from the field or court and see the eye of your coach shining down and watching you closely. It makes you uncomfortable, honestly.
* You finally win the big game and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coach</span> is coming down off of his stool, and you see that's he's the ghost of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Toku</span>gawa (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とく](https://jisho.org/search/とく)</span>) Ieyasu!!! That explains why you could only ever make out his eyeball!
* Coach Tokugawa hovers before you, in full shougun garb, and nods his head in approval, winks, then disappears.
