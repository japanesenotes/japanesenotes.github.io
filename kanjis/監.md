## Mnemonics
 * To the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> servant</span> you say: <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gun</span>, <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span>, <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> plate</span>. It is your job to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> oversee</span> everything they do.
* You point to the gun. You point to the ground (that's where the gun goes). You point to the plate (you want it). You have to oversee everything the servant does.
* Why must you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> oversee</span> everything? Because you are Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>), and Genghis Khan oversees everything.
* If anyone had to oversee a lot, it was Genghis Khan, who had one of the largest kingdoms in all of history.
