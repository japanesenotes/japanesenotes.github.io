## Mnemonics
 * for women: PERIOD = PROBLEM<br><br>If you run into a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gate</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> first, you’re going to have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> problem</span>. Smashing your mouth into a gate is going to hurt. A lot. The problem you’re now in is one of getting to a hospital and having your mouth sewn back on.
* Imagine having your mouth bashed into a gate. It’s going to hurt. Imagine how painful this would be and how problematic it is.
* The reason you ran mouth first into this gate was because you were being chased by a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mon</span>ster (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もん](https://jisho.org/search/もん)</span>). A monster in and of itself is a big enough <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> problem</span> as is, let alone smashing your mouth into a gate. You poor, hapless soul.
* Monsters are scary. Maybe you’ve had a dream where you were being chased by one. Remember how scary that is when you see this kanji.
