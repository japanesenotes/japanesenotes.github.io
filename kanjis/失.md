## Mnemonics
 * That <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span> is your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> husband</span>'s only <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fault</span>. He loves that slide, more than you, and it's the only thing you don't like about him.
* Imagine looking out the window of your house and watching your husband slide down his slide over and over. He's not even good at it, he falls off the side halfway down most of the time. You want to complain, but he's pretty decent otherwise. This is his only fault.
* You try to come up with another <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fault</span> of his so you can complain when you see a tiny <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shih tzu</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しつ](https://jisho.org/search/しつ)</span>) trotting by. Oh no! Before you can call out, your husband has fallen off the slide and crushed the poor thing. You hear a sharp yelp and then nothing.
* You run outside and yell, AHA! It's your fault that shih tzu died! You and that stupid slide!
