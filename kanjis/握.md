## Mnemonics
 * You use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shop</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grip</span> what you want to buy.
* Imagine picking up a few different things in a shop. If something fits nicely in your grip: buy it. If it's too small or too big, put it back.
* You have a really strong <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grip</span> thanks to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> acu</span>puncture (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あく](https://jisho.org/search/あく)</span>)! All your fingers are primed for buying things. You can grip anything at a shop—pineapples, tires, even live turtles. All thanks to some well-placed needles.
* Acupuncture is great for strengthening your grip strength. If you do intense shopping (like I do) you should definitely consider it!
