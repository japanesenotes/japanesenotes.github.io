## Mnemonics
 * You need to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> allocate</span> enough <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gold</span> to buy a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gun</span>. Guns are weapons of the old world, so you can't just buy them with paper money. Guns have to be bought with gold coins and slabs and bricks.
* Picture yourself handing over an armful of gold bars to buy a single gun.
* You need this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gun</span> so you can steal some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> jew</span>els (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゅう](https://jisho.org/search/じゅう)</span>)! Why didn't you just use your gold to buy the jewels, you ask? Because! That's not how we did things in olden days. When you want jewels you buy a gun with gold and rob a jewelry store! 
* Picture an old fashioned hold up. You're holding a gun and shoveling jewels into a burlap sack. The heist of the century!
