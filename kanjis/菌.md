## Mnemonics
 * When you leave <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grain</span>s in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> for long enough, they'll turn into <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bacteria</span>. These aren't the nice, pretty flowers you'd give your mom on Mother's Day. These are little bacteria flowers that are taking over your mouth. Maybe brush your teeth next time.
* Imagine how much bacteria would flower in your mouth if you just left grains in there for like, I dunno, a month. That's a lot of nasty bacteria!
* There is a lot of this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bacteria</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kin</span>g (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きん](https://jisho.org/search/きん)</span>) of England's mouth. He eats a lot of grains, and he won't let anyone touch his mouth to clean it, but he refuses to do things himself... so it's absolutely chock full of bacteria.
* Picture the King's mouth up close. Look at all the bacteria squiggling around and through his teeth and gums. Bleh! Barf!
