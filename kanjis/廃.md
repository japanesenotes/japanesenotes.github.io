## Mnemonics
 * This <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> canopy</span>, after your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> departure</span>, will become <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> obsolete</span>. The canopy was here to protect you and your car, but no one will need it once you're gone.
* During your departure you look back at the obsolete canopy just once. It's standing there, still and alone. It's a really sad sight.
* When something becomes <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> obsolete</span>, you must write a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hai</span>ku (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はい](https://jisho.org/search/はい)</span>). Honestly, the best haiku are about something ending, so this is perfect.
* My sweet canopy<br />I don't need you anymore<br />You are obsolete
