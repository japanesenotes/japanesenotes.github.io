## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> well</span> will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> surround</span> you if you fall into it. The mouth of a well is the opening of the well, and if you fall into that well, the mouth as well as the rest of the well will surround you.
* Picture yourself surrounded by this well on all sides. You look up and you can barely see the mouth of the well where you fell in and now you are trapped. Imagine how scared you are. Imagine trying to claw your way up the sides of the well but all you do is break your nails on the walls.
* The well walls <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> surround</span> you as you look up to the mouth once again. This time you see an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>) flying overhead. You call out to the eagle to save you and the eagle comes swooping down into the well and flies you out to safety. What a nice eagle!
* This eagle is basically a superhero. Imagine an eagle dressed in a superman outfit. He’s your savior. Imagine your gratitude towards this eagle superhero.
