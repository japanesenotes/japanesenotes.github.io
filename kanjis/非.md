## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> criminal</span> has done an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> injustice</span> on the world or other people. Being a criminal is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> negative</span> thing, and even if it was just a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mistake</span>, it was still a crime.
* Think of all the criminals you know. Even if what they did was a mistake, it was still some type of injustice, right? It was something the rest of the world sees as a negative thing.
* When you commit an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> injustice</span>, you'll know because <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hea</span>t (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひ](https://jisho.org/search/ひ)</span>) fills your body. Maybe you've never done any kind of big thing, but when you make a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mistake</span> your face fills with heat and you turn red!
* This is the heat of embarrassment, of knowing you did something negative or wrong.
