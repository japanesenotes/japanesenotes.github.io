## Mnemonics
 * People who <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> loiter</span> around the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> temple</span> are probably just trying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wait</span>. They don't mean to look like they're up to no good, but it's hard to wait without looking suspicious when you're waiting outside a temple.
* Imagine waiting outside a temple. People are giving you looks. People think you're loitering, not just waiting innocently.
* As you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wait</span> outside the temple, you can't help but adjust your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tie</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たい](https://jisho.org/search/たい)</span>). When you wait you get nervous, and when you get nervous you fidget. So now you're messing with your tie a whole bunch.
* Imagine adjusting your tie as you wait. Oh no, now even more people are staring at you. The tie thing is making you look even more suspicious!
