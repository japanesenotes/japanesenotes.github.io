## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> that wash up on shore in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span>s that we make into <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> syrup</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seaweed</span>. Okay, so it's more like soup or tea than syrup, but you can make them both out of seaweed.
* Seaweed is the flower of the sea!
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Seaweed</span> is true <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>) food. Which means it's good for your soul. Didn't you ever read those books about chicken soup being good for your soul? Well that was a lie. Miso soup with seaweed is what's really good for your soul.
* Feed your soul with seaweed and it will thank you. Promise! &lt;3
