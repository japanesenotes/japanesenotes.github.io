## Mnemonics
 * A pile of shitty kanjis with a flower on top = art<br><br><br>There are fake <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> at your feet and fake <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> clouds</span> above you because you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> acting</span>.
* Imagine acting in a play or a movie where there are flowers and clouds all around you. You're singing and smiling and dancing and acting your absolute heart out!
* You have to do some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> acting</span> that involves you being <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gay</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [げい](https://jisho.org/search/げい)</span>). You should imagine this scene, whether you're gay and it's not actual acting or not.
* Maybe you'll love it, maybe you'll hate it. Whatever happens, feel that emotion well up, as the flowers and clouds spin around you, and you act out the scene.
