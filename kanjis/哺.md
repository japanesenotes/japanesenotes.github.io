## Mnemonics
 * After your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> wedding</span> you have a baby and it uses its <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nurse</span> from your post-marriage boobs. Yes, babies nurse from breasts. Get over it, kids.
* You waited until your wedding to have your baby and all it seems to do with its mouth is want to nurse. It doesn't cry, which is nice, but it doesn't laugh or talk either.
* The baby wants to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nurse</span> all day and the only thing you can seem to do at the same time is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hoe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほ](https://jisho.org/search/ほ)</span>) your garden. You hold the baby to your breast with one arm and hoe little rows with the other. It's actually a great workout and a nice way to spend time!
* This hoe has really helped you get through nursing. You think you'll keep this up even after your baby is weened off! Hoeing the garden is your new favorite hobby!
