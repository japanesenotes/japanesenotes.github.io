## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> of rain falls on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bear</span> leaning up against a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> stuck into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mound</span>. The drop wakes the bear up and he rolls down off the mound. After the bear rights himself, he assumes that the cross pushed him off the mound so he charges into the cross atop the mound and knocks it over.
* Imagine this whole scene. A drop of water rouses the bear and he becomes enraged after he rolls down the mound. Hear the bear roar with anger as he charges up the mound and violently smashes the cross into the ground.
* Once the bear fully wakes up he realizes that he just rolled down the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mound</span> on his own and the cross was not to blame. What a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foo</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>) this bear was. He knows it too. The bear feels pretty foolish.
* Now look at the bear sitting atop the mound with his head in his paws, looking like a fool filled with regret. This bear feels like a fool for attacking the cross like he did.
