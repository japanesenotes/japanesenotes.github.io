## Mnemonics
 * If you want to take a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span> out of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mantis</span> you have to make a formal <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> request</span> first. Mantises don't like to just give things away, and they're kind of mean so if you try to steal the flag it will probably bite you. So make a formal, polite request if you want it.
* Imagine trying to request a flag from a scary mantis that has it sitting in it's mouth. Will it give it to you? Will it bite you? You'll have to wait and see.
* After you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> request</span> the mantis give you its flag it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shock</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょく](https://jisho.org/search/しょく)</span>) you by actually spitting it out of its mouth at your feet. You didn't think your request would work, or even if the mantis understood human speech, but it shocked you by doing exactly what you asked!
* Imagine your shock at finding out the mantis not only understood your request, but agreed! This is great but also makes you wonder what other creatures can understand you...
