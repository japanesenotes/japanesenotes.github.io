## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Say</span> it with your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tongue</span>. If you do, you'll be able to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> talk</span>. You'll be able to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> speak</span>.
* Your problem is you weren't saying it with your tongue before. Once you start using your tongue, you're able to speak suddenly!
* If something uses their tongue, it will be able to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> talk</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> speak</span>. To prove this, you teach a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wa</span>lrus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わ](https://jisho.org/search/わ)</span>) to use its tongue, and lo and behold, it speaks to you!
* You decided to teach a walrus how to speak because it seemed like the hardest thing to teach, with its tusks and all that. It turned out to be really easy. Although, you may have picked the Justin Long walrus, by accident. Either way, this walrus can speak! And you definitely (probably) helped.
