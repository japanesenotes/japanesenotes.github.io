## Mnemonics
 * You're in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> prison</span> and all you have is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spoon</span>. You use that prison spoon to scoop up nice <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scent</span>s and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fragrance</span>s out of the air when you have outdoor time and bring them back into your cell.
* It smells really bad in prison, but your prison spoon is full of all of the lovely scents you remember from when you were free.
* You can't remember what any of these <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scent</span>s are anymore, you've been in prison for so long, so you call them all <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neo</span>-scents (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にお](https://jisho.org/search/にお)</span>). They're neo, they're new.
* Try to come with some neo-scents right now. This is neo-laundry, this is neo-flowers, and this is neo-delicious-steak I'll never get to eat because I'm in prison sniffing a spoon.
