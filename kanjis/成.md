## Mnemonics
 * When a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span> holds a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sword</span> it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> becomes</span> something else. The drunkard doesn't become a swordsman, they're still just a drunkard. But the sword in their hands does.
* Picture the drunkard standing in front of you. He picked up the sword and is holding it above his head. It's becoming... becoming...
* The sword has <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> become</span> a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sa</span>ber (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せい](https://jisho.org/search/せい)</span>)! It's just like the saber you have! Hey, wait.
* If a sword becomes a saber in the hands of a drunkard... then what are you? Geez this became pretty deep.<br />You slice down the drunkard with your saber and become a little more depressed than you were before.
