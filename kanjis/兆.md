## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> omen</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> omen</span> kanji are the same!
* If you know the omen radical, you know the omen kanji as well!
* You listen to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> omen</span>, in it, it tells of an event in the future when Mrs. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chou</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょう](https://jisho.org/search/ちょう)</span>) will destroy the world.
* You can clarify with the person telling you the omen several things: Do you believe in the omen about Mrs. Chou destroying the world? When will this omen about Mrs. Chou come true? etc. As long as you're associating omen with Mrs. Chou you should be good, so keep harping on that.<br />Anyway, whenever you hear any kind of omen (omen is a radical in the kanji), there's a good chance it's going to be about Mrs. Chou.
