## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Viking</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> see</span>, Viking <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> memorize</span>. That’s how Vikings learn things. They see something, and then they memorize it. Quite simple, really.<br />It can also mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> awake</span>. Just remember that a viking can't see if it isn't awake. There won't be anything to memorize if their eyes are still closed, after all!
* How else would a Viking memorize something? Imagine having to memorize sea charts for your Viking navigation. Look and see the maps in your brain as you memorize them.
* Every morning, a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かく](https://jisho.org/search/かく)</span>) crows and rouses the Vikings. Seeing this, one of the Vikings <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> memorize</span>s the cock crow so that he can mimic it and play pranks on his fellow Vikings.
* Imagine yourself memorizing the sound of a cock crow and using it to play jokes on your fellow Vikings. Cock-a-doodle-doo!
