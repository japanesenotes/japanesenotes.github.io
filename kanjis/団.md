## Mnemonics
 * Use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> to take a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> measurement</span> of this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> group</span>. Just stretch your mouth out and around every single person. Get 'em all in there.
* I hope this group is full of people who enjoy being inside someone else's mouth, because they're gonna be pretty mad when you let them out if they aren't.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> group</span> is so big it takes you till <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dawn</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だん](https://jisho.org/search/だん)</span>) to get your measurement: they weigh a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ton</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とん](https://jisho.org/search/とん)</span>) too!
* Imagine letting this group of, now very wet, people out of your mouth one by one. They don't seem to care that they weigh a ton! That's a large measurement, they should be proud.
