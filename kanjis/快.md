## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> soul</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> person</span> has a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hook</span> that can make them <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pleasant</span>. When you see, hear, or feel something pleasant, can't you feel that hook pressing into the middle of your body?
* Imagine that feeling you get when everything is just SO pleasant. There is a pressure from your soul's hook digging in. It's a good feeling though, a pleasant one! It isn't too hard or too soft.
* If you want to feel this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pleasant</span> feeling just look at a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ka</span>yak (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かい](https://jisho.org/search/かい)</span>). Kayaks are the most pleasant boats in the world. Feel that pleasant feeling in your chest just from reading about kayaks in this mnemonic right now.
* Go look up pictures of kayaks to get some of that pleasant high. Mm, your soul is hooking you real good.
