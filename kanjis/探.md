## Mnemonics
 * If you want to get your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> pi</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span>, you're going to have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> look for</span> it. This isn't a tree made of pie, or growing fully-baked pies. It's a pi tree, one that exists infinitely. It's the most rare tree in the world. And if you want to stick your fingers in it, you have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> search for it</span>, far and wide!
* Imagine it like a quest from a book or movie. You have a band of travelers, and you're all out searching for it together!
* You try to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> look for</span> the pi tree for so long that you can't help but get a very deep <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たん](https://jisho.org/search/たん)</span>). You can't search for anything inside, and you definitely can't find the pi tree inside, so you spend a lot of time outside in the bright sun.
* Feel the sun's rays on your skin as you search and search and search for the tree. Watch as your skin gets darker, crispier, and hmm, smells like cooked meats. Now that's a good tan.
