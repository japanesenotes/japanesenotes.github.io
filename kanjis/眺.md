## Mnemonics
 * When your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eye</span> catches an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> omen</span>, it's only natural that you will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stare</span> at it. 
* You don't see omens that often, so of course you're going to stare. We'll imagine what the omen is in the reading mnemonic.
* As you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stare</span> at the omen, you see Mrs. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chou</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょう](https://jisho.org/search/ちょう)</span>) knocking down buildings, putting nails on the street, and making herself way longer than you ever thought possible. Oh, and there she is, destroying the world.
* Whenever you see an omen (radical), remember that the omen will probably have Mrs. Chou in it!
