## Mnemonics
 * Your nation's <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span> sits on top of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cape</span>d <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span>. This is the symbol for the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Bureau</span> of Secret Things. It's a special <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> department</span> of your government made to keep things hidden.
* The cape covering the mouth represents how this bureau never talks about their secrets. The flag represents your country. Think about all the cool secret things the Bureau of Secret Things must have.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bureau</span>'s best-kept secret is cloaking devices that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cloak you</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょく](https://jisho.org/search/きょく)</span>) with the press of a button.
* Now, this mnemonic isn’t perfectly close, but the goal is to get you close enough in your brain so that you can remember <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょく](https://jisho.org/search/きょく)</span> later. If you can get to CLOAK YOU, then you can get to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょく](https://jisho.org/search/きょく)</span> much easier than just trying to get there from scratch. So imagine working in this bureau and getting to cloak yourself all the time.
