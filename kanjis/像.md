## Mnemonics
 * In india, they have statues of ELEPHANT LEADERS everywhere.<br><br>The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> elephant</span>s was so great, they made a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> statue</span> of him. This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> image</span> of him looks down on all the other elephants at all times.
* For now, just imagine the leader of the elephants being told they're getting a statue. Don't think about what the statue looks like, because that's next.
* When they unveil the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> statue</span> of the leader elephant, everyone gasps. It's a statue of the leader, but they are a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> zo</span>mbie (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぞう](https://jisho.org/search/ぞう)</span>). Gasp!
* But this is exactly what the leader of the elephants asked for. For you see, the leader of the elephants was a big fan of zombies. Imagine the elephant leader being so excited to have a zombie version of the statue.
