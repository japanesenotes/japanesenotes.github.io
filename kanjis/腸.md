## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> easy</span> tonight, so you decide to cut it open. But, the moon wasn't the moon, it was your big, pale, round tummy. You just cut it open, and now you can see your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> intestines</span>.
* Imagine the moon, then imagine it cross-fading into your big, round tummy. Then, cut it open because you think the moon is easy to cut. And finally, see your intestines as clearly as you can.
* All over the world, people are cutting their bellies open, because they think its an easy moon (versus a normal moon, or hard moon, presumably). This is because they have fallen victim to a spell by Mrs. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chou</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょう](https://jisho.org/search/ちょう)</span>).
* This scene was in all the omen radicals you've been seeing about her. If only you could have stopped her, then none of this would have happened, right? Perhaps it was all destiny, you think, as your intestines fall from your stomach and Mrs. Chou cackles over your weakening body.
