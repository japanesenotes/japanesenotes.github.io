## Mnemonics
 * If you play <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> blackjack</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span>, your cards will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scatter</span> everywhere. The cards scatter because the gravity is so weak on the moon, so the blackjack game is prone to disaster.
* Imagine playing blackjack on the moon where even the slightest move causes the cards to scatter about. Watch them float along. It’s very frustrating to play this way.
* You are playing blackjack with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> San</span>ta-san (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さん](https://jisho.org/search/さん)</span>). Santa-san is doing his best to use his Christmas magic to prevent the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scatter</span> of cards, but it’s not working out so well. Good effort, Santa-san.
* Imagine yourself next to Santa-san as he tries to prevent the cards from scattering. Look at the expression of concentration on Santa-san’s face as he tries to prevent the scatter.
