## Mnemonics
 * On this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> there is an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eye</span> inside a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span> that was drawn trying to express some sort of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> concept</span>. Unfortunately, concepts like this, especially concept art, has never been your strong suit.
* You sit down in front of the tree with its eye heart and stare at it, trying to understand the concept it's trying to express. Concepts are too abstract. This is hard.
* After a few hours of contemplating this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> concept</span>, suddenly it becomes clear and a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>) pops out of the tree. It leans forward and touches your forehead and your head fills with new concepts and ideas you've never considered before.
* The soul of the tree or symbol or whoever granted the ability to understand complicated concepts to YOUR soul. Groovy.
