## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Big</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> products</span> need to be put in a big <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> container</span>. A small container just won’t do. These products are big and they need a big container to be contained in.
* Imagine having all these big products. How will you contain them all!? Imagine yourself stuffing all of these big products into their respective containers.
* Once you get the big products into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> container</span>, you then lock it with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>). You wouldn’t want these products to bust out of their containers, so it’s best to lock them up with a key.
* Imagine the size of these big keys you have to use to lock these containers. It’s a really big key. Picture yourself straining to turn the key in the lock.
