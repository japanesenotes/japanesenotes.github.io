## Mnemonics
 * If you see <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> icicle</span>s hanging off of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> samurai</span>'s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> clothes</span>, don't worry, those are just part of his winter <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attire</span>. Samurai have to travel and fight in all sorts of conditions, so it only makes sense that they have attire for every season.
* Picture a samurai in his winter attire. His helmet is white and fuzzy and he has decorative icicles hanging down off of his armor.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Attire</span> like this is important because it reflects your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soul</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>). The samurai is wearing clothing with icicles because that's how his heart feels too: frozen over because he has to fight in this horrible winter weather.
* Picture the kind of attire you'd wear as a samurai to reflect your soul. Mine would be bright pink and covered in horses and bananas and daisies to show that I have a happy, kind soul and that I don't want to be killed by anyone else.
