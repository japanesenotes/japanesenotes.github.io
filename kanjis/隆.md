## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span> in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> will allow <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> life</span> to have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prosperity</span>. Before we had buildings it was impossible to have any prosperity in winter because everything was cold and most of us died. 
* Picture a dark, bleak winter landscape. No life anywhere. Now turn around and look at the prosperity on display in the building you're in. Everyone is happy and eating food and not freezing to death.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prosperity</span> isn't good for everyone though. You look over and see Ryu (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りゅう](https://jisho.org/search/りゅう)</span>) from Street Fighter sitting in the corner. He's got everything he could ask for. He's won the tournament, he's got money, he's got this nice big building, but now he's depressed.
* Ryu's prosperity has made him realize that having things isn't always enough. Now he's looking wistfully outside at the winter weather, missing the rough times.
