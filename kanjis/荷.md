## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lip ring</span> wearing <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Flowers</span> Gang does not carry his own <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> luggage</span> anywhere. He is so powerful, respected, and feared that people always carry his luggage for him wherever he goes. You might not think a leader of a gang called the Flowers would be intimidating, but he is.
* Picture this lip ring wearing gang leader. He’s clad in studded leather and has a big flower embroidered onto the back of his jacket. It’s a big thorny rose. Imagine him in your head, hear the sound of his leather outfit as he strides along unencumbered by luggage.
* Remember that giant thorny rose on the lip ring wearing leader’s back? The thorns coming out of it are real, and they’re as sharp as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nee</span>dles (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [に](https://jisho.org/search/に)</span>). You wouldn’t want to prick your finger on them. They’re super pointy and he uses them to defend his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> luggage</span>.
* Imagine how much it hurts to get pricked by a needle, especially on your finger. Picture this happening to you now. Not comfortable, is it?
