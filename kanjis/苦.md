## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Old</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suffering</span> because they're old.
* Old things go through a lot of suffering because their bodies are breaking down. Flowers are no different from you and me.
* If an old flower (or person) is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suffering</span>, give them a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coo</span>kie (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [く](https://jisho.org/search/く)</span>).
* No one can resist a good cookie. It will ease your suffering, or at least distract you for a little bit.
