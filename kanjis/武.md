## Mnemonics
 * On the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> there's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ceremony</span> where everyone keeps <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stop</span>ping. This stopping ceremony is being performed by the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> military</span>. They'll march one direction, then stop and turn, then march another direction, then stop again.
* The military really seems to have a thing for stopping a lot during their ceremonies.
* You look closer at the people in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> military</span> and realize that every time they stop they take a drink of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boo</span>ze (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶ](https://jisho.org/search/ぶ)</span>)!
* This is a ceremony for celebrating the military so I guess they can drink as much booze as they want, but this seems very strange to you.
