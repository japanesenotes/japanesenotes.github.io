## Mnemonics
 * You need to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stop</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span> from going down a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> jackhammer</span> to ask him how many <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> years old</span> he is. He's doing a lot of dangerous things right now, and they all have age limits.
* Depending how many years old he is, this guy could be violating like three different laws right now.
* When you ask him how many <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> years old</span> he is, he turns to you and screams, I'M A MILLION YEARS OLD AND YOU'LL NEVER STOP ME! That's obviously not how old this kid is, so you take out your holy blue <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sa</span>ber (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せい](https://jisho.org/search/せい)</span>) and slice the slide in half. Then the jackhammer. Then the kid's metal arm—wait! This kid is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cy</span>borg (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さい](https://jisho.org/search/さい)</span>)!
* Your saber cuts through the cyborgs robo-body and it screams, OKAY OKAY I'M NOT A MILLION I'M ONLY FIVE YEARS OLD AND A CYBORG PLEASE DON'T REPROGRAM ME!
