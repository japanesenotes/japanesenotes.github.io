## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Slide</span> some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> on your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> legs</span> so you can feel like you're from a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> previous</span> time. Everything from the past is in the dirt. Dead people, dinosaur bones, your mom's secrets in a box from her past life. All these things come back to you as you slide the dirt all over your legs.
* Imagine the feeling of dirt on your legs. Now think back to the previous day. The previous year. The previous century.
* As you sit there, pretending you're in a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> previous</span> time you see a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cen</span>taur (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span>)! That's right! Centaurs are from wayyyy in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> past</span>.
* Centaurs were definitely real in the past. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. They're just afraid of the truth.
