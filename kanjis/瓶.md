## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lantern</span> with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span> that can hold <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ten thousand</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span>s of water is sitting on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span>. You get closer and realize it's not a lantern, it's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bottle</span>. It's got horns, and a weird handle, but it's definitely a bottle with water inside of it.
* Picture this horned bottle sitting on the ground. You don't know who left it here or why, but it's here and the weirdest looking bottle you've ever seen.
* Even though you're not the one who left this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bottle</span> here, you decide to do the right thing and throw it in the trash <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bin</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [びん](https://jisho.org/search/びん)</span>). It's not right to leave a bottle just sitting on the ground, you know.
* Imagine picking up this weird bottle with your bare hands and putting it in a trash bin. You did your good deed for today! Yay!
