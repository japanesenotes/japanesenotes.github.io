* It's a religion building. They have a lot of different names, churches, mosques, temples, cathedrals, but none of those matter. All that matters is that you really drill whichever religion you want into the heads of the people who come under your roof.
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> religion</span> requires everyone to take off their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shoe</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅう](https://jisho.org/search/しゅう)</span>). Mostly because the shoes will help them resist the jackhammering, so you tell them that to join your religion they have to leave their shoes at the door.
* Picture the pile of shoes left outside. If you see a bunch of shoes like this you can be sure there's a religious place around here.
