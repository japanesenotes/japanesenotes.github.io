## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> hits a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> valley</span>, filling it up with water. Lucky for you, you're a giant, so you just lay down in the valley and use it to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bathe</span>.
* Sure, there's a lot of water in the valley, but you're big too. It's the perfect place for you to bathe... and good thing too, you're getting smelly.
* You know what would make the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bath</span>ing experience even better? If you had some egg <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yolk</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よく](https://jisho.org/search/よく)</span>) to eat. Just crack those yolks into the water you bathe in, and it'll cook to perfection. Yum!
* Imagine cooking egg yolks in the same water you bathe in.
