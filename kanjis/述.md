## Mnemonics
 * On this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span>, there's an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> angel</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> of sweat coming off of it, because it forgot to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mention</span> something to you! It seems like it's something important too, since they're sweating so much.
* The angel just visited you, but it forgot to mention something important (probably life-threatening, it's an angel after all), and now you see it scooting at top speeds toward you.
* I forgot to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mention</span>, you have to study nin<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> jutsu</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゅつ](https://jisho.org/search/じゅつ)</span>)! the angel yells. But it's too late, there are ninjas jumping out of the bushes around you and taking you hostage.
* The angel really should have mentioned ninjutsu earlier. Then maybe you would have gone straight to a dojo to learn instead of falling into a ninjutsu trap yourself. The angel definitely failed its mission.
