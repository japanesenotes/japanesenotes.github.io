## Mnemonics
 * When you're at your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cottage</span> the only thing you do with your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> throw away</span> things. The cottage is for vacation. And vacation means being as lazy as possible. But you certainly don't want to live in filth, so you have to throw away your trash at least.
* Imagine sitting in your cottage. You throw away a banana peel. You throw away some used sun tan lotion. You throw away all your cares in the world.
* The number one thing you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> throw away</span> while in your cottage is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> su</span>it (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span>). Suits just don't fit the cottage life vibe, man. 
* Just throw away all your suits when you want to relax. Don't worry about needing one some day, throw it awaaaay!
