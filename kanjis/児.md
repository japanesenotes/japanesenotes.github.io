## Mnemonics
 * Pointing your magic solar powered wishing <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stick</span> at the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span>, you attain the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> legs</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> child</span>. You’re old and want young legs to carry you around, so you took your wishing stick that’s powered by the sun, and you wished for the legs of a child.
* Imagine yourself getting new legs. Legs that belong to a child. They’re limber and young and full of energy! Feel your legs of a child underneath you!
* As you delight in your new legs, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Je</span>sus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span>) descends from the sky. “My <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> child</span>,” he says, “why have you pointed the stick at the sun and wished for the legs of a child? You were already perfect, just as all of God’s children are perfect.”
* Say back to Jesus, “I’m not your child Jesus! And you’re just jealous of my new legs! You wish you had the legs of a child, Jesus! Your legs are like super old!” Actually say this out loud, and remember how Jesus wishes he could be a child again too.
