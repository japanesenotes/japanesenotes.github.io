## Mnemonics
 * You hoist your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> towel</span> above your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> table</span>, <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> into the water and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sail</span> away. You turned the towel into an actual sail and you're balancing on top of the table, which is now a boat.
* Imagine sailing out into the open sea, drops of water hitting your face, as the towel sail catches the air and carries you away.
* As you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sail</span> off into the ocean you hear a familiar voice shout out, Ahoy! <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Han</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はん](https://jisho.org/search/はん)</span>) Solo calls. He's also got a towel sail, but it's on the Millennium Falcon, which is half-submerged in the water.
* You sail nervously past Han Solo who also seems to be sailing, though in worse shape than you. But he keeps throwing you finger guns so you figure it's best to just sail on and pretend this never happened.
