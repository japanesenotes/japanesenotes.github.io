## Mnemonics
 * You're in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tent</span> eating <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> beans</span> because you're trying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> climb</span> a mountain! When you climb, you sleep in a tent and eat only beans (the ultimate climbing food).
* Imagine climbing slowly and carefully up a cliff on the side of this mountain. Your tent and your beans are tied to your back, and you're letting out little farts with each step from all the beans you've been consuming.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> climb</span> and climb and climb until you finally reach... <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とう](https://jisho.org/search/とう)</span></span><span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょう](https://jisho.org/search/きょう)</span>! At the top of this mountain you've been climbing you can see all of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とう](https://jisho.org/search/とう)きょう</span>. It's beautiful! It's breathtaking! All your climbing makes this view of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とう](https://jisho.org/search/とう)きょう</span> even more worthwhile!
* Oh, what was the name of the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とう](https://jisho.org/search/とう)きょう</span> mountain you just worked so hard to climb? Mount Takao. (You should go climb it with your real body and see <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とう](https://jisho.org/search/とう)きょう</span> with your real eyes sometime!)
