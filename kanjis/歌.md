## Mnemonics
 * If you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lack</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lip ring</span> (or two in this case) it's going to make it way easier for you to sing a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> song</span>.
* Imagine a song with lip rings. Then imagine one without. Sing them, pretending you have lip rings. It doesn't work as well.
* You're singing a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> song</span> with all these lip rings in your mouth and you sound terrible. You're on the side of the road singing. People are freaking out. Finally, someone drives into you with their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>).
* Imagine yourself getting hit by this car. All the air flies out of you as you sing your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> song</span>. You think I shouldn't have tried to sing a song with all these lip rings...
