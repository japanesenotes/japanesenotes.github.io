 * Sitting safely under your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> canopy</span> you take <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span>, mix it up, and create unique <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cosmetics</span> for your face.
* Imagine mixing dirt and rice together to make some cosmetics that best fit your skin tone and type. No one will see you doing it under this canopy too, so the secret formula you come up with will be safe.
* You need these <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cosmetics</span> because you have a meeting with the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>) coming up. You want to impress him, and you don't want anyone to copy your look.
* Imagine meeting the Shougun with your new cosmetics all over your face. You look amazing! Stunning! The shougun wants to know where you got that foundation, you're glowing!
