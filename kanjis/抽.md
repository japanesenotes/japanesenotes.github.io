## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> give you a good <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> reason</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pluck</span> things. You pluck flowers out of the ground. You pluck a cat out of a tree. Why? Because you have fingers! That's your reason.
* Imagine using your fingers to pluck grapes and apples and other things, maybe non-fruit things.
* Now that you have a reason to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pluck</span> things (you have fingers, after all) you decide you want to pluck all the fur off of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chew</span>bacca (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちゅう](https://jisho.org/search/ちゅう)</span>). He is very furry, and you want to know what he looks like under there.
* What reason could you have for wanting to pluck the fur off Chewbacca? Because you have fingers! So why not?!
