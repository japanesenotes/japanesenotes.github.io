## Mnemonics
 * There’s a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span>, so the things you say are very pious. Everything you say you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> say humbly</span>.
* Imagine yourself with a cross in your mouth, saying all kinds of humble things. Oh no, I'm not that good. Oh no, my mustache doesn't look that great.
* When you think of saying humble things, think of the humblest man in the world. His name is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Moe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もう](https://jisho.org/search/もう)</span>).
* Imagine this character in your head. If it helps, you can take a Moe you already know of (Simpsons, perhaps?) and pretend he's extremely humble - ridiculously so. Just remember to make it crazy so you can remember it better.
