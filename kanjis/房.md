## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> door</span> in that <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> direction</span> is among a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cluster</span> of doors. You run in the direction of the cluster and one door stands out to you. You enter it.
* Imagine seeing all these doors, this cluster of doors. You feel confused at which one to enter but finally pick one. Hear the door creak as you open it.
* After you make it through the door, you come across another <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cluster</span> of doors. Which one to choose? There's a loud thunderous sound coming from behind one and you decide to open it. Behind it, there's an entire <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bow</span>ling (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼう](https://jisho.org/search/ぼう)</span>) alley and people bowling, loudly!
* Watch as clusters of pins fall when the bowling balls hit them. You back up and peek through one of the other doors in the cluster and it also houses a bowling alley. Huh.
