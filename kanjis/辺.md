## Mnemonics
 * While riding your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span>, you take your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sword</span> and cut out an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> area</span> on the ground. This whole place is your area now!
* Imagine riding your scooter around in a really large circle, pressing your sword into the ground as you do. Once you close the circle, you claim to everyone around that this is YOUR area, and they aren't allowed in.
* As you look down at your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> area</span>, you suddenly realize there is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hen</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [へん](https://jisho.org/search/へん)</span>) pecking at the ground in there. Um, excuse me, hen, I believe I said this is MY area?! You try to kick it out, but it hops over your leg.
* Imagine doing everything you can to get this hen out of your area, but it manages to dodge and outwit you at every turn. You even slash at it with your sword and try to run it over with your scooter, but the hen can't be stopped. This is the hen's area now. You have been defeated.
