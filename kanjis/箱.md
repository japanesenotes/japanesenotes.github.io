## Mnemonics
 * Having a keen <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eye</span> for woodworking, you can tell that the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bamboo</span> from that <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> over there will make an excellent <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> box</span>. Boxes made from bamboo trees are very sturdy and fashionable. You have an eye for fashion as well, you see.
* At some point in school, you most likely had some sort of woodshop class to take. Remember back to those times and imagine yourself crafting a bamboo box out of a bamboo tree you felled yourself. Don’t forget to wear eye protection though! Wouldn’t want anything to happen to those valuable eyes of yours.
* While working on your wooden <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> box</span> you hear a strange cry from above. You look up and see an angry <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hawk</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はこ](https://jisho.org/search/はこ)</span>) flying overhead. Oh no! That bamboo you cut down must have been where the hawk lived. Imagine finishing up the box, climbing up some bamboo and tying the box securely up there as a replacement home for the hawk.
* Picture the hawk landing in the box and grumpily trying to stuff it full of straw and twigs. At least your beautiful box will be put to good use.
