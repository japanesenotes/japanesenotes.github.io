## Mnemonics
 * If you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> loiter</span> around a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> surplus</span> of anything, you need to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gentle</span> and touch everything <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gently</span>. 
* Unfortunately it's not specific as to what kind of surplus you're loitering around, so you'll need to imagine a surplus of something memorable to you. Then, just imagine loitering around there, being really gentle with everything.
* You have to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gentle</span> and handle these things <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gently</span> because they belong to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Jo</span>-Anne (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょ](https://jisho.org/search/じょ)</span>). You're loitering around her surplus of (whatever you decided to imagine).
* Imagine Jo-Anne coming back to her surplus, then asking you if you were gentle with the goods. You were, you treated everything very gently.
