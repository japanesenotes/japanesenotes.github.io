## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Construction</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> leads to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> aggression</span>. Just think about it. It's cold, it's unpleasant, and you don't want to be there. So, you start to develop an aggression towards other people working with you on this winter project.
* Imagine yourself walking through the winter construction site, taking out your aggression on anyone you see. You hate this winter construction!
* You're taking your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> aggression</span> out on everyone. Then, the sexy construction worker from WaniKani Level 1, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>, walks by without a shirt on. You take out all your aggression on him.
* Aggression is going to depend on you, so you should imagine a scene where you take your aggression out on <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち]([こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち)</span>, whatever that entails.<br />Hint: When you see <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [工](https://jisho.org/search/工)</span> in a kanji it will often take the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)</span> reading.
