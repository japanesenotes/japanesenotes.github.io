## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> simple</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> simple</span> kanji are the same!
* Simple is simple!
* One of the most <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> simple</span> things in the world is getting a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たん](https://jisho.org/search/たん)</span>). All you have to do it stand outside long enough. It doesn't matter what skin type you have or what the weather is like. Eventually, if you stand out there long enough, you'll get a tan.
* Get a tan, it's simple, stupid! (Though it's terrible for you so uh... don't always take our advice, kay?)
