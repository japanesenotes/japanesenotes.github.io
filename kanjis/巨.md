## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> giant</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> giant</span> kanji are exactly the same! Massive!
* 
* Just recently, a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> giant</span> rampaged through Little <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kyo</span>to (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょ](https://jisho.org/search/きょ)</span>), so now it's even smaller than before. Poor Little Kyoto.
* See Little Kyoto after the giant rampaged through it. It looks even smaller and more pathetic than ever. Look at all the smoldering rubble and smell the smoke with your nose.
