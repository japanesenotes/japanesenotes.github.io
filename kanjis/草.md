## Mnemonics
 * You plant your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> in the light of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> in the shape of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span>, but it's too hot—the sun is too strong—and you end up with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grass</span>. Flowers can't grow in these conditions.
* Think of how disappointed you are. You wanted a beautiful cross of flowers, and now you just have a big overgrown patch of thick grass. It isn't even pretty green grass, it's a little brown and damaged from the sun.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grass</span> on top is brown and burned from the sun, so you need to take a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cool saw</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くさ](https://jisho.org/search/くさ)</span>) and hack the tops off. The saw is actually physically cool to the touch, to help heal the grass' sunburned bits. It just happens to look cool too.
* Imagine using your cool saw to saw off the heads of all of this grass. You made the cross pretty big, so there is a ton of grass to get through. The sun is beating down on you and the grass too, which isn't making it any easier.
