## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> crashes into the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> (breaking it in half) and creating a different <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> wing</span> of the tsunami all together. This wing crashes down and creates a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lagoon</span>.
* The lagoon is beautiful! The water is hot (from hitting the sun) but it isn't so bright that you'll get a sunburn.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lagoon</span> was created on purpose by a really angry dude and his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cata</span>pult (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かた](https://jisho.org/search/かた)</span>). He wanted a nice place to lounge that's tropical, but not too bright. So he came up with a plan: use a giant catapult to send a tsunami into the sun!
* Now picture it all in slow motion. The catapult tosses the tsunami into the air, it smashes the sun, breaks off into a wing of nice, hot water, and finally splashes back to the earth into a beautiful, secluded lagoon.
