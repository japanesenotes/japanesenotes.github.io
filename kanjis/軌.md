## Mnemonics
 * There are <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> nine</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> car</span>s all driving in the same place. With so many cars driving in the same place, they create a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rut</span>.
* Imagine the cars spinning out in the rut. Spin spin spin. The rut gets bigger. Nine is too many cars.
* To get out of the rut you have to put in a second <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>) that turns on the thrusters. You put in the key and press the take off button.
* Imagine turning the thrusters key, then feeling the car lift off the ground. You'll finally get out of this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rut</span>!
