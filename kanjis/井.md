## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> well</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> well</span> kanji are the same.
* Make sure you remember that this is a well of water not a well, actually.
* There is a single <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> well</span> in each and every town thanks to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>). One of the first things he decreed when he came to power was that all people have the right to easy and central access to water.
* The Shougun also really likes watching people do physical labor, so forcing his citizens to haul water up from the well is a plus too. But hey, they aren't thirsty!
