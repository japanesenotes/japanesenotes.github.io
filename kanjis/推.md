## Mnemonics
 * If a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> is pointing its <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> at you, you can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> infer</span> that it wants revenge. This turkey knows you killed his brother for dinner last night, and now he’s going to make you pay. You infer that this turkey is going to take their fingers and wrap them around your neck.
* Imagine a turkey is pointing at you with its fingers. The gears in your brain begin to slowly turn. From looking at the turkey to its fingers and back to the turkey, you can infer that something bad is probably about to happen to you.
* You were able to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> infer</span> the turkey's plan, so now it's your turn. You look around and see the only way out... is to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> swi</span>ng (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すい](https://jisho.org/search/すい)</span>) to safety! How did I infer that, dear Watson? Why, isn't it obvious! There are vines here. Turkeys can't fly. So I shall swing my way to freedom!
* Picture yourself as Sherlock Holmes, you inferred your way to freedom, swinging away on a conveniently-placed vine.
