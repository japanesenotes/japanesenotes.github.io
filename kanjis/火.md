## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fire</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fire</span> kanji are the same as each other.
* If you know the radicals then this one is EZPZ.
* Whenever we need to remember <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>, we use the word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> car</span>.<br />For this kanji, when we think <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fire</span>, we ought to think of something on fire. What's on fire? It's obviously your very own <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> car</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>)! Oh Goddd NOOO!
* Oh no... Oh no!! If you don't have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> car</span>, imagine what it'd feel like if your car just exploded and burned down. If you do have a car, imagine your own car in this situation. It should be a terrible feeling, if you imagine it well enough. So, when you think <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fire</span>, remember the fear you had when your car was given to the flames. Now you have to walk everywhere, sad :(
