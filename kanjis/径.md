## Mnemonics
 * You <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> loiter</span> around a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tombstone</span> to measure its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> diameter</span>. You’re doing this to each tombstone, and if you loiter around long enough, you’ll soon know the diameter of every tombstone.
* Imagine loitering around a tombstone. You're leaning on it. You're staring at nothing. Oh, and you're also measuring its diameter.
* You need to know the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> diameter</span> of each tombstone so you can make <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>kes (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けい](https://jisho.org/search/けい)</span>) for each one. But the cakes can't be wider than the tombstones, or they'll flop off onto the ground.
* These carefully measured tombstone-diameter cakes are your special way of saying thanks to the ghosts for letting you loiter around their graves.
