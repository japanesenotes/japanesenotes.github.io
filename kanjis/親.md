## Mnemonics
 * If you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> see</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> that you want to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stand</span> under to take a break while hiking, a good <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> parent</span> will stand under the tree with you. This is a kind and caring parent who can see that you are tired and want to relax by standing in the shade of this tree.
* Imagine that you’re on a long mountain hike and so far you’ve been hiking all in the sun with no shade. Feel the sun beating down on your back, the sweat getting in your eyes. Finally you see a tree to seek refuge under. It’s like an oasis in a desert. You’re saved!
* Once you get closer to the tree, you and your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> parent</span> see that it has some pretty crazy roots coming out of it. While making your way into the shade, you manage to bang your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shin</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しん](https://jisho.org/search/しん)</span>) on one of these roots. Your shins already hurt from walking so much, and this is just icing on the cake.
* Busting your shins on things really hurts. I'm sure you've hit your shins on coffee tables and the like all your life. Remember that pain and think how much worse it would be banging your bare shins on pointy tree roots after you've been hiking all day in the hot sun. Not enjoyable.
