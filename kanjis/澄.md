## Mnemonics
 * When the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> struck, it hit your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tent</span> full of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> beans</span>. When you lost your tent of beans, you had a moment of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lucidity</span>. You don't need so much stuff, you can live without it!
* Then you went back to being crazy. That moment of lucidity was only temporary, and you go back to stockpiling beans.
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lucidity</span> was caused by none other than Mrs. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chou</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょう](https://jisho.org/search/ちょう)</span>), though. After the tsunami wiped away your beans tent, you went crazy. Then, she came and slapped you in the face for being loud, making you lucid (for a bit).
* It's strange that Mrs. Chou would be the source of lucidity, but that's what she did just there. Of course, it was probably for selfish reasons, knowing her.
