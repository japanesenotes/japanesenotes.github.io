## Mnemonics
 * There is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cage</span> with an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> axe</span> in it above your house to show that you are an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> artisan</span>. All of the artisans have to have this special sign somewhere near where they live to show they make things.
* Imagine looking down your street and seeing caged axes above all of the artisans homes and shops. You want a new chair? You want some pants mended? Go to one of those signs and you'll find the right artisan.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Artisan</span>s have to be marked this way because the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>) says so. The Shougun doesn't want to have to put any effort into finding people to make things for him, so he created this new system.
* Picture the Shougun marching angrily down the street. His shoe suddenly snaps in half. With just one glance he'll be able to find the shoe artisan and make them fix his shoe for free.
