## Mnemonics
 * MOVING is HEAVY WORK.<br><br>When something is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heavy</span>, you need a lot of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> power</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> move</span> it. It’s not going to move unless you use a lot of power. That thing is heavy and unless you use all the power you got, it’s not moving.
* Picture a massive 1 ton weight. It’s heavy. You can’t even begin to move it without some sort of powerful machine to help you. Imagine yourself trying to move it with just your bare hands.
* Remember that 1 ton weight? Well, actually it’s a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dou</span>ghnut (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [どう](https://jisho.org/search/どう)</span>). A huge, massive, 1 ton doughnut. It’s super heavy and hard to move, but it’s delicious.
* Okay, so you don’t have enough power to move this doughnut as is. In order to move it, you’re going to have to use your superhuman power of eating. Once you eat enough of it, the remainder will be easy to move. Imagine yourself digging into this massive doughnut and taste its fresh baked goodness on your tongue. It’s mighty tasty.
