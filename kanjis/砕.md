## Mnemonics
 * Take this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stone</span> and throw it at <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> nine</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span>es to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> smash</span> them! It's like old-fashioned bowling, but instead of rolling this stone to knock down the crosses, you want to completely smash them to bits!
* Picture the nine crosses in front of you, lined up in a triangle. Now take your rock, hold it above your head, and SMASH it down on them as hard as you can!!
* As you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> smash</span> these crosses, you think of your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cy</span>borg (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さい](https://jisho.org/search/さい)</span>) and how much you want to smash the people who took it away from you. Your cyborg was so good at smashing things too. You could be smashing together, if you didn't have to sell it.
* You smash things because your own heart has been smashed by your cyborg. :'(
