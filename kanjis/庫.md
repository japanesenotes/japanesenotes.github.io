## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> canopy</span> is over your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> car</span> because your car is in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> storage</span> in a large <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> warehouse</span>.
* The canopy just protects your car from the elements as it sits in storage for long periods of time.
* Your car is in this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> storage</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> warehouse</span>, just sitting there. A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 子</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span>) notices this, and decides to take your car on a joyride. You won't notice, right? You never drive it.
* Imagine a kid sneaking into your canopy to steal your car that's in storage. Maybe it's two <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span>s, one stacked on the other with a trench coat. One <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span> works the pedals while the other <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span> works the steering.
