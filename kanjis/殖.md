## Mnemonics
 * When you go to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> yakuza</span> to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fix</span> your problems they'll just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> multiply</span>.
* You thought you had problems before? Yikes, now you've done it. The yakuza are just going to make all of your problems multiply!
* Just like I said, your problems <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> multiply</span> before your eyes and give you quite a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょく](https://jisho.org/search/しょく)</span>). You really shouldn't be shocked though, because I warned you this would happen.
* Feel shock envelop your entire body as late payments multiply into more debt, and the number of people mad at you multiply too. You can't even think from the shock of it all.
