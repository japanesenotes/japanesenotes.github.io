## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Grain</span>s get <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> blame</span>d for how much they <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accumulate</span>. If the grains accumulate too much then they make more work for the farmers. If they accumulate too little, then they're starving the people. Ugh, grains just can't win with you people. They're blamed for everything.
* Picture a pile of grains accumulating in size while a person watches. No matter how large the pile gets, the person keeps blaming them for something!
* Now the grains have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accumulate</span>d a ton, they're overflowing in their grain sacks, and the farmer freezes and says, Now those are some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sexy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せき](https://jisho.org/search/せき)</span>) grains.
* Is that why people become farmers? Because they think... accumulating a lot of grains is sexy? People are weird.
