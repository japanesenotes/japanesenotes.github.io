## Mnemonics
 * After a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span>, use this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> machine</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cure</span> the people and the country from the damage. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Heal</span>ing machines are all over Japan just in case a tsunami does way more damage than they can handle. <br />Oh, and whoever cures and heals the most people will be able to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rule</span> over them once everything starts going back to normal. So keep that in mind, kay?
* Imagine if you had your own machine to cure yourself if a tsunami came to where you live. It would be pretty convenient!
* Alternative ways to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cure</span> yourself after a tsunami are either praying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Je</span>sus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span>) or eating your weight in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chee</span>se (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ち](https://jisho.org/search/ち)</span>). I'm not sure if I have enough cheese for all the people that got hit though... Hmm, do you have cheese?<br />Before you make your decision, remember that whoever cures you will be able to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reign</span> over you and your people. So do you want to be led by Jesus or by some cheese? The choice is yours.
* Imagine getting Jesus to cure half the people and feeding the other half lots of cheese and their wounds miraculously healing on their own! You're a hero!
