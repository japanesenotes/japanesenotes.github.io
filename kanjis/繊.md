## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span>es <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> across special <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spikes</span> to separate the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fiber</span>s. The best way to separate the fibers of thread is to get a drunkard to do it. If you're too precise it will just snap. You gotta be loose with it! Just flop them onto the spikes and the fibers will come apart by themselves!
* Imagine a drunkard crossing threads onto spikes and pulling the tiny fibers free. You don't think you could do that. Maybe if you got drunk too...
* You stare at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fiber</span>s easily coming apart when you realize that this drunkard seems to have a few extra legs... and hair and a tail? This isn't just a drunk guy, it's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cen</span>taur (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span>). Maybe separating fibers is really a centaur trick, and that's why normal people can't do it...
* Watch the centaur cross the fibers and separate them with his spikes. How strange.
