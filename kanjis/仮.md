## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> is very <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> anti</span>-everything, making it all <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> temporary</span>. You get a new shirt, I'm anti shirts! he yells, and out it goes.
* He tires of things so quickly, you hardly have time to get used to them before they're gone.
* The leader's most <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> temporary</span> possession is his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>). Or... cars, because they're all very temporary. He buys one, drives it around, and then suddenly he's anti red car. He needs a blue one!
* Picture all of the temporary cars he's tried filling up an entire junkyard. They're all a little different, but in the end they were all just temporary fads.
