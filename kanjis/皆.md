## Mnemonics
 * When you COMPARE WHITE people, you realize that EVERYONE and no one is white...<br><br>If you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> compare</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> white</span> light to the other colors you'll realize... white consists of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> all</span> the colors in one. It contains all the colors in the spectrum in one color. It is the one color that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> everything</span>.
* Just look at the color white. Compare it to other colors. Now look at white again. Split it up into all the colors, creating a beautiful spectrum. Wow, it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> all</span> the colors!
* You decide white light is the ultimate color. You decide you want to put it on <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> all</span> things to make everything white. What a great idea, you think. You try to put it on everything and you nearly succeed... except, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> miners</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みな](https://jisho.org/search/みな)</span>). They keep getting dirty doing all their mining things. NOOO, your plan is ruined!
* Imagine everything covered in white. Everything in the world. Then, you see a dark splotch. It's the miners, they're all covered in coal, ruining all your ambitions. Walk up to them and see all the dirt on the perfectly white uniforms you gave them just a few minutes earlier. Feel enraged at them. How could they ruin all this white you made for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> all</span> the people of the world!?
