## Mnemonics
 * If you travel to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fish</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> capital</span>, you'll find the leader of all fish, the mighty <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> whale</span>! Okay, so a whale isn't technically a fish, but that's why it makes such a good leader. You can usually only find whales hanging around near the capital because they really enjoy ruling over all the other fish. They are the biggest, after all.
* Picture the underwater fish capital. Statues of whales line the fishy streets, and all of the fish bow down to the whale ruler's giant body.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> whale</span> who resides over the capital just happens to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gay</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [げい](https://jisho.org/search/げい)</span>). You only know this because his husband is a man whale too. Actually, now that you think about it, all the whales you've ever met have been gay.
* Picture the gay whale ruler holding whale hands... fins? with his whale husband. They're so cute.
