## Mnemonics
 * The radical <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> neck</span> and the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neck</span> are exactly the same!
* 
* The only thing you do with your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neck</span> is use it to swallow lots of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coo</span>l <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bea</span>ns (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くび](https://jisho.org/search/くび)</span>). Mm mm. Feel those cool, cool beans sliding down your neck. You don't really taste them, but you know they're there.
* Look at yourself in a mirror as the cool beans make their way down your neck. You can see them, like little ants marching all the way down to your tummy.
