## Mnemonics
 * You use a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bookshelf</span> as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> book counter</span>. Duh. What are you gonna count them one by one? Okay, well maybe, but you should count them while they're nice and organized and on shelves. Otherwise counting is going to be a huge pain.
* Imagine counting books on a bunch of bookshelves. One book, two book, red book, blue book!
* While you were counting books using this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> book counter</span> method, you got a bit tired and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sat</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さつ](https://jisho.org/search/さつ)</span>) down. But lucky for you, your books counter is a bookshelf, so just because you sat down doesn't mean you have to stop counting books.
* You sat down, but the books can't stop you from counting them.
