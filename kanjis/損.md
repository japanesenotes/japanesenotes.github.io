## Mnemonics
 * Raise your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> to another <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> member</span> and you'll receive a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> loss</span> in return. You should never hurt a member of your team, group, or society. It's just wrong. And you'll incur a loss as punishment for your bad deeds.
* Imagine raising your fingers to slap, hurt, or point angrily at a member of your own team. How dare you! I hope you're ready for some deep, personal loss.
* Unfortunately for you, payment is in the form of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> loss</span> of your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> son</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そん](https://jisho.org/search/そん)</span>). The loss of any family member is horrible, but this was your son. He was your favorite child. You loved him. But that's the loss you must bear for raising your fingers to a team member.
* Picture your son. Your future son, maybe even your animal son, if you don't want to have real kids. Now imagine the loss of that son. Nooooo!
