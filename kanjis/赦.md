## Mnemonics
 * If you spill something <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> red</span> on yourself in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> you should <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pardon</span> yourself immediately and try to find something else to wear. It's very dangerous to wear red in winter, and even if it seems rude, make sure you pardon yourself right away and get that taken care of!
* Imagine spilling red wine or red paint down your shirt. Quickly pardon yourself and get changed now!
* If you don't <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pardon</span> yourself fast enough the winter <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sha</span>man (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゃ](https://jisho.org/search/しゃ)</span>) will burst in and cast a spell on you, taking away all the clothes that have red on them! Now you have to pardon yourself for being naked!
* Imagine not pardoning yourself fast enough and having the winter shaman spirit away whatever you got red on. That's embarrassing.
