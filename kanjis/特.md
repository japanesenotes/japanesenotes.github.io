## Mnemonics
 * This <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cow</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> temple</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> special</span>. This cow must have been very important to have an entire temple dedicated to it.
* Picture a temple dedicated to a single cow. All of the people who come and worship here have a special place in their hearts for the cow.
* This cow is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> special</span> because it belonged to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Toku</span>gawa (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とく](https://jisho.org/search/とく)</span>) Ieyasu, Japan's first shougun and uniter of Japan! He's a super important figure in Japanese history. You should absolutely look him up and read a bit about him (when you're caught up on these lessons, that is).
* You walk up to a statue of the special cow in the temple and see a collar around its neck with that says Tokugawa Moo Moo on it. How... special!
