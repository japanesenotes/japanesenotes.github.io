## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> rolls in and destroys all the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> construction</span> that was being done on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inlet</span> and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bay</span>. Both the inlet and the bay were having a lot of construction done on them to repair the damage from the last tsunami, and then another tsunami rolled in and destroyed all that too. Bummer.
* Picture all the construction on the bay and the inlet getting destroyed by the tsunami. Look at all of it fall apart and crash to the ground as the tsunami knocks it down. Imagine yourself right near the action, feeling the water spray from the tsunami.
* Imagine the Japanese people standing on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bay</span> and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inlet</span> as the tsunami approaches. “<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Eh</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [え](https://jisho.org/search/え)</span>)? What is that, Akiko?” “Eh? Where? Oh gawd, it’s a tsunami!!”
* EH? A tsunami you say? Those construction areas are screwed, man. Again, imagine the tsunami demolishing the area. Then be all like, “Eh? A tsunami? Aw, man.”
