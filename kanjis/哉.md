## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span> has <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> in his <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> as he tries to talk to you. You walk over and he spits a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> question mark</span> into your hand. It's covered in dirt and spit. Um... does this mean he's confused? He probably doesn't even know where he is. But how did he make this question mark and why was it in his mouth?
* Imagine having a drunkard spit a dirty question mark into your hand. You want to say, Yes, I'm ??? too.
* The drunkard takes the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> question mark</span> back and presses it to his head. He's wearing a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ya</span>nkee's (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [や](https://jisho.org/search/や)</span>) cap. Oh come on. Do you just want to know the Yankee's score in the game? The drunkard nods.
* Picture yourself throwing the question mark at the drunkard who only cares about the Yankees. What a waste of time.
