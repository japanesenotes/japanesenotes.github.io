## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> criminal</span> that stole your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> car</span> was your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> comrade</span>! You thought the two of you were friends, but you were probably wrong.
* Just because someone is your comrade doesn't mean they actually like you. Don't let your guard down and let them near your car.
* You feel really weird about this whole situation so you write your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> comrade</span> a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hai</span>ku (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はい](https://jisho.org/search/はい)</span>). It's really all you can do, since your car is long gone.
* Comrade, what the heck<br />I want to get my car back<br />I thought we were friends.
