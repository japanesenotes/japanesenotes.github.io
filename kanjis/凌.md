## Mnemonics
 * If you touch <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ice</span> for too long you'll get <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> frostbite</span> and that's a really hard thing to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> endure</span>. A lot of people can't, and die. Then again, you managed to endure touching ice long enough to get frostbite in the first place, so maybe this is baby stuff for you.
* Imagine having to endure the pain of frostbite because you were a jerk who put his hand on ice for a few hours.
* The best people in the world at being able to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> endure</span> the pain are the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shino</span>bi (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しの](https://jisho.org/search/しの)</span>) ninjas! They train by hanging out in frozen areas all the time and don't complain at all. Maybe if the pain gets to be too much you can go ask them for advice.
* Imagine if you were one of these cool Shinobi ninjas that could endure the extreme cold and pain of frostbite!
