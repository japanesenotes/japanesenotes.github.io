## Mnemonics
 * In the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> morning</span>, if you want your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hat</span> to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dry</span>, you need to hang it on a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tree trunk</span>. In the morning, everything is covered in dew. The grass is wet, the leaves are wet, but the tree trunk isn't wet! It was protected by the rest of the tree, so you can hang your hat there to dry.
* Picture everything early in the morning covered in damp dew. Even your hat is uncomfortably wet. Now walk up to a large tree trunk and touch it—it's dry!
* You lean against the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tree trunk</span>, waiting for your hat to dry, and suddenly you realize Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>) is on the other side of it. You look around and see that all of the tree trunks around you have Mongols drying their hats under them.
* Now that you think about it, Genghis Khan was the one who taught people that tree trunks stay dry in the morning!
