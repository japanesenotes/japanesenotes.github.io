## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cow</span> part of this kanji is slightly altered, but I think you can see where it is. The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gun</span> looks just fine, though. Think back to a fake memory you have living on the farm. You have your gun, and you gotta use it on a cow (ruh roh). Once a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> year</span> on New Year's, you have to go out and shoot one of the cows. It's only a yearly shooting, though, so at least there's that respite.
* You'll have to imagine yourself doing this to remember the meaning of the kanji. Focus on the thought that okay... it's only once a year... I only have to do this once a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> year</span>...
* It is New <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Years</span>, though, so when you bring the dead cow back home, it’s time to celebrate. Using the cow’s organs and bones, you and your siblings construct a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nen</span>doroid (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ねん](https://jisho.org/search/ねん)</span>). Nendoroids are Japanese toys - little plastic figurines (Google it if need be). You make a little cow nendoroid holding a gun. How cute.
* How funny that you use dead cow parts to make a miniature cow holding a gun much like the one you murdered earlier. Imagine yourself playing with this nendoroid as you think about how weird it was to make a cow nendoroid out of a dead cow.
