## Mnemonics
 * You take all of your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> allocate</span> them into one place to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> unite</span> them. You wrap all the thread together into a giant thread ball. Now it's a big, united mess!
* Allocate all of your thread like you would your cash: by uniting it! Not at a bank, but in a big, intertwined lump.
* You're busy trying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> unite</span> all of your thread, twisting and tying and wrapping, and suddenly you look at the ball in your hands and see <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> とうきょう</span>. You've united this thread into the shape of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span>. There are even little pins for all the famous neighborhoods and tourist spots. This is strange, because you don't remember putting them there.
* Try to do this yourself at home. Unite all of your thread and poof! There's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span>!
