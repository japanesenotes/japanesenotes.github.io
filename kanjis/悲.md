## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> criminal</span>'s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span> will always be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sad</span>. No one chooses a life of crime if they're happy. And even if they seem like they're doing fine on the outside, deep down they're really sad.
* Imagine watching a criminal after he's done stealing from a bank. He's all alone. He stops throwing the money around. And cries. So so sad.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sad</span> feelings fill the criminal's body with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> he</span>at (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひ](https://jisho.org/search/ひ)</span>). This heat spreads and radiates out. If you walk next to them on the street, you'll feel the sad heat floating by you.
* Imagine being so sad that your entire body fills with heat. That heat even makes squiggly heat lines pop out above and around you.
