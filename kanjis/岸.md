## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mountain</span> on top of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cliff</span> is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dry</span> from the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coast</span> below. Just from looking at the raging <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shore</span> below, you'd think everything would be wet, it's splashing everywhere!
* You're on top of the mountain and the entire coast is stretching out below. The shore goes as far as your eyes can see.
* Sitting up there, watching the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coast</span> with you, is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Gan</span>dhi (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がん](https://jisho.org/search/がん)</span>). The world famous Gandhi, is just hanging out up here with you, looking down at what you now realize must be a coast in India.
* Sit down next to Gandhi and close your eyes. You can hear the water hitting the shore below. The coastal birds are screaming. You crack open an eye and see Gandhi still sitting perfectly still.
