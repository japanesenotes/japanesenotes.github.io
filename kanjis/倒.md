## Mnemonics
 * On January 6, the leader with the mole (fur) clothing was the leader with (did he have a knife?). Anyway, he tried to OVERTHROW the government<br><br>Someone stabbed the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mole</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> overthrow</span> it. Now there is a new mole leader. Because that's what happens when you overthrow someone—someone else needs to take over. In this case, a vengeful mole.
* Imagine a mole sneaking up behind the leader mole and stabbing him with a knife. This type of overthrowing of leadership feels familiar to you. Maybe this has happened before in the past?
* Where do leaders get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> overthrow</span>n the most? In <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> とうきょう</span>. Just think back in Japanese history, back when everyone was at war with one another. People were taking over and getting overthrown and then that guy gets overthrown and then THAT guy gets overthrown. Basically, it used to be hard to stay a leader in <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span>.
* Picture this like an exaggerated reenactment on the History channel. Leader after leader of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span> gets overthrown and replaced with the next guy. It never stops. (Until the end of the Edo period, I guess.)
