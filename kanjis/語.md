## Mnemonics
 * What you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> between <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> five</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span>s is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> language</span>. As long as there are five different people saying these same words with their five mouths, it's considered its own language.
* Picture these five mouths saying the same language to each other. They can understand each other! The mouths are smiling and laughing too.
* Another mouth joins in speaking the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> language</span>, but it's green and scaled and... it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Go</span>dzilla's (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ご](https://jisho.org/search/ご)</span>) mouth! Godzilla speaks this language too.
* Godzilla speaks a language some people understand! You wish you knew this earlier, then you might have been able to stop some of his destruction. Try to say, Hey Godzilla, please stop destroying my city, in his language. It's a lot of growling and yelling. He doesn't seem to understand you. You better practice your pronunciation.
