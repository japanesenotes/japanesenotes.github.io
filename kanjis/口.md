## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mouth</span> kanji are exactly the same!
* If you learned your radicals–which the WaniKani system forces you to do (unless you're cheating)–you'll already know the meaning of the kanji.
* You can't get that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mouth</span> out of your mind. Remember seeing the construction worker <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> earlier in the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [工](https://jisho.org/search/工)</span> mnemonic? You can't forget construction worker <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>'s mouth.
* You just can't forget all the cool things about kanji learning he said from that mouth. What a cool mouth <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> has. How are the lips of his mouth both so skinny and fat at the same time?
