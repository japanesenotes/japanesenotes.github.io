## Mnemonics
 * From the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> of your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> older brother</span> comes... a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> curse</span>!
* Imagine him cursing you. He's not a fan of you, since you are siblings, but to think he'd go so far as to put a curse on you? You can't believe it. What kind of curse did he put upon you?
* Turns out, he put the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> no ro</span>ad (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [のろ](https://jisho.org/search/のろ)</span>) curse on you, meaning you can never walk on roads.
* In your mind, walk around the area where you live. Think about the places you can go that aren't roads. If you try to walk on a road, you can't. This is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> no ro</span>ad curse, after all.
