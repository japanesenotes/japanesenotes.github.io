## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> has a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> book</span> all about the human <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> body</span>. Knowing about bodies is a privilege. One that only leaders get—it helps them control all their subjects, like you.
* Imagine looking down at your body and thinking, huh, I wonder what all that junk is? Oh well, I'm sure the leader has it all figured out in that book of his.
* The leader's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> body</span> book also taught him about something very body specific: how to tie a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tie</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たい](https://jisho.org/search/たい)</span>). You can't have a tie on your body, no no. Those are for the leader and his smart body.
* Picture the leader, reading a book, putting a tie on his body. Look around at you and your family and your neighbors. You don't know what your body meat-bags do and you don't know how to tie a tie. Womp womp.
