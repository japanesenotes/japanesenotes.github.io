## Mnemonics
 * You stick <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> using them as <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spikes</span> and you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> line up</span> the horns in a straight line. Horns are pretty much the same thing as spikes once you stick them in the ground, and you line these ones up precisely for optimal protection.
* Imagine yourself lining up these horns in the ground. The spikes are sharp and you poke yourself with one. Ouch. Need to be more careful as you line these up.
* As you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> line up</span> these horns and stick them into the ground, you notice a bull munching on <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hay</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [へい](https://jisho.org/search/へい)</span>) nearby. It's staring at the horns you're lining up. Somehow it feels like it's munching that hay angrily. You gulp, looking at its horn as it grabs another mouthful of hay, and you feel pretty guilty.
* Imagine the hay in that bull's mouth as it chomps angrily, watching you line up horns in the ground. It probably wishes you were the hay.
