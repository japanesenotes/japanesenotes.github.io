## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> radical and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thread</span> are the same in looks as well as in meaning.
* This is why it's good to make sure you know your radicals.
* You have some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thread</span>... what's the first thing you do with it? You take it and put it in your mouth, and start sucking it down like spaghetti. You have decided to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eat</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いと](https://jisho.org/search/いと)</span>) the thread.
* Think about how it tastes. Think about how it feels in your throat. Let it get caught on your teeth and around your tongue. It's a weird feeling having thread in your mouth, and you want to use that weird feeling to remember you're going to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eat</span> it.
