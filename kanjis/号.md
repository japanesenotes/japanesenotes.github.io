## Mnemonics
 * There's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> (in our case, it's a hatch), and inside is some kind of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> prison</span> you can't quite get to. If you've ever seen Lost, this will sound familiar... on the hatch, there's actually a series of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> number</span>s that you don't understand.
* What are these numbers? What do they mean? Think over it for a while, get frustrated, and try to figure it out. You can't, though, so you probably won't ever get inside.
* You want to know the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> number</span> to the hatch? yells an old voice from inside. You say yes, and the voice gives you the numbers and you're in! You go down into the prison, where there is one prisoner: Grandpa Koichi (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ごういち</span>).<br />Note: For <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ごう](https://jisho.org/search/ごう)</span> reading mnemonics, we use <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ごう](https://jisho.org/search/ごう)いち</span> (grandpa Koichi) because <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち]([こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち)</span> is used for the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)</span> reading. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)</span> becomes <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ごう](https://jisho.org/search/ごう)</span> becomes grandpa <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ごう](https://jisho.org/search/ごう)いち</span>.
* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ごう](https://jisho.org/search/ごう)いち</span> keeps saying numbers as you free him from the prison. Just one after another. Numbers numbers numbers. Hopefully old man <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ごう](https://jisho.org/search/ごう)いち</span> isn't crazy.
