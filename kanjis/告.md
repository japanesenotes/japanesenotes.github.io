## Mnemonics
 * Mouth + something = Announce (which u do with your mouth...)<br><br>Saying you're going to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span> the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> out of your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> is just another way of saying you're going to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> announce</span> something. All that information is the dirt, and to announce that dirt you just slide it on out of your mouth. How's that for a visual?
* The next time you have something important to announce, calm your nerves by imagining dirt sliding out of your mouth. It's that easy!
* Now that you're about to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> announce</span> something important, you should maybe get it nice and smooth in your mouth so the dirt can slide out easier. So take a big gulp of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Coke</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こく](https://jisho.org/search/こく)</span>). Coke is just like, the dirt of soda anyway, you know?
* Imagine drinking some coke and then making an announcement. Try not to burp while you talk.
