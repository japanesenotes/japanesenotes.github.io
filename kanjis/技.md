## Mnemonics
 * You can <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> branch</span> out your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span>. It's your special <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> skill</span>. Your fingers branch out into smaller fingers and you can hold things really well. You can type super-duper fast. And you can win any tickle fight. These are skills you have thanks to your branching fingers.
* If you could have any skill imaginable, what would it be? Would it be to have these magical branching fingers? (Definitely. It would.)
* Unfortunately, these <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> skill</span>s are too much for the normal skill-less people to handle and they pull out the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gui</span>llotine (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎ](https://jisho.org/search/ぎ)</span>). I guess they're going to chop off your skillful fingers because they're kinda scary.
* Imagine a tiny guillotine made for the cutting of fingers. Whoever made this must have had special hand skills too! Maybe they tested it on him...
