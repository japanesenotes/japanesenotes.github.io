## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bamboo</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bamboo</span> kanji are exactly the same!
* Just make sure you know your radicals!
* There's a little <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bamboo</span> shrub sitting there, holding onto a lollipop. Because you're bigger than the bamboo shrub, you just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> take</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たけ](https://jisho.org/search/たけ)</span>) it from the bamboo, causing it to cry.
* Of course, focus on the absurdity of a bamboo shrub that can cry and eat a lollipop. Also, think about how mean you are to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> take</span> the lollipop away from a defenseless bamboo shrub in the first place!
