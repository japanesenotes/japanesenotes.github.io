## Mnemonics
 * I'll cut that baby in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> half</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span> if you don't figure out custody, says the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> judge</span>. Ah, the oldest judge trick in the book.
* Since you two can't make a decision on who gets custody of the baby, the judge now has to step in and judge for you. Will you figure it out for yourself, or let the baby get cut in half? What an effective judge.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> judge</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Han</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はん](https://jisho.org/search/はん)</span>) Solo, so you know he's not going to back down.
* Han Solo the judge isn't a bad person... but he isn't so good either. He'll cut that baby in half if you don't figure things out. That's the kind of judge Han Solo is.
