## Mnemonics
 * This <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> has <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> two</span> things that remind him of his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> humanity</span>: his shoes, and his hat. These two things remind the leader of his humanity because humans are the only ones who wear shoes and hats.
* Reflect upon your own humanity. What does it mean to be human? Is it wearing shoes and hats? Probably.
* Another thing that reminds you and the leader about your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> humanity</span> is wearing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> jean</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じん](https://jisho.org/search/じん)</span>). Jeans are the go-to legwear for many people, and no one but humans wear them. Jeans are another great symbol of humanity.
* Are you wearing jeans right now? If so, rub them with your hands and say aloud “Oh, the humanity!” Or just imagine wearing jeans if you aren’t actually wearing them.
