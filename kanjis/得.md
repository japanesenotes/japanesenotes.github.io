 * <div><div>To<strong>&nbsp;gain</strong>&nbsp;more knowledge of what's goin on in the world I'm reading&nbsp;<em>column</em>&nbsp;after&nbsp;<em>column</em>&nbsp;of articles in the newspapers, and it takes so much time I'm&nbsp;<em>glued</em>&nbsp;to it till&nbsp;<em>nightbreak</em>.</div></div><div><div><i></i></div></div><br><br>If you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> loiter</span> around the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> temple</span>, it's likely you'll <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> acquire</span> something. When you loiter around like that it looks like you're waiting for something, so if someone puts something in your hands and you just happen to acquire it, well, no one can fault you for that.<br>
* Imagine loitering around near the sun temple. Maybe you acquire some illegal goods, maybe you just acquire a tan (it is a SUN temple, after all). 
* You managed to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> acquire</span> some tobacco, but just as you're about to leave <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Toku</span>gawa (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とく](https://jisho.org/search/とく)</span>) Ieyasu comes marching up to you!! Or at least, his ghost does. He stares you dead in the eyes and says, I didn't found the shogunate for you to acquire illegal goods and kill your body toking on my soil.
* Your eyes fill with tears under Tokugawa's gaze and you drop everything you acquired to the ground. You bow before him apologizing. You'll never do this again!
