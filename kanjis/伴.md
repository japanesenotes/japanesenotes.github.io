## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> asks <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> half</span> of his men to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accompany</span> him on a secret mission. The leader’s mission is volunteer only, so it’s impressive that he got half of his men to accompany him.
* Imagine you are one of the leader’s men who volunteered. What made you want to accompany him? Imagine the good qualities of this leader and how he inspired you to accompany him on this mission.
* The leader you decided to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accompany</span> is none other than <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Han</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はん](https://jisho.org/search/はん)</span>) Solo. Who could be more inspiring? I’m surprised not more than half decided to accompany him. Han Solo is awesome.
* Imagine yourself as you accompany Han Solo. You try to stay calm, but you’re just so excited to be around Han Solo.
