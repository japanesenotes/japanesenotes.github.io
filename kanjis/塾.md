## Mnemonics
 * There's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sock</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> circle</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> on your way to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cram school</span>. Every day after school you walk straight until you get to the sock circle, you run around it, and then head off in any direction. Somehow it always leads to cram school.
* Picture the sock circle in the dirt in your mind. Now look up and see cram school through the trees.
* The sock circle seems to have a bit of a gravitational pull, so to make sure you get to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cram school</span> on time you have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> juke</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゅく](https://jisho.org/search/じゅく)</span>) around it every day, to make sure you can get past it.
* Normal kids would probably try to juke cram school, since it's hard and it's more school than they think they need. But you're a good kid who want to cram, so you juke the circle instead.
