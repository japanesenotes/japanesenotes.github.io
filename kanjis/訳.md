## Mnemonics
 * They <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shrimp</span> who is bad with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> translation</span> has no <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reason</span> to live. Most shrimp make a living with their translation skills. They are the translators of the ocean. If they don’t know how to say something in all the languages of the sea, they have no reason to live. They might as well be dead.
* Imagine this one shrimp who is bad at translation. He’s trying to find a reason to live, but he’s having trouble. Look at him all alone, being shunned by the other shrimp.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> translation</span> this shrimp failed to make was for the word “<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yak</span>” (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [やく](https://jisho.org/search/やく)</span>). The shrimp found no <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reason</span> to translate yak because there are no yak in the sea and then the shrimp just started questioning everything in his life and fell apart.
* The translation of the word yak was the reason this shrimp fell into despair and gave up the translation profession. Now everyone hates him. See this poor shrimp being harassed by others while they shout at him, “Yak! Yak! Yak!”
