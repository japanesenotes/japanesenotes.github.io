## Mnemonics
 * If you find some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice</span> in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> top hat</span> it's going to be really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coarse</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rough</span>. Probably because it's not the kind that's meant to be eaten.
* Imagine trying to eat the rice you found in a top hat. It's so coarse it feels like it's scratching your teeth. There's probably some dirt in here too. This wasn't the best idea.
* You take the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coarse</span> rice and try to wash it with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> so</span>ap (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そ](https://jisho.org/search/そ)</span>).
* If you were trying to make this coarse rice taste like soap, you did it. But if you were trying to make it less coarse, well... sorry, but that's not how anything works.
