## Mnemonics
 * You have to use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> to make an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> exit</span> because you're so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clumsy</span>. You can't seem to get the door to open, your hands just slip around on the nob uselessly. Instead, you take your fingers and stick them into the door frame, pulling the whole thing off the hinges so you can leave.
* Of course, you're too clumsy to do that right either, you accidentally threw the door backwards and hurt some people...
* After you make your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clumsy</span> mistake you realize that these doors come in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sets</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せつ](https://jisho.org/search/せつ)</span>). And now you have to try to open another door. And another door. So many sets of doors!
* Imagine trying to use your clumsy fingers all over the sets of doors. You keep falling over and hurting yourself. Why is it so hard to leave?!
