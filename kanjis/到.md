## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mole</span> has a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span> ready for your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> arrival</span>. You get out of your airplane, you step on the ground and... ouch! You stepped right on the knife, and there's the mole, sticking it out of the ground. I checked the schedule for your arrival! it squeaks happily, and disappears.
* Welp, your arrival didn't go smoothly. You have a knife in your foot. I'm not sure what you did to make that mole hate you, but you'll have to be more careful next time.
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> arrival</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> とうきょう</span> is now ruined. And your next stop is now going to be an arrival at a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span> hospital to get this mole knife out.
* This certainly wasn't the type of arrival you were expecting when you bought your tickets to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span>.
