## Mnemonics
 * This is a pictogram of&nbsp;<em>STRING theory</em>. LIFE is made of STRINGS.&nbsp;<em>STRINGs</em>&nbsp;are the most<strong>&nbsp;ELEMENTary</strong>&nbsp;particles of matter, which then&nbsp;<em>grow up</em>&nbsp;to become matter itself.<br><br>The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> life</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> is an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> element</span> essential to all living things. This thread of life joins all things together, providing an essential relationship between all life. This element is all that holds this world together.
* Visualize this element of life, interconnecting all living things. Without it, everything would fall apart and into chaos.
* You need to keep this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> element</span> clean, so you make sure to wash it with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> so</span>ap (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そ](https://jisho.org/search/そ)</span>) every single day. This turns out to be pretty hard because the element is an invisible thread, but you do your best.
* Imagine grabbing hold of the element that holds all life together and trying to wash it with soap. It's slippery so you keep dropping it and soap keeps going in your eyes.
