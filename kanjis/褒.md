## Mnemonics
 * Lift the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lid</span> off your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> preserve</span>s, <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> kick</span> it, and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> praise</span> the lord! Your food is preserved, you don't need the lid anymore, praise be!
* You also praise the lid. And praise the plants and animals that gave you the food.
* You do this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prais</span>ing in your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ho</span>me (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほう](https://jisho.org/search/ほう)</span>), though, not a church. I don't think anyone outside your home would understand why you're praising inanimate objects.
* If you're going to praise the ingenuity of the invention of the lid for its preservation methods, you should definitely do it from home. Or at least from the internet from home. Find your people where you can, you know?
