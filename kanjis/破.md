## Mnemonics
 * If you scrape a sharp <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stone</span> against your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> skin</span>, it will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tear</span>. The sharp stone tears your skin. It hurts!
* Imagine this sharp stone. Feel its weight in your hand. Now drag the sharp stone against your skin. Feel your skin as it begins to tear. The pain is agonizing.
* The moment your skin <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tear</span>s you can't help but yelp <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ha</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span>)! It sounds like a laugh, but it's more like a pained bark.
* You make this noise when you tear other things with the sharp stone too, but now it's more of a HA! TAKE THAT! Feel the same pain I feel!
