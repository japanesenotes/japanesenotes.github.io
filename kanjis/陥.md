## Mnemonics
 * This <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span> was a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> former</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> prison</span> until the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cave in</span>. You see, prisons aren't built very carefully, they just try to get them done fast enough to stuff people in there. So while you can tell this was once a building, it definitely isn't a prison anymore, since the whole thing caved in.
* Picture the cave in in your mind. Can you see all the little prisoners and guards being squished as the building tumbles down around them? Oh no!
* You keep picturing the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cave in</span> and you see Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>) climbing over the rubble. He's the one who took down this prison! And he's coming for your town next!
* Genghis Khan is all about being smart and using better tactics. In this case, why fight a bunch of guards and prisoners when you can just cause a cave in and win immediately? The ol' Khan cave in, a classic war maneuver.
