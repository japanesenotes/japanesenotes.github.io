## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> servant</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> servant</span> kanji are exactly the same! Just remember that the kanji also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> retainer</span> and you’ll be fine.
* Retainer and servant are basically the same thing, so remembering this one shouldn’t be too hard for you.
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> servant</span>, also known as your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> retainer</span>, bangs his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shins</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しん](https://jisho.org/search/しん)</span>) all the time so you make him wear <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> jean</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じん](https://jisho.org/search/じん)</span>) to work now. He bangs his shins on all the furniture in the house, knocking over all your valuables. But at least when he’s wearing jeans it doesn’t leave bruises like it did when he wasn’t wearing pants.
* Imagine your servant banging his shins on everything in your house. Hand him a pair of jeans and tell him to put them on to soften the blows.
