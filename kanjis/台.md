## Mnemonics
 * You have a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> private</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> that's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> machine</span>. But you have to keep your machine mouth private because it would scare all the non-machine people around you.
* Doesn't this kanji look like a machine mouth? Now wouldn't you want to keep that private from the people you know?
* To make sure they can't tell what's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> machine</span> and what's human, you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dye</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だい](https://jisho.org/search/だい)</span>) the mouth to make it look like skin. You find dye the same shade as your normal mouth and just slap it on there.
* Imagine being so afraid that people will find out about your machine mouth that you have to dye it to match a normal human mouth. Oh, when will this discrimination against machine-kind end?!
