## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> storehouse</span> is another storehouse you own. Remember how your regular storehouse holds zombies (from the kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [蔵](https://jisho.org/search/蔵)</span>?). Your moon storehouse is on the moon, and it is filled with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> internal organs</span>.
* Your moon storehouse has internal organs because 1) you have to keep them far away from the zombies or they'll go berserk, and 2) you think it's funny to see them bounce around in low gravity. Boing, boing, boing, haha look at that internal organ.
* Where did you get all these <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> internal organ</span>s from? You actually harvested them from the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> zo</span>mbies (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぞう](https://jisho.org/search/ぞう)</span>) from your other storehouse. 
* Basically, you store zombies in your regular storehouse, harvest their organs, then launch them into space where they are put into a storehouse on the moon where the zombies will never be able to find them again.
