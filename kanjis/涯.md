## Mnemonics
 * There is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> coming up over a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cliff</span> made of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span>. You can see this happening very far away because it's right on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> horizon</span>.
* Picture the tsunami breaking over the cliff on the horizon. It would be beautiful if it wasn't so frightening.
* You squint into the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> horizon</span> and see something else. There's some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> guy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がい](https://jisho.org/search/がい)</span>) up there. And he's... he's being swept away by the tsunami. The guy disappears into the horizon. The guy is gone.
* You wonder who that guy was. You wonder why he was there. You wonder if he's still alive out there, past the horizon.
