## Mnemonics
 * In this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> construction</span> project, they will be using <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> to hold everything together. The color of the thread is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deep red</span>, and it gives everything a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crimson</span> look.
* Because thread isn't that strong, you have to use A LOT (to hold things like beams in place). So, the deep red / crimson thread actually stands out a lot in this construction project.
* You're done, and the whole building is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deep red</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crimson</span> color (it takes a lot of thread to hold a whole building in place). It's time to show the client, Emperor <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>, the finished product. 
* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち]([こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち)</span> walks up with a big smile on his face. I love the color crimson! he exclaims. It's the same deep red color as my enemies.<br />Hint: When you see <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [工](https://jisho.org/search/工)</span> in a kanji it will often take the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)</span> reading.
