## Mnemonics
 * There is an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> animal</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grass</span> and your horrible <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> task</span> is to go <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hunting</span> for it.
* Picture the shape of the animal in the grass, off in the distance. You can't see what kind of animal it is yet, but you know you're hunting it.
* You're currently <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hunting</span> in a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> row</span> (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> りょう</span>) boat and you have to row as quietly and carefully as you can or the animal will run away.
* You wouldn't be able to go hunting in any other kind of boat—the motor would be too loud. Picture yourself in a row boat with all of your hunting gear. You need to be extra careful not to make any loud splashing sounds with the oars!
