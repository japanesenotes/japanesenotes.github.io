## Mnemonics
 * Tie a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> squid</span> to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span> and you get a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sword</span>! Knives are too small to be considered a sword on their own. That's why you strapped a squid to it. They're the right shape, kinda pointed, so no one will know it's just a knife.
* Imagine creating your own sword out of a knife and a squid.
* You learned how to make <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sword</span>s this way from <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ken</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けん](https://jisho.org/search/けん)</span>) the samurai. He put his own little squid buddy on his knife and now no one realizes it's not a sword!
* Picture Ken swinging his squid sword at you. *Squish* it squirts ink on your shoulder. But it doesn't really hurt.
