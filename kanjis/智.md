## Mnemonics
 * You shoot an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> arrow</span> at the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> so that it will grant you a gift of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wisdom</span>. You heard about a Greek hero doing this and the god in the sun gave him the wisdom to see everything. You're hoping it will work for you too.
* Imagine shooting an arrow at the mouth of the sun and then waiting for the wisdom of the world to hit you. Did it work? Will you know when it works? Probably...
* You're standing around waiting for the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wisdom</span> to hit you when something else does. In the head. Ouch! You look down and it's a wheel of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chee</span>se (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ち](https://jisho.org/search/ち)</span>)! At first you're angry, until you realize that this must be a sign. Cheese IS wisdom. And they key to wisdom is eating a lot of cheese!
* Picture yourself thanking the sun for teaching you that all wisdom comes from cheese. Now take a big bite!
