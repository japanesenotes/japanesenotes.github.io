## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> old</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> (the moon we had before the current moon) was actually just a huge <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> barbarian</span> floating in the sky.
* Just imagine a huge barbarian (whatever that means to you) floating in the sky, looking down. Some ancient people look up and wave at the old moon barbarian.
* At least, this is the kind of story you told your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 子</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span>) when they asked you where the moon came from.
* You see, my child, the old moon was not like the current moon. It was a giant barbarian in the sky, who would eat children that asked too many questions.
