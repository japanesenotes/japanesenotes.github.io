## Mnemonics
 * In your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> you put a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sword</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span>. Now that you have them in there, you have to make them <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> separate</span> from each other.
* Anyone can put a sword and knife in their mouth. But not everyone can make them separate while still in your mouth.
* Why are you trying to make a sword and knife <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> separate</span> in your mouth? Because someone <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bets you</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [べつ](https://jisho.org/search/べつ)</span>) can't do it.
* I bet you can't separate the sword and knife, they say in an annoying voice. Alright, time for you to show them. Nobody bets you anything without you blindly trying to do it!
