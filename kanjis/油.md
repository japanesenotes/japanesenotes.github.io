## Mnemonics
 * This <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> reason</span> we have so much <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> oil</span> now. The tsunami moved a bunch of earth out of the way, so now it’s really easy to dig for oil. Thanks tsunami!
* Watch as this tsunami crashes over the land, pushing earth out of the way. Once the tsunami passes, hear the spewing geysers of oil as they erupt out of the ground.
* Now that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> oil</span> is so abundant, everyone lives in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yu</span>rts (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆ](https://jisho.org/search/ゆ)</span>). They're light and mobile, so people can just move from oil well to oil well, collecting oil.
* Look at how this oil has changed the world. Instead of living in big homes, condos, or skyscrapers, everyone lives in a yurt at night and travels with all the oil by day.
