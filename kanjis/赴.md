## Mnemonics
 * You need to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> run</span> on your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> toe</span>s if you want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> proceed</span> down this road. If you can't run on your toes, well then you're out of luck, and you won't be able to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> move on</span> at all. I didn't make this rule, I just enforce it. Now run!
* Imagine trying to proceed down the road by running on your toes. No other part of your foot can touch the ground!
* If you find that you can't <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> proceed</span>, you're a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foo</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>). Everyone can run on their toes. Don't you know that? No? Then you're an even bigger fool, now get outta here!
* Imagine being called a fool when you can't proceed along the road because running on your toes ends up being super hard to do.
