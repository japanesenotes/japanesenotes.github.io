## Mnemonics
 * In the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> capital</span>, a broken <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dog</span> begins to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> settle in</span>. This dog used to live in the country, but he kept getting caught in bear and fox traps which busted the poor dog up. The dog didn’t want to live like this, so he decided to settle in the capital city where there aren’t pesky animal traps to get caught in.
* Imagine this dog going to the capital and settling in. The poor dog looks pretty messed up though. The radical for dog in this kanji is a bit modified, so just remember that the dog in this story is all messed up.
* In order to help the dog <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> settle in</span>, the capital cobbler makes him a pair of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shoe</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅう](https://jisho.org/search/しゅう)</span>). The shoes help walk on his hurt legs, but more importantly, they help him relax and feel like a dog again.
* Watch the broken dog settle in to his new shoes in his new home in the capital. The old dog can finally enjoy life!
