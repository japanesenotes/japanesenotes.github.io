## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> narwhal</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> is all you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> have</span>. Imagine one of each under your arms.
* You don't have anything else. This is it. All you have. 
* Everything you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> have</span> (except the narwhal and the moon) were taken from you by a roving gang of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> you</span>ths (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆう](https://jisho.org/search/ゆう)</span>).
* They came and took your things. Now they have all your stuff, and you only have the moon and a narwhal. You don't have much anymore, but at least you have these things still.
