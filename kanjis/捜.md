## Mnemonics
 * You want to get your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> humble</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span>, so you dedicate your life to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> search</span> for it. Wait, the humble stool? You know, like the holy grail or the arc of the covenant, but it's called the humble stool. It's from some bible or something, I promise.
* Now you have to search through a bunch of religious texts for this humble stool with your fingers. Don't go too fast and get paper cuts!
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> search</span> and you search and, unfortunately, you spend your entire life searching and you die without finding the humble stool. But don't worry, your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>) comes back and now you get to continue your search but with afterlife powers!
* You dedicated your soul to searching, and now that your soul is free from its body, you can continue the search until you find it!
