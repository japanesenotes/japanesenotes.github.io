## Mnemonics
 * Hang a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> towel</span> in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> greenhouse</span> and it turns into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> curtain</span>. Greenhouses are made of windows, it's all glass, there are no walls. So when you put a towel in there it turns into a curtain. It has no choice but to cover a window, after all.
* Imagine hanging towels over all the windows in the greenhouse. They're really fuzzy, thick curtains now.
* You're hanging these towel <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> curtain</span>s because you need a quiet place to eat a Big <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Mac</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まく](https://jisho.org/search/まく)</span>). But you're a little ashamed. Big macs aren't really good for you, but this stupid greenhouse has too many windows and everyone can see you stuff your face. So that's where the towel curtains come in.
* Imagine hiding in a greenhouse blocked off with towel curtains, stuffing your face with big macs. No one can shame you in here. You can eat as many as you want. And hey, you can use the curtains as napkins too.
