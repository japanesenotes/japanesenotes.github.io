## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Rain</span> falls off a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> and lands in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eye</span> where it turns to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> frost</span>. It turns to frost because it’s super cold outside and your body is freezing. The rain that fell off the tree turns to frost as soon as it hits your eye.
* Feel the rain hit your eye and then crystalize into frost immediately. The rain in your eye is wet, and then very cold as it becomes frost.
* This whole description is pretty emo. You came up with this whole emo <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> frost</span> idea because you are a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shemo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しも](https://jisho.org/search/しも)</span>). An emo who goes by she pronouns. 
* Picture yourself walking proudly, casting your frost gaze at all who you pass. Wow look at that frosty, cool shemo. She's sooooo cool! you hear them whisper. (Haha cool, get it? Because you're frosty and also a little sad, which is totally in when you're a teen.)
