## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span>, once stopped by a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> belt</span>, will begin to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stagnate</span>. This belt is a belt of water resistance, so the belt stops the tsunami. The belt has caused the tsunami to stagnate.
* Watch this belt as it stagnated the tsunami. See the belt glow as its enchantment activates, immediately stagnating the tsunami water.
* While you watch the tsunami <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stagnate</span>, you get ready for work. While you were watching this whole thing happening, you were tying your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tie</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たい](https://jisho.org/search/たい)</span>). Once the tsunami stagnated, you were all done tying your tie. And since the tsunami is no longer a threat, you’re ready to go to work.
* Look in the mirror at you in your tie. Put the finishing touches on your outfit and imagine going out into the world with your tie on, no longer afraid of any tsunamis. They’re all stagnant now thanks to that magical belt.
