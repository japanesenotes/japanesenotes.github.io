 * Down a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span>, a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span> comes and places a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> creeper</span> into your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span>. Your entire body is filled with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> feeling</span>. A feeling you don't like.
* This awful sliding drunkard filled your heart with his creeper vibes (and an actual creeper) and now you're feeling a lot of things. Probably bad things.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> feeling</span> wells up in you and bursts forth.

And you will have your revenge on this drunkard.
