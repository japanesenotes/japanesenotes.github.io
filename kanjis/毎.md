## Mnemonics
 * You see some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> windows</span>... you have a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gun</span>. What do you think you're going to do with this gun? Of course, you're going to shoot the windows... <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> every</span> single one of them.
* Make a point to make sure you get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> every</span> one, and don't miss any of them. Actually search around in your imagination for any more windows, because you want to stress it's important you hit <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> every</span> one.
* Now that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> every</span> single window is broken you feel pretty stupid because a bunch of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mi</span>ce (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まい](https://jisho.org/search/まい)</span>) come pouring in through them. You've made a way for them to get into your house. That wasn't smart.
* Now you need to shoot every one of the mice that came through those broken windows. You can't let any survive. You have to get every last one out of here!!
