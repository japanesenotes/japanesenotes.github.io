## Mnemonics
 * In the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> morning</span>, you use a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gun</span> on your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> nose</span> to make it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dry</span>.
* Don't worry, there aren't bullets in the gun. It's an air gun! So just imagine shooting the air into your nose every morning to make sure it's nice and dry.
* This technique for a nice <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dry</span> nose was invented by Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>)! Well, not him, but someone who worked under him. You see, he had a bit of a damp nose problem.
* Now the next time you manage to get your nose nice and dry, think back to our founding father Genghis Khan and thank him for where you are today.
