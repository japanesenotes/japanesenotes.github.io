## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Red</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> insect</span>s only bite <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> barbarian</span>s. If a red insect bites you then you have barbarian blood! Waaay back a barbarian was your aunt or uncle or great great grand pappy! But the insects kinda hurt, so it's a bit of a downside I guess.
* If you see a red insect follow it and see who it bites. Then you'll know that person is at least part barbarian.
* You follow the red insect and see it bite someone who must be a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> barbarian</span>! You look up at their face but all you can see are giant Ray-<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ban</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばん](https://jisho.org/search/ばん)</span>) sunglasses. You really want to look at his face to see what a barbarian looks like but those darn things are in the way!
* Thanks to those Ray Bans you still don't know what a real life barbarian looks like. After going to all the trouble of following a red bug too. What a waste.
