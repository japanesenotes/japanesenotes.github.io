## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> elephant</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> elephant</span> kanji are the same. But! This kanji has another meaning: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> phenomenon</span>. If you were the first person to see an elephant, you'd call it that too.
* Picture the first Japanese person to see an elephant. He stops dead in his tracks, points and screams out, What a phenomenon!
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Elephant</span>s are great and all, except that when they die they turn into elephant <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> zo</span>mbies (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぞう](https://jisho.org/search/ぞう)</span>). But you never see these zombies because the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>) has a special project in place that destroys all elephant bodies when they die.<br />Hint: The readings and meanings for this kanji match up really nicely. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぞう](https://jisho.org/search/ぞう)</span> is always for elephant and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span> is always for phenomenon. Remember it like this, the elephant is the zombie and the shougun keeps everyone from finding out about this phenomenon.
* Picture the shougun standing over a pit of zombie elephants. None of these are getting out on his watch, letting people believe in such crazy phenomenons.
