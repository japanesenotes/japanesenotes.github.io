## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Chinese</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> difficult</span> to find because they are so rare. Chinese turkeys are the rarest variety of turkey, so naturally, finding one is exceedingly difficult.
* Try and picture a Chinese turkey in your brain. Now imagine yourself trying to catch it, but you just can’t. It’s too difficult. The Chinese turkey is too elusive.
* Do you know the actual reason Chinese turkeys are so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> difficult</span> to find? Do you know how many Chinese turkeys there are in the world? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> None</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なん](https://jisho.org/search/なん)</span>). They don’t exist. How many Chinese turkeys are there? None.
* So this is why you had such a difficult time finding and catching one – there were none to be caught. Imagine the sadness you felt when you realized that there were no Chinese turkeys to catch and that none exist in this world.
