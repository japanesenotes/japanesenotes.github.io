## Mnemonics
 * If you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stand</span> in front of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span>, you’re going to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cry</span>. That tsunami is going to hit you hard, and rip you right off the ground on which you stand. And then you’ll cry like a little baby.
* Imagine getting hit with the full force of a tsunami. It slams into you and crushes every bone in your body. It hurts so much you cry.
* You know what else can make you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cry</span>? A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Na</span>zi (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [な](https://jisho.org/search/な)</span>). Nazis are mean, mean people, much worse than tsunamis. Nazis are bad news. Imagine a Nazi surfboarding on top of that tsunami that just hit you and made you cry. I imagine there’s nothing worse in this world than that.
* Picture this mean Nazi riding toward you atop of this tsunami wave. Hear him screaming, “Heil!” just before the tsunami wave crashes over you. Rotten Nazi.
