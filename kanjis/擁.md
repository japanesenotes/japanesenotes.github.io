## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> grasp this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lid</span> and when you raise it you see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> poop</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> (a turkey covered in poop). You can't help yourself, you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> embrace</span> the turkey. 
* Someone was obviously going to cook this poop turkey in a pot, and if you hadn't looked under this lid it surely would have died. Now as you embrace it you can hear the turkey weeping softly.
* As you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> embrace</span> the sad turkey it makes a funny sound and suddenly starts pooping <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>gurt (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よう](https://jisho.org/search/よう)</span>) all over you. But you don't want to stop embracing it! It's probably just scared still. But the more you squeeze, the faster the yogurt comes out of it!
* Imagine embracing the turkey as it covers you in yogurt poo. You hope it's yogurt at least. You aren't gonna taste it to find out. Maybe. Okay you might taste it a little.
