## Mnemonics
 * The light of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> is shining on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> guard</span> who's been on duty all night. The moon light makes him so warm and comfortable that he forgets where he is and starts to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> undress</span>. He thinks he's home! Everyone is going to see him take off his clothes!
* Picture a sleepy guard, bathed in moonlight, starting to undress. No! Keep your uniform on guard! Don't undress outside in the middle of the night!
* You can't seem to get the guard to stop <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> undress</span>ing so you throw some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> darts</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だつ](https://jisho.org/search/だつ)</span>) at him. You figure that even if the guard doesn't snap out of this weird sleepy trance, at least you can use the darts to stick his clothes to his body. Then maybe he won't be able to undress anymore. 
* Imagine throwing darts at a guard who's undressing himself. Imagine trying to aim for his pants so they'll be nailed to his body.
