## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> clown</span> is the only clown allowed to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accompany</span> you. You hate all clowns, and so does the rest of your town. But this clown is really good at building buildings, and he's allowed to leave his part of town and accompany you while you fix buildings together.
* I know it's been a long time, but try not to mix this one up with 	<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [部](https://jisho.org/search/部)</span>, if you can. Remember, the clown building is in another part of town and the clowns aren't supposed to leave. But the building clown is okay to accompany you through the rest of the city.
* He can only <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accompany</span> you for so long though and soon it's time to say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bye</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばい](https://jisho.org/search/ばい)</span>) again.
* Wave bye to the clown, he'll accompany you on your building job tomorrow, but right now he has to go home and be with the rest of his clown people. He can't accompany you after dark.
