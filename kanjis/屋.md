## Mnemonics
 * Some of your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> private</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> is on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span>, so you stick a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span> into it. Then on this private land you claimed, you build a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> roof</span>. Under the roof you also build some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shop</span>s and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> store</span>s.
* That's the natural next progression of claiming some land. Building a roof upon it and building some shops and stores inside. You'll see why in a moment.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> roof</span> covering the dirt is there so that the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ya</span>nkees (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [や](https://jisho.org/search/や)</span>) can play baseball year round. The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> store</span>s and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shop</span>s are there to sell hot dogs and Yankees memorabilia.
* You have yourself a whole Yankees stadium, and all it took was a roof and some shops / stores! If you build it, they will come.
