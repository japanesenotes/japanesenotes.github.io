## Mnemonics
 * Seeing a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mohawk</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> means the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> enemy</span> is nearby. You are from the dreadlock tribe and the mohawk tribe is your enemy. You’re deep in the heart of battle and winter has fallen. Now is the time to take out the enemy.
* Picture yourself holed up in a winter encampment, waiting to strike at the mohawk wearing enemies. Feel the cold around you as you scan the horizon for mohawks.
* You’re kind of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> techie</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てき](https://jisho.org/search/てき)</span>), so you have an advantage over your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> enemy</span>. You’re armed with night vision goggles and other cool tech gear as well. Being a techie certainly has its advantages.
* Imagine yourself all teched out like the techie you are. Hear the beeps and boops of all the technology you have at your disposal as you search for more mohawk enemies.
