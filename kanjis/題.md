## Mnemonics
 * If you use the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span>, you can find the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> correct</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> geoduck</span>. That's the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> topic</span> of today's lecture.
* Picture a teacher pointing to a chalkboard with a big pointer, and it says TOPIC.
* Our <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> topic</span> is actually mostly about using the sun to see different colored <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dye</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だい](https://jisho.org/search/だい)</span>) in the water.
* You use the dye in the correct sunlight to find the geoducks hiding under the sand. And once we master this topic, we'll move onto actually using dye to find them in the wild.
