## Mnemonics
 * You have an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> animal</span> and you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> it’s a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dog</span> to prevent it from going to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prison</span>. Dogs are the only animals that don’t have to go to prison. Your animal is not a dog, but you say it is to prevent it from going to prison.
* Imagine any animal that’s not a dog. Now imagine dressing it up like a dog so it doesn’t have to go to prison. Practice throwing your voice by saying “woof woof” aloud to help convince people that your animal is actually a dog.
* What is the name of your animal? Your animal is named <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Goku</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ごく](https://jisho.org/search/ごく)</span>). Yeah, like Goku from Dragon Ball Z. You don’t want your little Goku to go to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prison</span>, so you say that he’s a dog.
* Poor little Goku doesn’t want to go to prison either so Goku does his best to act like a dog even though he isn’t. How adorable.
