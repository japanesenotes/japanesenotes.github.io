## Mnemonics
 * You tie a piece of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> to your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> in order to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> maintain</span> proximity to it. The turkey likes to run away, so you tie a thread to it. This way you can hold the other end and maintain your turkey.
* Imagine holding onto a thread that is attached to a turkey. Feel the turkey tug against the thread as you struggle to maintain control.
* The reason the turkey is struggling is because there’s an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>) swooping down to attack the turkey. You try to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> maintain</span> control, but once you see the eagle as well, you let go of the thread.
* Now you and the turkey and the eagle are all bumbling about in pandemonium. You try to maintain order but it’s not possible. What a kerfuffle.
