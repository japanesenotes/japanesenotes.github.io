## Mnemonics
 * You take a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grain</span> and fashion it into a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gun</span> that is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> small</span>, earning you the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> title</span> of Small Arms Dealer (or SAD). Congratulations!
* This isn't exactly a title you're proud of, in fact, you're really embarrassed. Maybe you can make a name for yourself in something else so you can get a new title.
* Word of your SAD <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> title</span> makes it all the way to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>) and he travels out to see you. When he arrives at your door, with all of his fancy escorts, he hands you a plaque with your title on it.
* The plaque says, No one is more deserving of this SAD title. - Love, the Shougun.
