## Mnemonics
 * That special <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> woman</span> in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> life</span> will eventually take your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> surname</span> and make it her <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> family name</span> too. Traditionally, a woman will change her last name when she gets married and keep that name for the rest of her life. Her husband’s family name becomes her family name too.
* Imagine having your surname changed for the rest of your life. How do you feel about having a different family name? Is it a big deal to you or does it not matter much?
* Picture this special woman in your mind. She's changing her <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> surname</span> to yours and taking hold of your special <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sa</span>ber (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せい](https://jisho.org/search/せい)</span>) as well. And it's... it's splitting in two!
* Now you share a family name AND a holy blue saber! You can protect your legacy (and surname) hand in hand and saber in saber. (Or something like that.)
