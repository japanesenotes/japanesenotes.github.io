I know you like things that are bright, and I know you like plates too. Therefore, this bright plate should be more than enough to convince you to enter into an alliance with me.
* Look at this bright plate. Look at it. It’s awesome. It’s blinding. Hold it in your hands. Marvel at it. Wow. This plate is sweet.
* The person you are trying to get in an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alliance</span> with you is the captain of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> May</span>flower (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [めい](https://jisho.org/search/めい)</span>). You want to be in an alliance with the captain of the Mayflower because you really like boats. You want to ride on the Mayflower like, so bad.
* This Mayflower boat is the best boat you ever did see. Hear the ocean around it as it bobs in the water, full sails billowing in the wind. Boats are cool.
