## Mnemonics
 * We have the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> two</span> radical (though it's sort of slanted). What's two times the winter radical, if radicals are just a part of a kanji? Two times would be enough to create the entire kanji, which is also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> winter</span>.
* You could also think, Winter too instead of two. Because, this kanji is in fact <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> winter</span> too.
* This kanji is a little different from the radical <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [夂](https://jisho.org/search/夂)</span> though has the same meaning… but don’t let that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fool you</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふゆ](https://jisho.org/search/ふゆ)</span>).
* Try to spend a little extra time with this one - the mnemonic isn't as strong as it could be, so you'll need to add a little extra old-fashioned memorization to this soup if you want to remember it later. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふゆ](https://jisho.org/search/ふゆ) ふゆ ふゆ</span>...
