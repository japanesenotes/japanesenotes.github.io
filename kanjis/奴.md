## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> woman</span> sitting on that <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span> is actually a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dude</span>. Oh oops! You thought he was a woman because of his long hair and the way he was sitting. Maybe you shouldn't be judging people based on their looks!
* Dude, I can't believe you called that dude a woman. What's wrong with you?!
* You only found out this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dude</span> wasn't a woman when a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> do</span>g <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ど](https://jisho.org/search/ど)</span> ran up and the dude stood up. He started rubbing the dogs face saying, Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Not you! Me! I'm the best boy of them all. Because I am a dude, the best of all boys! HAHAHAHA!
* Look at the poor dog. He's not a dude and now he doesn't think he's a good boy, all because of this other dude. Was he sitting on the stool this whole time, waiting to make this dog feel bad? I guess you'll never know...
