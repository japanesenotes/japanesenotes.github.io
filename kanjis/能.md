## Mnemonics
 * You keep some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> private</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spoon</span>s on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> and they give you a special <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ability</span>. It's the ability to predict the future! The moon spoons reflect the knowledge of time and space into your brain. Now that's a cool ability!
* I wish I had this kind of ability... maybe I'll go up to the moon and try to steal your spoons.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ability</span> to predict the future makes you famous and now everyone knows your name: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> No</span>stradamus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [のう](https://jisho.org/search/のう)</span>)! And now that people know about your name and special ability, everyone will love you!
* Oh, you thought I was talking about that old Nostradamus, who also had the ability to predict things? Nah, you're way cooler than him.
