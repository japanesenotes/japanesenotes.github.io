## Mnemonics
 * You soak each <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> foot</span> in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> water</span> before going out in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> to take your first <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> step</span>. Stepping on the ground when it's been baking in the hot sun can burn your feet, so you're careful to make them wet with water before stepping outside even once.
* Imagine each step on hot, sun-baked asphalt. The water under your feet sizzles, leaving steaming footprints where you stepped from.
* Each <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> step</span> you take brings you closer to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> とうきょう</span>. Unfortunately, the sun keeps getting hotter, meaning you have to take breaks between steps more often, to get your feet wet with even more water. But you're determined to reach <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span>, no matter how many steps it takes.
* Each step is taking you closer to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span>. Don't forget that, no matter how hard it seems, don't lose your motivation to keep stepping forward toward your goal. ♡
