## Mnemonics
 * Having a foul <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span> will prevent you from getting into <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Heaven</span> where you would <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blossom</span> into an angel. If you have horns, you are not meant for Heaven and not blossom there. To blossom in Heaven, you must not have horns or a foul mouth.
* Swear like a sailor as you imagine yourself with some horns. You’re not going to blossom in Heaven. You’re going to blossom in Hell and become a demon.
* You don’t want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blossom</span> into a demon so you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> saw</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)</span>) off your horns with a saw. If you saw off your horns, maybe you can beg for forgiveness and have your foul mouth forgiven.
* Imagine taking a saw to your horns and sawing them off. Hear the reverberation of the saw in your skull as you painfully saw off your horns.
