## Mnemonics
 * <div><div><strong>Criticism</strong>&nbsp;is pointing at your finger at someone and comparing them with someone perfect.</div></div><div><div><i></i></div></div><br>If you use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> to point when you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> compare</span> things you're really just throwing around <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> criticism</span>. You should never need to point fingers when you're just comparing things. If you're pointing and picking and being mean, that's criticism.<br>
* Some criticism is okay, as long as it's constructive and it helps the person get better. But when you start pointing fingers, it's time to step back and try to not be such a jerk.
* If you're having trouble not giving out <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> criticism</span>, just think about how you would react if someone criticized you. You'd feel an embarrassed <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> he</span>at (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひ](https://jisho.org/search/ひ)</span>) rise throughout your body. That heat will cover your whole face.
* Before you throw criticism around, imagine that embarrassed heat. You don't want to feel that way, so why would you do it to someone else?
