## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> protecting your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> life</span> and the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> net</span> protecting your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span> are both protected by the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> constitution</span>.
* The constitution makes it so that everything you hold dear is locked away, nice and safe on a piece of paper, and no one can change the rules or hurt you without your say so. 
* Your country's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> constitution</span> is being protected by none other than <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ken</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けん](https://jisho.org/search/けん)</span>) the samurai, hero for hire.
* Picture Ken standing in front of your constitution. But keep a close watch, cause wily ol' Nic Cage is in the business of thievin' on constitutions.
