## Mnemonics
 * I have <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> five</span> things in my <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> I</span> need them all for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> me</span>. I own these five things, and I keep them in my mouth so people like you cannot take them from me.
* What five things would you keep in your mouth to protect them from me? Imagine these five things in your mouth and think of how important they are to you as you taste them on your tongue.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Me</span>, personally, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> I</span> am quite thirsty so I ask for some “<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> waga</span>” (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わが](https://jisho.org/search/わが)</span>). I have five things in my mouth, so it is hard for me to pronounce the word “water”. So it sounds like “waga” when I ask for it. “Coulg I pweash hab sum waga?! I deed waga!!”
* Imagine how you would sound asking for “waga” with your mouth full of five things. You can carry out this experiment in real life if you would like, just be careful not to choke, okay?
