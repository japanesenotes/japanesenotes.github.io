## Mnemonics
 * You put a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lid</span> on your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> father</span>. But, he won't taste good alone, so you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mix</span> in some other ingredients. They <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mingle</span> inside the pot with him.
* This may seem traumatic, but actually your father is surprisingly into it. Imagine him mixed in with all kinds of other things. It's important to note that this kanji is about things being mixed in, not so much about the action of mixing. That's another kanji. 
* With a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mix</span> of your father and other ingredients <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mingl</span>ing in your cooking pot, you lift up the lid... your father pops up. Your father is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>. He stares back at you with a big smile.
* I love mixing in with potatoes and tomatoes, your father <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> states. Turn up that temperature. I like to mingle with a bit more tingle.
