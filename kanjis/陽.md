 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span> has <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> easy</span> access to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sunshine</span>. It's big and tall, so the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sunlight</span> shines right onto its roof.
* You're standing on top of the building as the sunshine comes down. Its warm light fills your entire body as it covers the building with ease.
* Standing in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sunshine</span> for this long has worked up your appetite, so you take a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>gurt (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よう](https://jisho.org/search/よう)</span>) cup out of your bag and eat it.
* Feel the sunlight on your face and taste the yogurt on your tongue. What flavor is it? Try to imagine it as vividly as you can so that sunlight always tastes like yogurt from now on.
