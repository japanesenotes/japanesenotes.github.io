## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> original</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> geoduck</span> had a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> request</span>. He wants there to be more geoducks in the world!
* Remember, this is the OG = original geoduck. There are no other geoducks yet.
* The only person that would even hear the geoduck's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> request</span> was <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Gan</span>dhi (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がん](https://jisho.org/search/がん)</span>). Gandhi closed his eyes, sat down, and spread the geoduck's request to the rest of the world.
* People listened when Gandhi said, My friends. We must stop trying to eat the geoduck, and instead allow it to breed. Join me in this fast!<br />And that's why we have so many geoducks on the earth today. Thanks Gandhi.
