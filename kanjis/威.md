## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span> goes down a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span>, hits the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> and bumps into a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> woman</span>. Who is that woman? It's none other than her <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> majesty</span>.
* The problem is that you don't want to run into her majesty. That's a grave offense. Feel the fear that you're going to get your head lopped off from running into her.
* After you run into her <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> majesty</span>, her guardian <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>) swoops on you and pulls you off of her.
* Then it starts pecking at your eyes. Imagine fighting off an eagle trying to get at you.
