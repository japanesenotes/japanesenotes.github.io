## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> moon</span> kanji is made up of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> radical.
* This should be EZPZ as long as you know the radicals already!
* Since <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [げつ](https://jisho.org/search/げつ)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がつ](https://jisho.org/search/がつ)</span> are quite similar, we'll use one mnemonic to cover both of them. I expect your experience learning Japanese throughout the future will help you to memorize and differentiate between the two. When the moon goes down and goes away, everyone in the world <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gets</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [げつ](https://jisho.org/search/げつ)</span>) up, because that means it's going to be daytime soon!
* This one might not be as memorable at first, but if you think of the moon, and think about what people do when the moon is up, you'll come to sleeping. Then naturally you can think about what happens when the moon goes down... people <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gets</span> up!
