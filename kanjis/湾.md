* Picture all the famous gulfs you learned about in geography class. Most of them look like someone pressed a bow into them and dug out the land. (And just imagine they're red because the earth is bleeding, making the sand red.)
* How many tsunamis does it take to make a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gulf</span>? Just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> one</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わん](https://jisho.org/search/わん)</span>). If there were more, then no land would be left behind. It would all be taken into the sea.
