## Mnemonics
 * You take a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drum</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> branch</span> and... well, what else would you do? You would <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> drum</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beat</span> them together.
* A branch is just like a drumstick, so of course you're going to drum them together.
* Who loves to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> drum</span> things together and make a huge racket? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 子</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span>), of course.
* Kids can't get enough of it. Anything that makes a loud drumming noise or anything they can beat together is fun for them.
