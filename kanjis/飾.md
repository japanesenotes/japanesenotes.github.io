## Mnemonics
 * When you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eat</span> you want to see the shape of your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gun</span> from under a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> towel</span>, so you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> decorate</span> your house with them.
* Just picture it: an entire home decorated top to bottom with guns covered in towels, so only the outline shows. As your guests try to eat you say, Guess what gun this is?! Haha, you got it wrong, pull the towel back.
* If you actually <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> decorate</span> your house like this it will give people quite a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょく](https://jisho.org/search/しょく)</span>). In fact, they might be so shocked they run out of there screaming.
* Maybe you should be more conscious of other people when you decorate. Or at least, don't shock people into fainting or yelling or leaving. Guns do that, you know?
