## Mnemonics
 * The radical <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> run</span> and the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> run</span> are exactly the same!
* Make sure you know your radicals!
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> run</span> and run and run and suddenly you feel your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>) leave your body. Still running, you turn around and see your soul running a few steps behind you.
* Running really takes it out of you. In this case, it takes your soul out of you. Don't worry, when you stop your soul will collide with you again and everything will be okay. (Probably.)
