## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> feather</span> is on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span>, and they are attached <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> together</span>. You put a feather on a rice paddy to create a giant airplane. Flawed, sure. But, this rice paddy + feather is going to be one <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wing</span> of your amazing aircraft.
* Imagine a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wing</span> that is made of a rice paddy and a feather put together. Doesn't make sense, looks ugly, and probably will not fly. Imagine it anyways. It is your wing.
* To make the feather and rice paddy stick together you need some kind of sticking agent. This time we find the original bird that the feather came from and grab its eggs. We break the eggs open and use the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yolk</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よく](https://jisho.org/search/よく)</span>). It's pretty sticky, but still probably not aircraft safe. 
* Imagine using the yolks to stick everything together. It's all over your hands, and things are pretty nasty.
