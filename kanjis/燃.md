 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Fire</span> in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> nature</span> will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> burn</span> down everything in its path. In nature, there are no firefighters or anyone to contain the fire, so the fire will burn and burn until it has no fuel left to consume.
* Feel the fire all around you as it burns. You’re out in nature – the middle of a forest fire. Hear the woods burn and crackle as you feel the heat around you.
* What is the worst thing that could <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> burn</span> in this fire? Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nen</span>doroid (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ねん](https://jisho.org/search/ねん)</span>) collection. You've spent a lot of time and money collecting all these cool and rare and unique nendoroids and now they've all burned in the fire.
* Cry your eyes out as you smell the smell of burning plastic from the nendoroids. Worst. Day. Ever.
