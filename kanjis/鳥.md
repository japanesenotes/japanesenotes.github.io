## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bird</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bird</span> kanji are the same!
* As long as you know the radical bird you know the kanji bird.
* Think of a run of the mill <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bird</span>, whatever comes to mind for you first is fine. Then, your lovely bird swells. The shape of a face, then a hand, start stretching the bird apart until it explodes outward. Covered in blood and feathers is Mrs. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chou</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょう](https://jisho.org/search/ちょう)</span>).
* After bursting out of this bird, she turns her head sharply in your direction. I don't just own the streets, I own the birds too. I'm inside every bird, and I, Mrs Chou, can burst out at any time.
