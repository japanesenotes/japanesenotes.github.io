## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> hits your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mohawk</span> and it begins to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> drip</span>. The water from the tsunami continues to drip from your mohawk long after the tsunami has passed. There’s a lot of water in your hair now, so it’s probably going to drip for a while.
* Imagine having all this tsunami water in your hair. Hear it drip from your mohawk. Drip… drip… drip…
* Luckily, you’re a self-proclaimed <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> techie</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てき](https://jisho.org/search/てき)</span>), so you develop a device to stop the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> drip</span> drip dripping. This techie device of yours is like a hair dryer helmet. You put it over your mohawk, it does its thing, and your hair is dry! Being a techie sure does have its benefits.
* Feel the weight of this dryer helmet on your head as you listen to it whirr away. The dripping has finally stopped! Success!
