## Mnemonics
 * You're flying a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> helicopter</span> and you see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> woman</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> light touching her <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> waist</span>. She has both hands on her waist, like she's Wonder Woman or something. But it's the middle of the night. What is she doing?
* Imagine flying your helicopter closer to the woman, it's not so hard because you have lots of moon light to see in, and try to see why she's touching her waist.
* As you get closer you realize her <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> waist</span> looks weird and... puffy? You bring the helicopter down and see that the woman's waist looks incredibly <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cozy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こし](https://jisho.org/search/こし)</span>)! She has a blanket balled up and tied around her waist, she's holding it there with her hand, probably because it's cold out at night. But even with just her waist covered, she looks so warm and cozy! 
* Imagine how cozy your waist would be if you tried a nice warm blanket around it.
