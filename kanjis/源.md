## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> original</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> was the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> origin</span> of Japan. A big tsunami came and uncovered the islands of Japan. It's the origin of all life, as far as Japanese people are concerned.
* Picture the original tsunami used in the origin story of Japan. It was huge. Bigger than anything you've ever seen. And without it you wouldn't have your precious anime and mangos.
* This tsunami was also the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> origin</span> of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Gen</span>ji (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [げん](https://jisho.org/search/げん)</span>), from The Tale of Genji. Just think, without this origin, Japan wouldn't exist and neither would the first Japanese heartthrob, Genji!
* The origin of Genji was the origin of all Japan: a big ol' tsunami.
