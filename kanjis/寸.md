## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> measurement</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> measurement</span> kanji are exactly the same.
* If you make sure to know the radicals, you'll also make sure to know the kanji too, automagically.
* You want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> measure</span> something... something that will make you famous. You decide you'll measure the biggest mass in our solar system. We're talking about the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sun</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すん](https://jisho.org/search/すん)</span>).
* Imagine yourself deciding to do this. First step is to get a ridiculously long measuring tape. Then, you go up to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sun</span> and start measuring. You immediately start getting burned. Feel the pain of the heat from the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sun</span>. Think about how this really probably wasn't a good idea. You still go forward, though, doing your best to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> measure</span> the sun. Ouch, ouch, ouch.
