## Mnemonics
 * A group of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> private</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sword</span> guys are in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span>. You must <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> detain</span> them at once! Private sword guys are people who work for private companies and use their swords on people. They're basically paid assassins. And you're going to detain them!
* Imagine running into the rice paddy and detaining the private sword holders one by one. They won't get away this time!
* You're running out of steam and you're afraid you might not be able to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> detain</span> all of these guys when <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ryu</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りゅう](https://jisho.org/search/りゅう)</span>) from Street Fighter appears. He hates swords, and will only use fists because it's the honorable way to fight, so he starts helping you detain them!<br />He's also found a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> loo</span>phole (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span>) in the system and you don't have to be super gentle with these guys either. So detain them as forcefully as you want. It is your rice paddy they're in, after all.
* If Ryu hadn't shown up with this loophole you never would have detained all these private sword guys by yourself!
