## Mnemonics
 * There is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> prison</span> on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cliff</span> surrounded by <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> snake</span>s. Now that's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dangerous</span> place. If you try to escape the prison you either fall to your death off the cliff or get bitten/squeezed to death by the snakes. Can you think of anything more dangerous than this? I can't.
* Imagine a dangerous prison surrounded by cliffs and snakes. You wouldn't want to be here either, would you?
* Lucky for you, even though you're stuck in this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dangerous</span> place, there is hope. There is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>). All dangerous prisons have a key. You just have to find and steal it so you can avoid the cliffs and snakes!
* Imagine staring at the key dangling right outside of the dangerous prison you're trapped in. Would you take the chance and go for it?
