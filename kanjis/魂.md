## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cloud</span> floating above a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> demon</span> has its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soul</span> in it. If you can manage to get through to the demon, to make it see that it doesn't have to be evil, it might remember who it is and return to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spirit</span> it once was.
* Right now, however, the demon is looming over you, and you can't see anything in the cloud above its head. It just looks mad, like it's gonna pummel you or eat you.
* You shout out and beg its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soul</span> for help until, finally, you see the cloud take the shape of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> con</span>dor (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こん](https://jisho.org/search/こん)</span>). Aha! You were a condor before you became a demon! Remember who you are and turn back!
* POOF! Now there's a condor spirit floating in front of you, crying. Thank you, human. You've saved my soul! it says, and float/flies off and disappears.
