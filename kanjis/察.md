## Mnemonics
 * If you're on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> festival</span> you'll have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> guess</span> what's actually going on below you. You can kind of see that there are rides and maybe food? It smells like food. But you have to guess on the specifics because you're above it and not in it.
* Imagine being on the roof above a festival. Can you guess what's happening below you based on the sounds and smells?
* You were trying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> guess</span> by leaning over the edge of the roof, but you almost slip, and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sat</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さつ](https://jisho.org/search/さつ)</span>) down instead.
* Now imagine yourself just after you sat down. You close your eyes and open your ears and you can guess a lot better. You should have sat down earlier so you could concentrate on guessing better rather than endangering yourself.
