## Mnemonics
 * With a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lid</span>, you hit yourself in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> and then <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> kick</span> it like a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pathetic</span> loser. You kick the lid, even though it is your fault that you hit yourself in the mouth with it. It’s not the lid’s fault. You don’t need to kick it. You’re being pathetic.
* Imagine kicking this lid and with each kick you feel a little bit more pathetic. Your mouth hurts a lot too.
* You kick the lid one last time and it bounces off the wall and hits you in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eye</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あい](https://jisho.org/search/あい)</span>). How <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pathetic</span>. You are a pathetic mess. You should have never kicked the lid. Now both your eye and your mouth are in pain, you pathetic fool, you.
* Hold your eye with one hand and your mouth with the other. Feel them pulse in pain as you reflect on how pathetic you are today.
