## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Music</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> beans</span> make farts <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> plentiful</span>. And lucky for you, music beans themselves are also plentiful, so you can eat plenty of them to power your musical bean toots.
* Imagine dancing to your own plentiful bean music as you gorge on beans.
* Your music bean farts are too <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> plentiful</span> to leave your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ho</span>me (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほう](https://jisho.org/search/ほう)</span>). If you tried to leave your home you'd definitely fart all over people outside, so you keep your plentiful farts to yourself.
* Be polite! Keep your plentiful farts at home.
