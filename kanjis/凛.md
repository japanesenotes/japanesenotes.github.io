## Mnemonics
 * You're trying to open the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lid</span> of a manhole that's covered in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ice</span> by <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> jackhammer</span>ing it a bunch of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> times</span> but it's not working because it's just too <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cold</span>. It's so cold that your jackhammer is starting to ice up too. But you need to get this lid open so you try time after time after time!
* Imagine if it was sooo cold that no matter how many times you tried to jackhammer the ice of the lid for this manhole, it wouldn't crack open. 
* Each time the jackhammer hits the freezing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cold</span> ice it makes a high pitched <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rin</span>ging (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りん](https://jisho.org/search/りん)</span>) sound. It's actually really annoying to listen to but you really need to crack this ice open so you have to keep listening to it.
* If it wasn't so darn cold you wouldn't have to hear this horrible high pitched ringing sound because there wouldn't even be any ice to jackhammer through!
