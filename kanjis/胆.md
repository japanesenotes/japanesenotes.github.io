## Mnemonics
 * If you stay up for so long that you get to watch the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> go down and the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dawn</span> come, then people will say you have serious <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> guts</span>. Staying up that late is really hard, and not everyone can do it. If you don't have the guts to stay up, you'll just fall asleep and never see the moon and the sun switch places in the sky.
* Imagine the guts you'd have to have to stay up for so long that you see the moon and the sun switch places! A lot of guts!
* You were outside for so long, proving you had <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> guts</span>, that you also got a sweet <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たん](https://jisho.org/search/たん)</span>) out of it! It's a really deep tan though, and you probably need more guts if you ever want to do all that again.
* Imagine having the guts to stay outside to watch the moon and the sun and then getting a really deep tan from it.
