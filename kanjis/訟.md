## Mnemonics
 * Be careful what you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> public</span>, otherwise you might face a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lawsuit</span>. People will sue you for just about anything these days, so you really need to watch what you say in public, otherwise you might find yourself with a lawsuit on your hands.
* Think of all the things you could say in public that could get you stuck dealing with a lawsuit.<br />Oh my gosh! How dare you think those things?! You're lucky you didn't say them out loud in public, or I'd file a lawsuit against you myself!
* Any and all <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lawsuit</span>s need to be brought before the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>). Oh, you thought you'd get a judge or a jury? Nope, the Shougun decides your fate.
* You better hope what you said wasn't about the Shougun, or he's really going to use this lawsuit to destroy you.
