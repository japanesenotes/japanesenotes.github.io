## Mnemonics
 * If you shoot a tall stalk of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> beans</span> with an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> arrow</span>, the bean plant will go from tall to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> short</span>. When the beans are hit with that arrow, it severs the plant in two, and you are left with a stalk of beans that is much shorter than before.
* Picture yourself shooting this arrow. Imagine yourself nocking the arrow to the bow, and pulling the string back. That bean plant is not <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> short</span> enough, and you’re going to do something about it.
* All this shooting of arrows to make the bean plants more short is taking a long time. Since you’re out in the sun, you’re starting to get a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たん](https://jisho.org/search/たん)</span>). After the day is finally over, your tan is really, really dark.
* Imagine yourself being out in the sun for so long that you get an amazing tan. Your skin feels warm all over from all the sun you were getting throughout the day. Feel the warmth coming off of your tanned skin.
