## Mnemonics
 * The part of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grain</span> people <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> favor</span> the most is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> head of the plant</span>. You don't eat the stems and leaves of rice or wheat plants, right? You eat the head where the grains are.
* Imagine yourself walking through a field of rice plants. Now look very closely at the head of the plant in front of you. See the rice bunched up there? That's the good stuff.
* When you want to harvest the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> head of the plant</span> you'd like to eat, you need to use a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hoe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほ](https://jisho.org/search/ほ)</span>). Using a hoe, you can dig up the bottom of the plant without injuring the head.
* Imagine working in a field of rice and using a hoe so you don't injure the head of the plant. You're sweating and it's hot, but you keep at it.
