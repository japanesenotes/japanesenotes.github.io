## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> you have <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> inside</span> is your whole <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> supply</span>. When you're outside sewing and you run out, you just go inside, look through your supply, and pick a new one.
* Go inside your house or shed, it doesn't matter where, and look happily at your thread supply. You have thread in all sizes, shapes, and especially colors.
* You have this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> supply</span> because <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> No</span>stradamus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [のう](https://jisho.org/search/のう)</span>) had a prediction, saying you would. And that if you didn't keep a good supply of thread inside, you'd run out.
* Nostradamus says you should have a large supply of everything you use regularly. Thread, water, canned foods. You can't see the future, but he can, and if he's telling you to stock up on your inside supplies I think you should listen.
