## Mnemonics
 * You see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lip ring</span> and it's just so cute you have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flatter</span> it. That lip ring looks wonderful on you, Building<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さん](https://jisho.org/search/さん)</span>, you say.
* Flattering buildings is just as nice as flattering people, as long as they're okay with it.
* The building is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flatter</span>ed and you hear it shout, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ah</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あ](https://jisho.org/search/あ)</span>)! and blush. The entire building turns red.
* The ah the building made was actually quite loud, and since you've never heard a building speak before, it scared you pretty bad. But at least you know the building was flattered by your compliment (I think.)
