 * You <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> request</span> that <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rescue</span> you from the warmth of the other seasons.
* It's so hot. You hate it. You really hope winter will get your request and come early to rescue you.
* You get a note in the mail from winter! This is it, you're going to be rescued! You open the note and it says, I have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rescue</span>d you with this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cu</span>cumber (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きゅう](https://jisho.org/search/きゅう)</span>). A cucumber falls out of the note.
* This cucumber is supposed to be cool and refreshing enough to rescue you from the heat. I guess it was too much to expect winter to come early just for you. At least cucumbers are yummy.
