## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> big</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span> is standing in the middle of said rice paddy with an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> umbrella</span>. Who is this wacky leader? Why, it is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> I</span>. It is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> me</span>.
* Imagine that this leader is you. Be rough about it, because <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [俺](https://jisho.org/search/俺)</span> is the rougher version of I. You should only use it in casual situations or if you're a badass.
* Why am <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> I</span> standing in the middle of this rice paddy with an umbrella? I'm digging for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ore</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おれ](https://jisho.org/search/おれ)</span>).
* More accurately, I'm standing here with an umbrella so I don't get wet. My minions are doing the ore digging, but I am watching to make sure they don't slack off.
