## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Dirt</span> can <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> become</span> a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> castle</span> at any time. You just have to have the right conditions. The right time, the right people, and any patch of dirt can grow into a huge castle.
* Every great building, especially castles, started off as just a plot of dirt, you know? It's kind of inspiring what we can become.
* Once you turn dirt into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> castle</span>, that's all <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> she wro</span>te (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しろ](https://jisho.org/search/しろ)</span>). That's it. It's done. The story is over.
* Once a castle is there, there's really no turning back. So just remember that when dirt becomes a castle, that's all she wrote.
