## Mnemonics
 * You can't keep <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> big</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hair</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> private</span>, so you end up having to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> participate</span> in everything. Can you imagine people asking for volunteers and you trying to look inconspicuous with your big hair sticking up and out and all over? Of course they're going to notice you and make you participate.
* When you're thinking about your next hair style, if you don't like participating in things, you should think about something you can actually keep more private.
* You know who has big hair and loves to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> participate</span> in everything? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> San</span>ta-san (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さん](https://jisho.org/search/さん)</span>)! Well, his hair is more big on the bottom (it's a beard) than whatever you have on your head, but hair is hair. And he participates in present giving in every house in the world! See? Big hair = participation!
* Would you want to participate in Christmas if it meant looking like Santa and visiting every single house on earth?
