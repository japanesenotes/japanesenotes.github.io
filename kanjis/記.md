## Mnemonics
 * What you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> oneself</span> (yourself), you decide to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> write down</span>. Whether this is in the form of a journal, diary, or blog, you feel the need to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> record</span> these important thoughts in some way.
* Just imagine writing in a diary and saying everything to write aloud to yourself in your head. <br />Dear me, today I learned a lot of new kanji on WaniKani. It was the best. I love the crabigator sooooo much. Love, me.
* You need to protect what you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> write down</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> record</span> for yourself with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>). These are your special thoughts and feelings, you don't want anyone else to see! Lock them away with a key!
* Picture the key you use to keep what you write down a secret. What does it look like? How does it feel in your hands?
