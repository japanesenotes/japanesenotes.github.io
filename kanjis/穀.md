## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> samurai</span> hits the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> forehead</span>s of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grain</span>s with his <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> weapon</span> so the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grain</span>s will pop off and into his mouth. He doesn't want to kill the plants, so he's just skimming the grain's foreheads so they'll fall off and he can eat them.
* Picture the samurai taking out his weapon and spinning in a lightning fast circle. The forehead grains pop off and come raining into his open mouth.
* Phew, all of this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grain</span> is making the samurai thirsty, so he reaches in his bag and pulls out an ice cold, refreshing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Coke</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こく](https://jisho.org/search/こく)</span>).
* These grains aren't even cooked, they're just hard and raw, so the Coke really helps wash them down.
