## Mnemonics
 * You have a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> samurai</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span> on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stick</span>. On his flag is this symbol, the kanji for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> voice</span>. Why does he have that there? He feels like his Shogun isn't giving him and his fellow Samurai a voice, so he's brought a flag with the word voice written on it to protest.
* Imagine him and other samurai with their flags on sticks waving them around shouting things like we want a voice in politics! etc., etc.
* Once you start asking the samurai more specific questions about how he wants more <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> voice</span> he starts playing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こえ](https://jisho.org/search/こえ)</span>) with you. He doesn't really know what he wants, he's just here for the sake of protesting.
* Then you ask him out on a date. He still plays coy with you... one of those samurai, I guess.
