## Mnemonics
 * You can only give a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> kiss</span> of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> alcohol</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dairy</span>. If you add anymore than a kiss the dairy will curdle and you won't be able to drink it anymore. Bleh.
* Imagine trying to give more than a kiss of alcohol to dairy and watch it bubble and curdle and get all gross and chunky.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Dairy</span> isn't kept with other drinks, it needs to be placed on a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rack</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [らく](https://jisho.org/search/らく)</span>). I hope you've been using your dairy rack to store your dairy. If you haven't you should get one right away!
* Look at all your dairy products: milk, yogurt, cheese, all of it sitting nicely on your dairy rack.
