## Mnemonics
 * You see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> triceratops</span> standing in front of a full <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> and you can't help but see a really strong <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> resemblance</span>. The triceratops has that round frill thing behind its horns and it looks just like the round full moon. Who knew that a triceratops would resemble the moon!
* Look at the triceratops. Now look at the moon. See the resemblance? Uncanny, don't you think?
* The first person to see this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> resemblance</span> was the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>). That's why he decided to put a triceratops head with the moon behind it on his mon (family crest). Now he's known as the full moon dinosaur shogun, and he's very famous.
* Imagine being the Shougun and seeing the resemblance between a triceratops and the moon for the first time. You'd put that on all your stuff too, if you were him.
