## Mnemonics
 * You need to look a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eye</span> to gain a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mutual</span> respect for each other. Stand up straight, look the tree directly in its eye(s). If it looks right back, you know things are mutual.
* It's the same with humans, you know? If you want to have a mutual relationship you need to be able to look each other in the eyes. If you're too embarrassed, or you look down on them, then that isn't mutual respect!
* If your respect for the tree is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mutual</span> with the respect the tree feels for you, you'll be able to see the tree's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>). Right now its soul looks pretty sad, like it's trying to say, Why are your people cutting down all my friends? I thought we had a mutual understanding.
* This is basically a FernGully moment, you know? You can feel the tree's pain like it's your pain. It's that kind of mutual sharing of souls you need.
