## Mnemonics
 * If a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spirit</span> blesses your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> older brother</span> it's time to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> celebrate</span>! This isn't something that happens everyday to everyone's older brother. Yours is very good and very lucky. So celebrate with him!
* Imagine what celebrating would be like. Imagine an older brother too, if you don't actually have one.
* Unfortunately, the two of you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> celebrate</span>d too much, and you went a little crazy. The spirit grabbed your brother and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shook</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅく](https://jisho.org/search/しゅく)</span>) him. Shook him so hard his head popped off.
* Never celebrate too hard. Otherwise you'll always have to think about the time a celebration spirit shook your brother till his head fell off.
