## Mnemonics
 * This kanji looks like and means the same thing as the radical, which makes it particularly easy to remember.
* As long as you know the radical <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thousand</span> then you know the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thousand</span> as well!
* Remember the thousand crosses you got stuck under while learning the radical <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [千](https://jisho.org/search/千)</span>? You're still under it. Then, suddenly, someone pops his head over you and says Hey, I'll save you... but only for a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thousand</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cents</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span>). Go ahead and try to calculate what that would come out to. It's not that expensive, actually.
* But, the problem is even though you have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thousand</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cents</span> in your pocket, you can't get them out. You're stuck under all these crosses. So, your savior just shrugs and runs off, he won't help you anymore. Feel the desperateness of the situation to help yourself remember the kanji better. Hear the coins falling on the ground.
