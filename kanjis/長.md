## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> long</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> long</span> kanji are the same! <br />This kanji also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> leader</span>, because the longer a person is, the better a leader they'll be. Or maybe it was... the longer they've been somewhere? Whatever, longness = leaderness, you know?
* As long as you know the radical long, you know the kanji long as well.
* You see a very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> long</span> person. It's Mrs. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chou</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょう](https://jisho.org/search/ちょう)</span>), who has made herself long, like her street. I made myself long so I can watch more of the street, my domain. I'm the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> leader</span> of these streets. Watch yourself not-long person, says Mrs. Chou.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Long</span> isn't an idea that's easy to imagine in any specific sense, but you can try some other things too, as long as it gets associated with Mrs. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chou</span>. For the most part, when you see a kanji with the radical <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [長](https://jisho.org/search/長)</span> the reading will be <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょう](https://jisho.org/search/ちょう)</span>.
