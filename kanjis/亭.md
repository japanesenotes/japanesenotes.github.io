 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> restaurant</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> restaurant</span> kanji are the same!
* Know your radicals, yo!
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> restaurant</span> only serves <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tater</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てい](https://jisho.org/search/てい)</span>) tots. Really, would you ever want to go to a restaurant that didn't have tater tots? No.
* Imagine going to a restaurant and seeing a menu of all different types and styles of tater tots and nothing else. Even the drinks are tater tot based. Mmm mm.
