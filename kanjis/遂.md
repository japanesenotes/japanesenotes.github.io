## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> pig</span> riding on it will be able to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accomplish</span> anything.
* Imagine the pig scooting around. It is able to accomplish anything you can imagine (so go nuts with your imagination).
* It was even able to successfully <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accomplish</span> a feat that involved it jumping its scooter right into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> swi</span>ng (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すい](https://jisho.org/search/すい)</span>), swinging back and forth, then jumping off.
* Perhaps it even takes the swing all the way around in a full 360 degree rotation. This horned scooter riding pig can truly accomplish anything.
