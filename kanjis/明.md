## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> AND the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> are out? With both their light-powers combined, it's incredibly <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bright</span> outside.
* Look up at both of them, hanging out in the sky together. Make them super bright, so bright you have to shield your eyes.
* When do things start to get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bright</span> outside? I'd say when things start getting sunny, and that is the month of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> May</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [めい](https://jisho.org/search/めい)</span>).
* If your months don't match up with this too well (if you're down in the southern hemisphere, for example) then you'll have to imagine all this up in the Northern Hemisphere. Sorry about that, South Hemisphere ladies and gents.
