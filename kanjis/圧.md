## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> under a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cliff</span> is going to be under a lot of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pressure</span>.
* Imagine being down there with all that dirt. Imagine feeling the pressure closing in around you. It's so hard to breathe... h... help!
* The dirt being crushed under this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pressure</span> can't help but react by sneezing out, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Achoo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あつ](https://jisho.org/search/あつ)</span>)! This sneeze-inducing pressure probably has something to do with where earthquakes come from.
* Imagine you're the dirt being pressed from every direction, the pressure so strong, and it squeezes an ACHOO right out of you.
