## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> of water falls from a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bear</span> onto the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> and needs to be wiped up with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> towel</span>. Only a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> teacher</span> or an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> expert</span> could get away with getting close to this wet bear to wipe up after it.
* The expert is also your teacher, and she's showing you how to clean up after this bear.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> teacher</span> tells you to start with something smaller, after all, you're not an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> expert</span> yet. You have to practice on a wet <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>). I became a wet, dangerous animal expert by starting with sheep, you will too! your teacher says.
* Your teacher assures you this wet sheep is far less dangerous to clean up after than a wet bear. They're the expert, so you should listen and wipe up after that sheep.
