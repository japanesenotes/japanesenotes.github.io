## Mnemonics
 * You're on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> and suddenly someone throws a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hot pepper</span> at you and you have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dodge</span> it.
* Imagine riding your scooter, dodging multiple hot peppers as they're tossed at you. A few of them get stuck in the wheels and keep coming around and around, and you have to dodge them too.
* As you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dodge</span> the hot peppers, you feel a strong <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> he</span>at (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひ](https://jisho.org/search/ひ)</span>) fill your body. You can't tell if this heat is from the effort from dodging or if you didn't dodge right and one of the hot peppers touched you. Or maybe the scooter is overheating.
* Feel the heat flow through your body. It's getting harder to dodge as the heat grows and you start sweating!
