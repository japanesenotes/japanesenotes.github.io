## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spoon</span> is planting <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> so that one day this place may be full of beautiful <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flower</span>s.
* It's kind of weird that the flowers radical is only a part of the flower kanji, but you'll make do. Just focus on the fact that the leader is planting all these flowers for a bigger picture thing (that's what leaders do). He wants there to be flowers for future generations as well, because he's a nice dude like that.
* The leader can't stop planting <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flower</span>s though. He's going crazy. Maybe it's the pollen? He comes up to someone named <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Hannah</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はな](https://jisho.org/search/はな)</span>) and starts planting flowers in her face, probably killing her in the process.
* Do you know anyone named Hannah? Any famous people, perhaps? Try to come up with someone you know of named Hannah that you can imagine to be in this mnemonic, to help you remember it better.
