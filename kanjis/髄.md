## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bone</span>s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> have</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> that moves through the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bone marrow</span> inside them.
* If you think about it, bone marrow is really just a road for tiny blood scooters.
* If you put your ear really close a bone with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> marrow</span> still in it, you'll hear the scooters going <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> zuwee</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ずい](https://jisho.org/search/ずい)</span>) as they move the blood around inside there.
* That's how doctors can tell if there's something wrong with your bone marrow. If they can't hear the zuuwee of the scooters, you're gonna die soon. I mean, maybe, I'm not a doctor.
