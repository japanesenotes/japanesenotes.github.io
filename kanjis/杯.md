## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> not</span> a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cup of liquid</span> or a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> counter for cups</span>. Don’t get them mixed up. The last time you tried making a cup out of a tree to count your throat got filled with splinters when you used it. There wasn't even any liquid in it.
* Imagine cutting a tree into a cup of liquid and focus on the pain in your throat when you try to actually use it. Instead you kick the tree and angrily count cups of liquid in your head, because they simply are NOT the same.
* Another way to remember the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> counter for cups</span> using a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cup of liquid</span> would be by creating and memorizing a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hai</span>ku (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はい](https://jisho.org/search/はい)</span>) about them. Aren’t haikus useful?
* Think of a haiku about a cup of liquid and a counter for cups. Use that haiku to help remember this kanji.
