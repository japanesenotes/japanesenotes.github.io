## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Flowers</span> are growing out of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> and over your pet <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> pig</span>'s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> forehead</span> and it's causing the poor thing to live in total <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> darkness</span>. The flowers are hanging down over its eyes and won't let any light in at all. And some of the flowers seem to be growing directly out of the pig's forehead too. The pig has just been wandering and bumping into things all day because of it.
* Imagine being a pig with flowers hanging down off your forehead and into your eyes so that darkness was all you knew. It's very sad, actually.
* To end the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> darkness</span> you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mow</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もう](https://jisho.org/search/もう)</span>) the flowers. You have to drive your lawnmower over its head too, because they're growing out of its forehead too. They'll grow back soon though and cover your pig's world in darkness once again and you'll have to do it all over again.
* Imagine mowing the darkness away. Be careful! If you mow the pig's eyes, the darkness will last forever!
