## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> village</span> you always think of first is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> home village</span>.
* Why would you ever talk about the village where someone else was born? Answer: you wouldn't. Everything is always about you.
* You go back to your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> home village</span> in a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> saddle</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さと](https://jisho.org/search/さと)</span>). You can't take a car or a train there, it's really in the middle of nowhere. So you have to ride a horse, so break out that old saddle and go visit your parents.
* Close your eyes and imagine being on a saddle, heading back to your home village right now. Feel your butt and legs chafing. Eh... that's not such a great memory, now that you think about it.
