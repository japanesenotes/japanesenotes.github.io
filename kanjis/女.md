## Mnemonics
 * The radical for <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> woman</span> and the kanji for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> woman</span> are exactly the same.
* That means if you know your radicals well, you know the meaning of this kanji as well! How swell.
* When you think of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> woman</span>, think of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Jo</span>-Anne (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょ](https://jisho.org/search/じょ)</span>), though she usually goes by just Jo.
* Whenever the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょ](https://jisho.org/search/じょ)</span> comes up, we will use the character Jo-Anne. She's quite a short woman, which is to help us differentiate <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょ](https://jisho.org/search/じょ)</span> from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょ](https://jisho.org/search/じょ)う</span> (who is the giant, oafish farmhand Jourm). <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょ](https://jisho.org/search/じょ)</span> is a smaller lady, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょ](https://jisho.org/search/じょ)う</span> is a giant man.
