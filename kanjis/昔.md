## Mnemonics
 * You’ve been playing <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> blackjack</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> since <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> long ago</span>. This is the longest game of blackjack you’ve ever played and it feels like ages since you started. You’ve been sitting out in the sun playing blackjack since long, long ago.
* Imagine yourself playing a never-ending game of blackjack out in the hot sun. You’re sticky, sweaty, and tired. But all you can do is continue to play your game of blackjack. It’s miserable.
* Once you finally finish the game, you walk the long walk back home, in the sun, barefoot, on a dirt road that hasn’t been maintained since <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> long ago</span>. Your feet are all sweaty from being out in the sun, and walking on this dirt road gives you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> muck ashi</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [むかし](https://jisho.org/search/むかし)</span>). Your ashi (feet) are all mucky and muddy from the combination of dirt and sweat. Your muck ashi are really gross, man.
* Imagine your muck ashi, all dirty and muddy from walking on that old road from long ago. Feel the muck between the toes of your ashi, squishing with every step. Hear the sound the mud makes as it slides between your sweaty mucky toes.
