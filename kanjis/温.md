## Mnemonics
 * After a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span>, any <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> plate</span> left out in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> will be sure to get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> warm</span>. The tsunami knocked this plate out of the kitchen, and now it’s just sitting outside in the sun. The sun heats things, so the plate is getting really warm.
* Right after the tsunami, this plate was wet, but the sun is warming and drying the plate. Imagine looking at the plate and seeing the beads of water evaporate off it as it warms up. Feel the warm steam on your face as this happens.
* The plate starts to get so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> warm</span> that you could fry an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> on</span>ion (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おん](https://jisho.org/search/おん)</span>) on it. Who doesn’t love fried onions? That plate sure is warm enough, so start cookin’ ‘em!
* Imagine yourself frying onions on this plate warmed by the sun. Smell the onion smell as the onion fumes get into your eyes and your sinuses. It makes your eyes water as you are very sensitive to onions.
