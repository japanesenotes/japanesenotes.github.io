## Mnemonics
 * You have a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> big</span> guy here, with an extra <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> of something below his thigh, hanging down. That's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fat</span> right there. He's so fat he has things of fat hanging off his fat.
* Maybe you should touch the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fat</span> below his leg just to see what it is... feel it, and squeeze it. It'll help you to remember that this kanji means fat.
* This poor <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fat</span> guy has trouble with a lot of things. One of the things he has the most trouble with is tying a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tie</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たい](https://jisho.org/search/たい)</span>).
* Imagine him trying to tie the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tie</span> but he can't lift his hands around to do it. You have to help him out. Another thing that might help you to remember this kanji's reading is that it's the same reading as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [大](https://jisho.org/search/大)</span> (or, one of the same readings). Similar kanji often have similar readings, which is a good thing to know when you have to guess (it's true with this one, anyways!).
