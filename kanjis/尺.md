## Mnemonics
 * This <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shrimp</span> is the exact length of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shaku</span>, or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Japanese foot</span>. That’s how they came up with this form of measurement. They measured the length of this shrimp and it was the length of a Japanese foot which they deemed the shaku. It’s equal to 30.3cm, very close to one imperial foot.
* Imagine this foot long shrimp. It’s pretty big. Imagine it squirming about making a “shaku shaku” sound as it worms about.
* How is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shaku</span>, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Japanese foot</span>, pronounced by <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shaq</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゃく](https://jisho.org/search/しゃく)</span>) in Japanese? Why Shaq pronounces it shaku. It’s pronounced shaku in both English and Japanese.
* Imagine Shaq dribbling the shrimp like a basketball, saying “shaku, shaku, shaku” every time he bounces the shrimp.
