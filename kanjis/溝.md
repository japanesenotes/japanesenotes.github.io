## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Tsunami</span> vs <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lifeguard</span>. Who will win? After the water drains away, we find the lifeguard in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gutter</span>.
* To be fair, it's pretty obvious who would win. Nobody knows what that lifeguard was thinking.
* In the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gutter</span> is a lifeguard, so Emperor <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span> decides to survey the damage.
* This lifeguard didn't believe in the power of kanji learning, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち]([こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち)</span> says to the press. He was punished by the great Crabigator, who sent its tsunami as a warning for all.<br />Hint: when you see the lifeguard radical, the reading is probably going to be <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)</span>.
