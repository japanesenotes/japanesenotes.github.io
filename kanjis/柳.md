## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> that is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stamp</span>ed with one pattern, then <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stamp</span>ed with another pattern, over and over, is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> willow</span> tree. 
* A willow tree is a tree that looks like it's on repeat over and over again. It also looks nice on a stamp. Note that the first stamp is kind of an ugly looking backwards stamp, and the second stamp is the normal stamp radical.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ryu</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りゅう](https://jisho.org/search/りゅう)</span>) from Street Fighter really loves <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> willow</span> trees. Ryu loves them so much that he makes out with them. Ryu is open mouth kissing a willow tree. You are watching this. It is happening.
* Watch Ryu as he French kisses this willow tree. Hear him slurping and moaning in ecstasy. Why are you watching this? This is gross. Wait – is this turning you on!? Ew.
