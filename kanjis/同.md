## Mnemonics
 * There's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mustache</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span>. Upon closer inspection, you see that the mustache on the ground is exactly the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> same</span> as yours!
* Pick up the mustache, hold it up next to your face in front of a mirror. It's unbelievable, but it's the same in every way, down to the last hair.
* When we need to remember the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [どう](https://jisho.org/search/どう)</span>, we use the word doughnut.<br />While this is already strange enough, you notice something stranger. Over a couple feet away is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dou</span>ghnut (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [どう](https://jisho.org/search/どう)</span>) who also has the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> same</span> mustache as you (and the one that fell on the ground). The doughnut looks at you for a moment, then scampers off. This doughnut must be a mutant because normally doughnuts don't move.
* If it helps, imagine hundreds or thousands of doughnuts all around you with the same exact mustache. First of all, it's terrifying to be surrounded by thousands of mutant doughnuts. Secondly, it's really weird they all have the same mustache as you.
