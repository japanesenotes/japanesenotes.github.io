## Mnemonics
 * Put a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> on <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ice</span> and it will only get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> semi</span> frozen. You add more ice, and it stays the same. Only some of it will freeze. What the heck!
* Imagine covering a turkey in ice and every time you check it, it's only semi frozen. It doesn't matter what you do, it just refuses to freeze all the way through.
* Finally you realize it will only <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> semi</span> freeze because it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> June</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゅん](https://jisho.org/search/じゅん)</span>)! It's too hot out for your turkey to freeze all the way. The ice keeps melting off the top and semi thawing it!
* The lesson is to never try to freeze something in June. If you do it will only semi freeze.
