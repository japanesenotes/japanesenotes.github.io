## Mnemonics
 * Taking <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> orders</span> from a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> geoduck</span> will place you into enemy <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> territory</span>. Geoducks make terrible commanders, so if you take orders from one, expect to end up in unknown territory, potentially even enemy territory. Be prepared.
* Imagine this geoduck shouting orders at you to march into enemy territory. See its gross body as a mouth forms and starts shouting out orders.
* Not wanting to end up dead in enemy <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> territory</span>, you decide to escape this geoduck leader by getting on a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> row</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りょう](https://jisho.org/search/りょう)</span>) boat and rowing your way outta there. The geoduck commander orders you to halt your escape, but you still get in your row boat and row away.
* Feel yourself in the row boat as you imagine rowing away to safe territory. Hear the geoduck in the background shouting at you from shore, ordering you to return to land.
