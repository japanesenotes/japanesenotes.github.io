## Mnemonics
 * If you look for a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leaf</span> among the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hills</span> you will notice they are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scarce</span>. The hills have no trees around them, so there are no leaves. The leaves are scarce here on the hills.
* Imagine being on the hills. You want a leaf to find and take back as a souvenir but there are none. Imagine looking feverishly for a leaf even though you don’t really expect to find one.
* Still looking for a leaf, you determine that they are far too <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scarce</span> to find here. Just before you give up, you discover a giant <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bow</span>ling (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼう](https://jisho.org/search/ぼう)</span>) ball. As you pick it up, another one comes thundering down the hill knocking over a tiny tree.
* Leaves are scarce here because someone is using these hills for their bowling. The bowling balls knock over everything, and leaves can't grow.
