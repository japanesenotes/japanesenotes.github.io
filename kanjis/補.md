## Mnemonics
 * There is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spirit</span> at your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> wedding</span>. It's there as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> supplement</span> to the guests because not enough people came.
* It's weird that you supplemented your wedding guests with a spirit or two, but even if you hadn't invited them, they may have showed up anyway.
* Along with the spirits to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> supplement</span> your wedding guests, you made everyone carry a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hoe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほ](https://jisho.org/search/ほ)</span>). That way no one had to bring a date, they carry a garden hoe as a supplement and no one feels bad about being dateless. Everyone is!
* Maybe you should supplement your wedding with other things next time... instead of spirits and garden hoes.
