## Mnemonics
 * This is the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Mama</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Street</span>. You've been given notice <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beforehand</span>.
* You were given notice beforehand about the fact that this is Mama Street. It's important to know, because on Mama Street everybody acts like mamas.
* Despite learning that this was Mama Street <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beforehand</span>, you still brought your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よ](https://jisho.org/search/よ)</span>) yo here.
* As you take your yo-yo out on Mama Street, you're swarmed by mamas, who take the yo-yo away while telling you that's dangerous and you could put an eye out with that. This is why you were warned beforehand, so you wouldn't do dumb things like bringing a yo-yo to Mama Street.
