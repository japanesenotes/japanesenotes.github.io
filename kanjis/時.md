## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> is used in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> temple</span> to tell <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> time</span>. They don't have clocks or cell phones, they have sun dials and good old fashioned looking up and seeing where the sun is right now.<br />This also can mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> o' clock</span>, as in five o'clock It's used when measuring what time it is in Japanese.
* Imagine being in a temple and realizing you don't know what time it is. Never fear! Look on up at the sun. Ah, yes. Blinding noon.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Time</span> in a temple makes you think of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Je</span>sus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span>). Specifically, Jesus being able to perform time travel magic. He winks at you, goes back to the dinosaur ages, where he wrestles a T-rex. Then, he goes to WWII era and punches Hitler in the mouth.
* Imagine him going to all kinds of different times and also make sure you're specifically imagining Jesus doing all these things. Put these two together and you'll remember the reading in no time. (Haha, get it?)
