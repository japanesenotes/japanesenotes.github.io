## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> specialty</span> is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span>ping people with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> by <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bind</span>ing them! You can drop anyone as long as you have enough thread to restrain them. It doesn't matter how much they fight, you'll get them to drop!
* Imagine if your specialty was dropping people by binding them with thread. You'd be such a weird person.
* If you're going to be a weirdo who likes to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bind</span> people, at least make sure that they land on their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> back</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばく](https://jisho.org/search/ばく)</span>) when they DO drop. Landing on your head or your boobs really hurts. So please at least try to make them land on their backs!
* Imagine how you would bind someone so that when they drop they land on their back instead of somewhere more painful. How would you do that?
