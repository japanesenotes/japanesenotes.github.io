## Mnemonics
 * Imagining one’s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> self</span> without a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span> can make it hard to draw <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> breath</span>. Without a heart, you’d have no blood pumping and you would start to die. This would make it increasingly harder to draw breath and get oxygen to stay alive.
* Imagine trying to live without a heart. You couldn’t. Your blood stops flowing and your body shuts down. You would no longer be able to draw breath.
* You know how when people are unconscious and their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> breath</span> slows or comes to a stop, they use smelling salts to revive them? Well a smelly <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そく](https://jisho.org/search/そく)</span>) can work just as well. Socks get really stinky and their stench is powerful enough to revive someone who isn’t drawing breath.
* Imagine smelling this smelly sock. Imagine the smelly stench of the dirty sock wafting up into your nostrils and filling your lungs with its odor. Gross.
