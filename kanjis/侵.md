## Mnemonics
 * There is a tiny <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> on <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Wolverine</span>’s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> forehead</span> sitting on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span> and commanding his troops to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> invade</span> Wolverine’s brain. These tiny soldiers are going to invade Wolverine’s body in an attempt to destroy him. The leader himself isn’t going to invade Wolverine’s brain, he’s just going to sit on the stool and supervise.
* Imagine the little leader sitting on Wolverine’s forehead as he shouts “Invade! Invade invade! Invade his brain and destroy the Wolverine!”
* Soon they realize that they cannot <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> invade</span> Wolverine through his head so they travel down to his leg and try to enter through his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shin</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しん](https://jisho.org/search/しん)</span>). The little soldiers take a big knife and slice open Wolverine’s shin in order to invade his body.
* See the little soldiers slicing open Wolverine’s shin as Wolverine grunts in pain. Getting your leg cut open is not a comfortable thing, even for someone as manly as Wolverine.
