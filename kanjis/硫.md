## Mnemonics
 * There are <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stone</span>s that smell like <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> trash</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> river</span>. You reach in and realize these rocks are made of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sulfur</span>. Even the flow of this water can't hide the stink of these sulfur rocks.
* If you haven't smelled sulfur before, it smells a bit like rotten eggs. Something that definitely belongs in the trash.
* You throw the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sulfur</span> rock as hard as you can, but it hits someone in the back of the head. Oh no, it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ryu</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りゅう](https://jisho.org/search/りゅう)</span>) from Street Fighter. You try to apologize and explain that you just didn't want this stinky trash rock, I mean, sulfur rock near you. You didn't know he was there.
* Ryu looks down at you, holding the sulfurous rock in one hand. Then he uppercuts you with it! Shoryuken!
