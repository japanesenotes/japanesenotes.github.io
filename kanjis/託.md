## Mnemonics
 * They <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> if you put things on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span>, <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> seven</span> things to be exact, that’s the best way to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> consign</span> goods to someone. They say if you consign seven things to someone, you should send them over on a slide. Slide ‘em on down. All seven of ‘em.
* Imagine what seven things you consign over to this other person for safekeeping. Visualize them in your head as you slide each one down the slide.
* One of the seven things you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> consign</span> over to this guy is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tack</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たく](https://jisho.org/search/たく)</span>). It’s the sharpest tack you’ve ever seen. You slide the tack down the slide. Good thing no one is on the slide now, sitting on that tack would hurt.
* Let’s imagine what it would be like to hit this tack while sliding on the slide. It would hurt. Good thing you are consigning it over to someone. Probably safer for everyone that way.
