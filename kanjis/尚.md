## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> triceratops</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mustache</span> will go on talking forever. Every time you think he's done he says, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Furthermore</span>... and keeps going. Something about a mustache on a dinosaur makes him kind of a jerk, but he's held in such high <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> esteem</span> that no one ever interrupts him.
* Imagine this mustachioed triceratops. He probably has a monocle and a fedora too. Every time you think you can talk or leave he says, Furthermore again. Come on guy, how much do you have to say?
* Why don't you just interrupt this mustache triceratops while he's saying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> furthermore</span>? Because he's the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun's (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>) pet. If you interrupt him you'll probably be put to death or something. Just let him keep going and hope he runs out of furthermores to talk about.
* Furthermore! the mustachioed triceratops points at the Shougun, He is the best Shougun we'll ever have. And he'll let me talk forever OH OH OH!
