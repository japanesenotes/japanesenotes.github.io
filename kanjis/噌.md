## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> is wearing a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mask</span> so people won't realize you're the one being so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boisterous</span>. You want to be loud and rowdy, but you don't want anyone to know it's you. If you cover your mouth with this mask, people won't know you're the one being so boisterous.
* Go put a mask on right now, cover everything around your mouth so it's hard to tell who you are. Now go outside and be as boisterous as possible!
* You're being anonymously <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boisterous</span> outside when suddenly someone shoves <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> so</span>ap (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そ](https://jisho.org/search/そ)</span>) in your mouth! I don't know who you are, but you're much too boisterous! Wash your mouth out with that soap! they yell.
* Using your boisterous mouth, taste the disgusting soapy soap. The soap bubbles are already filling your mouth and stinging your tongue. This is the punishment for boisterous hooligans.
