## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Loiter</span>ing around with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> brush</span>? Sorry, but you're breaking the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> law</span>. If you have a brush, that's okay. If you're loitering, that's okay. If you combine the two? Well... watch your back.
* Imagine a police officer coming for you. He's yelling at you because you have a brush and you're loitering. He grabs you, throws you to the ground, telling you what you're doing wrong.
* Where were you loitering with your brush, breaking the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> law</span>? Right outside the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ritz</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りつ](https://jisho.org/search/りつ)</span>) Hotel. You'd think that it would be okay since you were staying there, but the law is the law.
* Imagine the hotel staff watching as you get thrown to the ground. You yell won't the Ritz do anything to help me?? They won't.
