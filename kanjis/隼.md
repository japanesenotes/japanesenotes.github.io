## Mnemonics
 * If you tie a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> you can trick everyone into thinking it's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> falcon</span>. The cross will stretch its wings out just enough for it to stop looking so fat and turkey like, into a super cool bird of prey.
* Imagine tying a cross to this turkey and see it transform into an elegant falcon. Majestic.
* You decide to name this new <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> falcon</span> after your favorite falcon-like ninja. Ryu <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Hayabusa</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はやぶさ](https://jisho.org/search/はやぶさ)</span>) from <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryu_Hayabusa>Ninja Gaiden</a>! Picture your fat turkey falcon and Ryu Hayabusa teaming up Banjo and Kazooey style. Yeah, that's the dream right there.
* Picture your falcon Hayabusa and the real... ok fake.. Hayabusa running around together and kicking butt.
