## Mnemonics
 * If the snow in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> was <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> red</span> instead of white, that’d be a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> strange</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> change</span> wouldn’t you say? White snow is normal, red would just be strange. Can you imagine what it would be like if the winter snow changed to the color of red?
* This strange change radical is a modified version of the red radical. Use that to remember it. It’s a strange change from the normal red radical.
* You know what else is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> strange</span> thing to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> change</span>? The color of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hen</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [へん](https://jisho.org/search/へん)</span>). Hens are already red, so we’d change them to another color, like purple. That would be a pretty strange color for a hen, right?
* Imagine if hens were purple, or even other strange colors. It would be an unexpected change. Imagine this army of rainbow colored hens strutting around and clucking up a storm.
