## Mnemonics
 * It is impossible to play blackjack TOGETHER.<br><br>The card game fish are best at is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> blackjack</span> because they can easily hold the cards with their <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fins</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> together</span>. In blackjack you don't have to have a huge hand, full of cards. It's just a few, so fish fins can keep them together and just hit or stay.
* Imagine a fish trying to hold a full hand of cards together. Impossible! Fish don’t have fingers to keep them spread properly. Now imagine a fish trying to hold two cards together and nodding to hit. It's much easier to keep things together this way!
* Once a year trillions of fish get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> together</span> in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょう](https://jisho.org/search/きょう)</span></span><span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [と](https://jisho.org/search/と)</span> to play blackjack. They have a huge tournament there once a year.
* Imagine a bunch of fish gathering together in <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょう](https://jisho.org/search/きょう)と</span> to participate in this blackjack tournament. With so many fish all together in one place, it probably smells pretty fishy.
