## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> forehead</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> origin</span> for the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> measurement</span> for your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crown</span>! If you measure somewhere else on your head for a crown it won't fit.
* Imagine someone putting a tape measure around your forehead and taking careful measurements for your crown. They better not mess up, or you'll have them put to death!
* You want your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crown</span> to be just like Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span>'s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>), which was more of a cap. He's your hero though, because he ruled over the most people, so you want yours to match his measurements.
* Why don't you go look up what Genghis Khan's crown/cap looked like. Then try to imagine how it would look atop your head.
