## Mnemonics
 * An altered <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bird</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crow</span>! They look like birds but they're bigger and darker and smarter!
* See that bird? Wait, that's not just a bird, it's a crow!
* If you can't tell just from looking at it that it's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crow</span> and not a bird, walk up to it and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> caress</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [からす](https://jisho.org/search/からす)</span>) it with your hand! If it caresses you back, it's a crow! If it freaks out and flies away or pecks your face, it's a normal bird. Crows are really smart and like affection. That's what makes them so cool!
* How many crows have you caressed today?
