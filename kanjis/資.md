## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> next</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> will be yours, but this shellfish will be mine. These are the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> resources</span> we have to share and distribute.
* Our resources are based around a system of trading shellfish. It's not that weird, plenty of ancient societies used shellfish as their main resource!
* You save up all of your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> resources</span> so you can buy a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>). You bring a big sack of your shellfish resources to the market and finally get to pick out that sheep you've had your eyes on for months.
* Of course you're going to use your resources to get a sheep. You're living in a time when shellfish are used to trade for goods and services!
