## Mnemonics
 * Those that can only eat a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> part</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> are probably a bit <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> poor</span>.
* Poor people can't even afford a whole shellfish. They have to settle with just a part.
* And since they are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> poor</span>, they are getting these shellfish parts from the trash <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bin</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [びん](https://jisho.org/search/びん)</span>). It's quite unfortunate.
* Imagine a poor person going through a garbage bin to find only a part of of a shellfish. What a sad sight.
