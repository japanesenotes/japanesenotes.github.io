## Mnemonics
 * You give your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> so that it can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> advance</span>. The turkey was trying and failing to walk through a crowded street, so out of the goodness of your heart you gave it a scooter so it could advance.
* Imagine picking up the turkey and putting it on your scooter. Of course, you give it your helmet as well, safety first.
* You wave as the turkey <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> advance</span>s into the street at top speeds, collides with a car, and scrapes up its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shin</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しん](https://jisho.org/search/しん)</span>) almost immediately. Ah!
* Silly turkey, you can't advance that fast, of course you'll hurt your shins. It's better to advance slowly, but I guess I couldn't expect you to know that.
