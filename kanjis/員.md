## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> member</span> of the invertebrate family. Yes, shellfish do have mouths, look it up!
* Imagine a shellfish opening and closing its mouth, talking to you and telling you what a proud member of its family it is. It’s a strange sight, but picture it in your mind anyway.
* If you were a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> member</span> of the same shellfish family, you'd be able to go to the special shellfish <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inn</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いん](https://jisho.org/search/いん)</span>). Every species has a members-only inn.
* Imagine trying to go to the shellfish inn. Imagine all the members-only signs telling you that you can't come in. Womp womp.
