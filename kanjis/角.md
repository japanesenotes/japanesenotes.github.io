## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> task</span> in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> prison</span> is to bend things into different <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> angle</span>s and then put them in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> corner</span>. No one will tell you why you're doing this, but you get a couple cents an hour to do it, so you aren't going to complain.
* Picture yourself sitting in a corner, bending pieces of metal and scrap to fit the angle of that corner.
* To get the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> angle</span> right you find that you have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かく](https://jisho.org/search/かく)</span>) your head to the side a lot. After cocking your head at weird angles so much you also start to hear cocks crowing in your head. Cock-co-cock-co-caww!
* Imagine cocking your head to different angles and hearing cocks crow every time you do. Prison isn't as fun as you thought it would be. Manual labor and loud chickens aren't what you expected.
