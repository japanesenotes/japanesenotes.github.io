## Mnemonics
 * The radical <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> death</span> and the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> death</span> are the same.
* This thing is deceased. It ain't alive anymore.
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> death</span> will be because of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bow</span>ling (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼう](https://jisho.org/search/ぼう)</span>) accident. Oh, you didn't know? You're going to be hit by a giant bowling ball and crushed flat.
* You didn't want to know what would cause your death, you say? Well that's a shame. I guess you could try to avoid bowling from now on, but that won't do any good. Mark my words, your death will be bowling-related.
