 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Someone</span> decided to build a bunch of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span>s and turn them into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> metropolis</span>. You don't know who they are, but now an absolute ton of other someones you don't know also live here in these buildings and work in this busy metropolis.
* Imagine just how many different someones live in this metropolis. There are so many people, you'll never meet them all!
* You try to picture the faces of all the people who live in this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> metropolis</span>, but for some reason you can only picture their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> toe</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [と](https://jisho.org/search/と)</span>). And there are ten times as many toes in this city than someones.
* If you think about it, every metropolis is completely jam-packed-full of toes. Just picture it. Toes. Everywhere. In every building. Filling up the streets.
