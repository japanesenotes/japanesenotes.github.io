What are you gonna do with all these body parts in prison? You should exchange them for cigarettes and toilet alcohol.
* You just have so many fingers, mouths, and legs you've pummeled off of the other prisoners. Exchange them for better loot!

You read a book or watched a show about him once and you're pretty positive that Genghis Khan would exchange the body parts of his enemies all over the continents of Asia and Europe for nicer stuff.
* Think back to when you were a kid and they would roll out those TVs on stands into the classrooms. Imagine watching a documentary on Genghis Khan's exchange routes where he bought and sold body parts. Educational!
