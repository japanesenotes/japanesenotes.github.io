* Imagine what it would be like to squeeze your fingers into a keyhole. Maybe try squeezing one finger really tight first. Did that hurt? Well it's going to be a lot worse in that key hole.
* Once you've <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> squeeze</span>d your finger in the key hole to unlock this door you squeeze all the money and jewels and treasures you can fit into your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sack</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さく](https://jisho.org/search/さく)</span>). Your stealing sack.
