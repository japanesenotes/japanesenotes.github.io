## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> grants a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gladiator</span> its <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> power</span> so he will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> win</span>!
* Watch as the moon's power fills the gladiator. He starts to glow, grows larger, and has some craters on his face now. Well.. okay.
* He <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> win</span>s over and over again, and soon the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>) is even rooting for him. In fact, the Shougun claims him as his personal gladiator of choice.
* The Shougun is only interested in people who win. But you probably could have guessed that already.
