## Mnemonics
 * On the bottom of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bamboo</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> root</span>s there is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stamp</span> that tells the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> season</span> in which it was cut. We've been putting these season stamps on bamboo, and later pretty much every perishable food, for a long, long time.
* Picture yourself in a grocery store. You see a big pile of bamboo and pick each one up, checking the season stamps on their roots, to make sure you don't buy an old one.
* These <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> season</span> stamps are marked on bamboo <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sets</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せつ](https://jisho.org/search/せつ)</span>). You can't buy a single banana or a single grape, and just like that, if you want some nice seasonal bamboo, you have to buy them in sets.
* How many bamboo sets will you be buying this season? I'm getting 42 sets.
