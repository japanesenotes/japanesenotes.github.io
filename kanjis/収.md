## Mnemonics
 * Wrap <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> vines</span> around a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> obtain</span> it. Don't worry about paying for it, sneak into the stool store and tie some vines around the legs. Then when you leave, pull the vines and the stool will come out after. That's how you obtain a stool!
* You can obtain a lot of goods this way without needing any cash. Just don't tell anyone I told you.
* Today you want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> obtain</span> a new pair of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shoe</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅう](https://jisho.org/search/しゅう)</span>). You tie your vines around the stool they're on, and slowly inch them toward the door.
* You have to pull very slowly, or the shoes will fall off the stool. But you really, really want to obtain these particular shoes (they're really sweet), so you keep scooting them toward you.
