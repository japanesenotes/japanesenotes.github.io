## Mnemonics
 * Use <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> simultaneous</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> jackhammer</span>s to perform the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> purification</span> ritual. Two jackhammers running perfectly in sync will purify your body, mind, and soul! (And the ground around you that's being jackhammered.)
* Close your eyes and feel the purification begin. Try not to let the loud jackhammering sound bother you, just focus on the simultaneous vibrations cleansing you inside and out.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> purification</span> ritual is supposed to help you forget your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cy</span>borg (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さい](https://jisho.org/search/さい)</span>). It's been a while, but you can't seem to get it our of your head. 
* Hopefully this purification (or just the two jackhammers shaking your brain up like pudding) will get the memories of your cyborg to go away. You can't keep picturing it all the time like this.
