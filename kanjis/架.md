## Mnemonics
 * With the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> power</span> of your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> you command a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> to become a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shelf</span>. Most of the time one would have to use their hands and tools to turn a tree into a shelf, but you are capable of turning a tree into a shelf by using the power of your mouth.
* Imagine using your mouth to turn a tree into a shelf. Yell at this tree and keep yelling at it until you see it become a shelf.
* Once you turn the tree into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shelf</span> you put the shelf in your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>) and sell it at a local pawn shop. You keep doing this over and over again until you are rich. You command the trees to turn into shelves and then you take the shelves in your car to sell them. Easy money.
* Imagine transporting the shelves in your car. Over and over. Back and forth in your car. Vroom vroom.
