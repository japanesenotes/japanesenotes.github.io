## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> same</span> as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cave</span>. Because, if a wave is big enough, it will curl over on itself, creating a sort of cave within the wave. That's why it's the same as a cave!
* Also, imagine a tsunami hitting a cave, becoming the same as the cave (since a cave will shape it).
* Best way to remember the reading for this kanji is to think about how the shape of a cave is the shape of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dou</span>ghnut (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [どう](https://jisho.org/search/どう)</span>).
* Also note that the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [同](https://jisho.org/search/同)</span> part of this kanji gives away the reading as well. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [同](https://jisho.org/search/同)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [洞](https://jisho.org/search/洞)</span> have the same readings!
