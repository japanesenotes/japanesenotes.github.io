## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> breaks your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bone</span>s, not from hitting you, but from making the ground <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> slippery</span>. The water from the tsunami made all the sidewalks and stairs too slippery to walk on, but you tried anyway, slipped, and broke a couple bones.
* Imagine trying to get back up on the slippery ground. You've already broken a few bones, but you slip again, breaking a few more.
* As you struggle on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> slippery</span> ground you hear a loud yowling sound. You turn and see a bunch of stray <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cats</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かつ](https://jisho.org/search/かつ)</span>) slipping and sliding too. They're coming right for you, uh oh!
* Picture the cats trying to walk on the slippery ground. Their legs keep spreading, so they try to jump, but that makes the slipping worse, and they go sliding forward and topple over their fluffy buns and onto your broken body. Now the cats are all perching on top of you and your broken bones as they try to avoid the slippery ground. It would be nice if they didn't have their claws out.
