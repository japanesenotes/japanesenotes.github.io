## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Not</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Mouth</span> says “<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> no</span>”. What else would you expect from something named the “Not Mouth”? The Not Mouth will always say “no”, regardless of the question.
* Imagine encountering this Not Mouth. Ask it a question. It answers, “No”. Imagine doing this over and over until you believe that the Not Mouth always says “no”.
* You ask the Not Mouth if it is afraid of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> he</span>at (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひ](https://jisho.org/search/ひ)</span>). The Not Mouth says, “<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> no</span>”. So you set the Not Mouth on fire. The Not Mouth then screams, “NONONONONONONONONONOOOOOO~!” Looks like someone can’t handle the heat.
* Listen as the Not Mouth continues to scream in bloodcurdling agony. Hear the flames flicker as they lick across the Not Mouth’s being. Seems as though the heat was too much for the Not Mouth.
