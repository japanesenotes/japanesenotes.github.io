## Mnemonics
 * The radical for <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> foot</span> and the kanji for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foot</span> are exactly the same.<br />That being said, there's also another meaning you should keep in mind, which is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sufficient</span>. If you think about it, one foot should be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sufficient</span> enough to walk around with if you hop.
* Same kanjis and radicals make Jack a happy boy. You should also learn the other meaning as well, though, if you can.
* What do you wear on your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foot</span>? You wear a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そく](https://jisho.org/search/そく)</span>).
* Just think about your bare feet. Think about them too much. Feel how cold it is on your feet. Now, put on a sock to make it feel better. Ahhh, so nice!
