## Mnemonics
 * You're <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> brush</span>ing your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> shaped thing. You're doing the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> action</span> of this brushing over and over hoping to summon Jesus, who will help to solve the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> matter</span> of your cavities.
* Imagine having this strange thing poking you in your gums, tongue, and cheeks. It’s not pleasant. That thing is spiky! What is this thing? How will this action summon Jesus to perform a miracle on your teeth?
* You try the special action out. You brush in a cross pattern, and *poof* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Je</span>sus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span>) appears in your mirror, blessing you and your teeth. Jesus, you're here! you say through your toothpaste filled mouth.
* Imagine Jesus touching your teeth and removing the cavities. What a swell dude.
