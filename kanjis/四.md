## Mnemonics
 * Imagine contorting yourself in such a way that your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> legs</span> end up inside your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span>. You have bent your body in all the wrong ways in order to achieve this. In fact, if you look at yourself, you look like a square now... You're just a person with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> four</span> sides.
* If you can get to square, you should be able to get to four as well, since squares always have four sides.
* This amazing feat, which turned you into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> four</span> sided square, has you looking like a four sided animal: the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>). Look at yourself in the mirror and see an adorable four-sided sheep looking back at you. (You can't see the other sides because mirrors aren't 3D and whatnot. So you're a bit cartoonish.)
* What's better than one four sided sheep?
