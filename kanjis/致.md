## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mole</span> in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> do</span> whatever you ask, if you know how to ask it.
* They do most of their own chores during the rest of the year, so winter is when you should ask them to do things for you.

* Moles will do anything for cheese, but honestly, wouldn't we all?
