## Mnemonics
 * As a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hat</span>, <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> four people</span> holding a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> use an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> umbrella</span>. The umbrella is big enough to be a hat for all four people, so it makes sense. All four of them are religious missionaries, so that’s why they’re holding the cross.
* See these four people all under one umbrella. No one is carrying the umbrella, it’s just resting on all of their heads like a hat. Their hands are busy holding that cross, anyway.
* You know the Spanish phrase “Mi <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> casa</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かさ](https://jisho.org/search/かさ)</span>) es su casa”? Well this is kind of like that, but only with a hat. And that hat is an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> umbrella</span>. Mi casa es yours too, because it’s an umbrella and also a hat. This makes sense, trust me.
* Imagine the four people in the umbrella hat again, only this time imagine them skipping along singing “Mi casa es su casa”. It’ll help you remember.
