## Mnemonics
 * You have the measurement of a leader. Imagine yourself measuring said leader (his/her height) and then coming up short. This is not good, you think. Leaders need to be at least six feet tall. So, to make the leader tall enough, you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attach</span> another head to the top of his/her head.
* Make sure you really feel like the person can’t be a leader because they’re too short when you measure them (I know this isn’t true, but we’re remembering kanji here, anything goes!). As long as you feel disconcerted that the leader isn’t tall enough, you should be able to remember that you need to attach something to the leader to make him/her tall enough. The fact that you’re attaching another head to the top of his/her head is pretty weird too, and should help you to remember the meaning.
* You have to remember the kun'yomi reading of this kanji, and the part you need to remember is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>. So, think of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attach</span>ing something to something else. What would you need? You'd need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>) things to put together!
* Just focus on how attaching requires two things to remember this reading.
