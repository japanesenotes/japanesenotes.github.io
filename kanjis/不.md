## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> not</span> and the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> not</span> are the same thing! That makes it easy... Not!
* Actually, it does make it easy - the radicals make kanji wayyy easier, no?
* To remember <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span> we'll use the word fool.<br />Think of those jokes, where someone says something, then ends with a loud <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> NOTTTT</span>! Someone is doing that to you, over and over. What is that person? That person is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foo</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>).
* Be sure to feel irritated at that person. Think in your head as they're telling these dumb not jokes how much of a fool they are... and how much of a fool you are for sitting here and listening to them.
