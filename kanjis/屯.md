## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> barracks</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> barracks</span> kanji are the same!
* Know your radicals, yo!
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Barracks</span> are pretty big, so they weigh a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ton</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とん](https://jisho.org/search/とん)</span>). And they probably take tons of materials to build.
* Imagine trying to lift some barracks. They weigh a ton! How are you supposed to do this? Why would you even try to lift something that obviously weighs a couple tons?!
