## Mnemonics
 * Under your own <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span>, a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> geoduck</span> jumps out of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sword</span> and stabs your husband/wife/marriage partner to death. Now you're a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> widow</span>.
* Imagine the geoduck laughing and screaming, Now you're a widow! Now you're a widow! flailing the sword around. It's awful.
* You may be a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> widow</span>, but that doesn't make you weak. You run outside, jump into your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>), and run your entire house and the geoduck over.
* It's just you and your car now, living the widow life, driving on into the sunset and forgetting your past.
