## Mnemonics
 * Putting on <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cleats</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span> of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> and braving the harsh elements just to plant a kiss on your sweetheart’s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> forehead</span> – that’s <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> love</span>. Sure, you could see them another day, but you need to plant this smooch on their forehead today, so you get some cleats for better grip on the winter snow and you keep thoughts of your dear in your heart as you travel to see your love.
* Feel the joy of love in your heart as you travel out in the winter. It’s cold outside, but the feeling of love in your heart keeps you warm. Feel this warm love emanating and heating your body.
* Walking through the winter snows with your cleats on, you’ve gotta keep your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eye</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あい](https://jisho.org/search/あい)</span>) on the prize. It’s a really hard journey, but you keep your eye on the prize, which is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> love</span> and the time you’ll get to spend with them.
* Imagine seeing your love with your own two eyes after a long time away from them. It feels great to be reunited and see eye to eye once again. Imagine this feeling.
