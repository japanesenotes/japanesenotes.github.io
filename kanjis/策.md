## Mnemonics
 * With a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bamboo</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> resting atop your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> head</span>, you devise a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> plan</span>. The plan is actually for getting the bamboo tree off of your head. You’re trapped under it.
* Imagine being trapped under this bamboo tree that is resting on your head. You’re stuck. Feel the weight of the bamboo tree pressing on your head as you try and devise a plan to get out from under it.
* But why is this bamboo tree so heavy? You look to each end of the bamboo and realize that there is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sack</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さく](https://jisho.org/search/さく)</span>) tied on each end. Each sack seems to be filled with heavy rocks. Looks like someone made a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> plan</span> to trap you here. Now you have to devise a plan to escape!
* Bamboo is usually kind of light, but this bamboo has a sack of rocks tied to each end making it heavy. Imagine yourself trying to remove this bamboo tree by pushing it up and away from you. It’s like doing a bench-press, bamboo style.
