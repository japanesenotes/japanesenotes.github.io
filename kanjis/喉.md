## Mnemonics
 * Into your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> shot an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> arrow</span> with an attached <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hook</span> so that they'd be able to see into your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> throat</span>.
* Imagine the arrow with its hook shooting down into your mouth and hooking into your throat. Ouch! Now the leader is peering down in there, but you don't know why.
* From your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> throat</span> you hear a voice. Not yours, but one you recognize. It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>! What's that rascal doing down in your throat?
* The leader starts to tug <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> out of your throat, but he resists. No, I like it down here, it's dark and damp. The leader gets angry and pulls harder, which hurts! This is your throat, after all, don't you get a say?!
