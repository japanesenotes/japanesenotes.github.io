* The cloned <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span>s were causing all the crime in these parts (or so Emperor <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> said), so by throwing them in a prison built right there just for them, this area could once again achieve equilibrium.
