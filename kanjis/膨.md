## Mnemonics
 * Play your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drum</span> under the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> and your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hair</span> will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> swell</span>! The more you play and the longer it's under the moon, the larger your hair will swell.
* Have you been suffering from flat, boring hair? Well do I have the swelling treatment you've been looking for!
* Using this method, your hair <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> swell</span>s so much it looks like a giant <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bow</span>ling (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼう](https://jisho.org/search/ぼう)</span>) ball is sitting on top of your head. It's all round, and well... swollen is probably the only word that fits.
* Imagine watching your hair swell to the size of a large bowling ball. Imagine never being able to go bowling again because the comparison is too easy for people to make.
