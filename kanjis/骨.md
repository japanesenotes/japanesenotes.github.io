## Mnemonics
 * If you have a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mustache</span> and you hit your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> forehead</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span>, you’re probably going to break a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bone</span>. Ok, so it doesn’t matter so much if you have a mustache, but if you’re travelling fast enough to make it to the moon, you’re definitely breaking a bone if you run into it.
* Imagine the force and mass of the moon hitting you right in the boney part of your forehead. Whomp! It sure would hurt.
* Outer space is cold, and if you're traveling to the moon, you're going to need a lot of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coats</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こつ](https://jisho.org/search/こつ)</span>). All of these coats will keep you warm, even if you do end up breaking your forehead <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bone</span>. 
* Again, feel your bones crack as you smash into the moon. At least you're warm though. Feel the cozy coats you're wearing and snuggle up in their warmth.
