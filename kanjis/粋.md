## Mnemonics
 * There’s some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice</span> in the shape of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> nine</span> on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> and this is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stylish</span>. The rice grains are arranged to form the number nine. This number nine is prominently displayed on the cross, and it’s stylish to carry it around and be seen with it.
* Imagine hefting this cross with the rice in the shape of a nine on it. You don’t feel stylish, but society tells you that you are. You’re stylish.
* It’s also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stylish</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> swi</span>ng (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すい](https://jisho.org/search/すい)</span>) the cross around while you wait for things. You’re waiting at a bus stop so you swing the cross around violently. You swing it so violently that the rice comes flying off!
* See the rice fly through the air from you swinging the cross. Hear it as it clatters to the ground. This cross just isn’t as stylish anymore now.
