## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span>, Master <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Splinter</span> (the rat from Ninja Turtles) isn't even supposed to exist. He exists because someone <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accidentally</span> poured ooze on him.
* Imagine someone accidentally spilling ooze on a rat, then watch the rat turn into a sentient rat martial artist.
* But really, if you do something <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accidentally</span>, it's probably a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> goo</span>d (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぐう](https://jisho.org/search/ぐう)</span>) thing in a way. You learn a bit about how you can improve yourself so you don't do it again, or in Splinter's case, it's just a good mistake!
* However you look at it, try to make this accident be a good accident.
