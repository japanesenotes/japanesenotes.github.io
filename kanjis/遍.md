## Mnemonics
 * Riding a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> library</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> universal</span> experience. People young and old have all, at some point, taken a scooter to the library, picked up a book, used the internet, sat in the comfy chairs, then left via that same scooter.
* Scooters and libraries are universally loved by all! 
* Riding a scooter to the library is so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> universal</span>, even <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hen</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [へん](https://jisho.org/search/へん)</span>) do it. 
* The next time you scoot to the library look around. There are little hen scooters and hens there with their chicks. They're reading them books about grains and how to hatch eggs. It's a universally adorable thing to see.
