## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Viking</span> in a position of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> power</span> does not need to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> labor</span> in the fields. Labor is for the weak! A Viking of power takes what he wants, and need not labor for it. A powerful Viking plunders all and takes what he wants!
* Imagine yourself as a powerful Viking. You have the power to take anything you want, pillaging and plundering to your heart’s content. Imagine all the things you would acquire with this sort of power.
* It takes a lot of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> labor</span> to harvest <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> roe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ろう](https://jisho.org/search/ろう)</span>) so that’s what the Viking decides to take first! Roe is delicious, but it’s small and delicate. Vikings don’t labor for their own roe! They take it and eat it!
* Picture this powerful Viking laying siege on a small fishing village and taking all the roe and stuffing it into his bearded face. So much labor went into harvesting that roe! Vikings are so mean!
