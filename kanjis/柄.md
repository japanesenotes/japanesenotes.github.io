## Mnemonics
 * You walk up to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> and put <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dynamite</span> on it. Then you set it off. BOOM. It explodes, but doesn't do what you'd expect. Instead of blowing the tree up, it blasts a very beautiful <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pattern</span> into the side of it as well as the ground around it.
* Think about what pattern it might be. Is it a checkered pattern? Something more complicated and beautiful? Whatever it is, think of something that really impresses you.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pattern</span> is so beautiful that you want to put it on your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gara</span>ge (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がら](https://jisho.org/search/がら)</span>). So, you do.
* Imagine painting your garage with the pattern you imagined earlier.
