## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> woman</span> is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rejoic</span>ing. She must be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> glad</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> happy</span> to rejoice out loud in front of you like this.
* Picture a woman rejoicing loudly. She's got a big smile on her face and she wants you and everyone else to see how glad she is.
* I'm so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> glad</span>! the woman shouts, Because I found the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>)! You immediately start to wonder what the key is. The key to life? The key to learning Japanese? Then you see she's holding up some car keys.
* You'd be happy too if you'd just found your lost keys. Though maybe you wouldn't shout it for the entire world to hear.
