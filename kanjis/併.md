## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span> takes a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lantern</span> and searches for people to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> join</span> him. He needs more people to join his cause so he can get his horns removed. He’s embarrassed of them which is why he only travels at night, hence the lantern.
* Imagine this shady leader approaching you in the night. The lantern light shines in your face. Would you join him?
* The leader guy approaches you out of the darkness, his lantern held high. Oh no, not that guy. You've heard about his horn problem and you don't want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> join</span> him. You look around and spot a large <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hay</span>stack (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [へい](https://jisho.org/search/へい)</span>). You quickly jump into it and hide from him.
* The last thing you wanted to do was join that guy so you hid in a haystack to avoid him.
