## Mnemonics
 * The kanji and the radical that look like this are exactly the same. They are both <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cottage</span>.
* As long as you know the radical cottage, you know the kanji cottage.
* You got this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cottage</span> from a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sha</span>man (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゃ](https://jisho.org/search/しゃ)</span>). In fact, everyone you know got their cottage from a shaman. One day you're just walking in the woods, and the next thing you know, a shaman is giving you the keys to their old cottage.
* I guess shamans are moving out a lot around here. Why don't you go look for a cottage you can buy from a shaman! I bet you'll get a pretty good, totally not cursed, deal!
