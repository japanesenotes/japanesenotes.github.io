## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> carries your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> yurt</span> and you on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span> under it away. You are now in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> transit</span>.
* Imagine being carried away on your stool by the tsunami, with your entire yurt floating around you too. You're both in transit... to somewhere. You don't know where though.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> transit</span> of yourself and your yurt home is due to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> water</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わた](https://jisho.org/search/わた)</span>). This is water transit.
* You hope the tsunami's water will drop you off somewhere nice. Somewhere it's easy to jump on a different kind of mass transit, to get back home again.
