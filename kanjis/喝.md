## Mnemonics
 * If you put your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spoon</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> while you're in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> prison</span>, a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> will appear to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scold</span> you. You can never see who the mouth belongs to, but considering you're in prison it's probably a guard. Either way, that person doesn't like what you're doing and they keep scolding you when you put your spoon out into the sun.
* Imagine trying to reflect some precious sunlight into your prison room with a spoon. Now imagine a mouth appearing in the way of the sunlight and it scolds you.
* One day you finally get fed up. You need to know who the mouth of the person who's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scold</span>ing you is. You stick your spoon out into the sun and the mouth appears, scolding you right on time. You reach out and grab them. But in your hand is a pile of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cats</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かつ](https://jisho.org/search/かつ)</span>).
* WHAT KIND OF WORLD IS THIS THAT YOU'RE IN A PRISON WHERE CATS SCOLD YOU?!
