## Mnemonics
 * You have a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> surplus</span> of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ladle</span>s laid out <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> diagonally</span> in front of you. Why are they diagonal? And why do you have so many ladles? Why the surplus? Hang on, we'll get there.
* Look at all these ladles lying diagonally in front of you. Pick them up. Feel the wood grain. Wonder why you have so many.
* In front of this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> diagonal</span> pattern is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sha</span>man (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゃ](https://jisho.org/search/しゃ)</span>) who is currently staring at you. You slowly reach down and turn one of the ladles around, diagonally, and look back up. The shaman's eyes are wide, and now they're scribbling on in a notebook.
* Uh oh, is this one of those weird tests where they find out if you're the chosen one or some old scholar reincarnated? Who know laying ladles at diagonal angles could reveal this kinda stuff?!
