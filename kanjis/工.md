## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> construction</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> construction</span> kanji are the same!<br />This kanji also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> industry</span>, which is what construction is, if you think about it. It's all part of the construction industry.
* Know your radicals and you'll know this kanji's meaning.
* For kanji that use the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)</span> (there are a lot of them!) we will use the character <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち</span> every time. He's one of the people who started this website, so we'll do our best in the mnemonics to embarrass him as much as possible. Anyways, remember that whenever you see <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)</span>, think <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち</span>.<br />You see some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> construction</span> in front of you. There, standing shirtless (only a suspender and hard hat) is (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>), looking back at you.
* If <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち</span> as a construction worker standing in a construction site some how doesn't make your legs tremble, that's okay and totally normal. Do make sure you take this story to a ridiculous enough level to hook a memory into that brain of yours. Be mad at him for not following construction site regulations (where's his shirt, shoes, and pants!?). Why is he using that bulldozer like that?<br />Alternatively, say you really do like what you see (you're going to have to imagine a much better looking version of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち</span>'s actual face, though). You and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち</span> make eye contact a little too long. He nods, puts his cigarette out, and takes off his hard hat, letting his long Fabio-esque locks flow. You beckon him over and he comes. What happens next is up to you and your own imagination. My guess is you have a very deep conversation about kanji and the best ways to learn it.<br />Hint: When you see <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [工](https://jisho.org/search/工)</span> in a kanji it will often take the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)</span> reading. Remember that, because it comes up quite a bit!
