## Mnemonics
 * Pointing a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> east</span>, you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> practice</span> your navigation skills. You’ve discovered a method to tell direction using just a thread, so you point it to the east in order to find your way. The method takes practice though, so you’re sure to practice every day.
* East is the land of the rising sun, so imagine yourself practicing this method, pointing the thread to the east as the sun rises up. Feel the heat of the sun’s rays and see the bright light as the sun shines up over the horizon.
* Also, you are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ren</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れん](https://jisho.org/search/れん)</span>), from Ren &amp; Stimpy the TV show. Since you’re not in the TV business anymore, you’ve decided to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> practice</span> your other skills. How mature of you, Ren.
* If you’ve ever seen the show Ren &amp; Stimpy, imagine what it would be like to be Ren. If not, watch a clip on YouTube and pretend you are Ren when you practice doing things, like studying kanji.
