## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> woman</span> sees herself (<span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> oneself</span>) as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> princess</span> or a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> queen</span>. As women should! 
* Just remember, when you're around other women (and woman-aligned peoples), it's important to treat each other like princess and queens, not just oneself.
* All of us <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> princess</span>es and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> queen</span>s share a special <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hea</span>t (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひ](https://jisho.org/search/ひ)</span>). When we see another princess or queen that heat passes through us and we nod to one another.
* All princess and queens can feel the heat coming off of the others.
