## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span> made from a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> womb</span> must be placed upon the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> land</span>.
* Why must it be placed upon the land? If it were put in water, it would dissolve too quickly. So, you put your womb building on the land, instead.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> land</span> around your womb building will, unfortunately, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reek</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りく](https://jisho.org/search/りく)</span>) though.
* It's made of biological materials, so of course it will reek.
