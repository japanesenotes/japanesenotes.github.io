 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fortune</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fortune</span> kanji are exactly the same! But it also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> occupy</span> as well, so don’t forget that. Fortune and occupy both occupy the same radical.
* Just remember that this kanji also means occupy and you’ll be just fine.
* To <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> occupy</span> some free time you have, you go and get your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fortune</span> told at a fortune teller. Your fortune is that you’ll have an encounter with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cen</span>taur (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span>) in the near future. Just then you realize that the fortune teller is actually a centaur! The fortune has come true!
* Imagine getting your fortune told by a centaur fortune teller. Do you trust this mythical beast to know your future? Watch him manipulate his crystal ball as his hooves stomp the ground beneath him.
