## Mnemonics
 * You're looking for a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> treasure</span>, but no normal treasure... a treasure that's a stash of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> energy</span>. Not gold, money, or anything like that. Imagine yourself finding it, and opening up a treasure chest. Out bursts a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spirit</span> ball of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> energy</span> like you've never seen.
* Try to touch the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> energy</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spirit</span>, it's pretty amazing. Is it solid? Does it shock you? What does it feel like? Be sure to imagine it out.
* As you reach inside the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> energy</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spirit</span>, you feel something hard inside. It's a large <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>) that gives you access to another treasure.
* You take the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> and open another treasure that's nearby. Open it up and see what's inside. Imagine something spectacular.
