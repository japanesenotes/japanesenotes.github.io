## Mnemonics
 * The only <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> will live in is an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> oak</span> tree. They really only do this because oak trees have really yummy acorns and turkeys loooove acorns.
* Imagine seeing a turkey sitting in an oak tree munching on acorns. You didn't even know turkeys could fly, but it got up there somehow.
* If you see a bunch of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> oak</span>s but no turkeys just yell, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> SOOEY</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つい](https://jisho.org/search/つい)</span>)! and they'll all come jumping out! Just because you can't see a turkey in there doesn't mean there isn't one!
* Imagine standing in a grove of oak trees and yelling SOOEY! SOOOOOEY! Now watch as hundreds of turkeys come flying at your face! They think you have more acorns for them. RUN!
