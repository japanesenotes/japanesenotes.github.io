## Mnemonics
 * You have a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> net</span> of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> for catching a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span>. But, it must be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spread out</span> and you must <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> arrange</span> it first.
* The reason you'd use a net made of thread is because it's hard to see. But, it's only that way when you spread out the net. It's important to spread out and arrange your net otherwise the turkey will see it.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spread out</span> your net and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> arrange</span> it just so. You expect it to catch a turkey, but instead you catch the ancient Egyptian god <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ra</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ら](https://jisho.org/search/ら)</span>).
* Let me out of this net! says Ra. You arranged and spread it out just right so I couldn't see it!
