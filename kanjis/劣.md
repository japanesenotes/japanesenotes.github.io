## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> few</span> members of society without <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> power</span> suffer from severe <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inferiority</span> complexes. Most people in this world have lots of power, so the few that do not feel quite inferior. It is this feeling of inferiority that fuels their inferiority complexes.
* Imagine you are one of the few without power. Feel the inferiority crushing down on you. It feels terrible and there is nothing you can do about it.
* Since you suffer from such extreme feelings of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inferiority</span>, when someone offers you and your friends the chance to gain power, you yell “<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Let’s</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れつ](https://jisho.org/search/れつ)</span>) go!” without a second thought. “Let’s go, guys! Come on! Power awaits us!”
* Let’s go, let’s go! Time’s a wastin’! I’m tired of this inferiority and want to gain some power!
