## Mnemonics
 * You see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span> stuck in the ground with a little bit of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fur</span> coming out from it and on closer inspection you realize it’s actually a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tail</span>. Someone stuck a flag into some sort of animal, pushing it under the ground. All that’s visible now is some fur and part of the tail.
* What kind of animal could it be? You start to feel the soft fur with your hand and then the stench of death hits your nostrils. Ew.
* You try to pull the flag out of the ground and hear a rumbling buzzing sound. At the end of the flagpole you see a huge <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bee</span>hive (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [び](https://jisho.org/search/び)</span>)! These bees made their home under the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tail</span>! Maybe that’s why the flag was sticking in it… to warn people. Oops.
* See the bees swarming out from around the tail and toward your face. Run! Run before there’s nothing left of you but your own tail!
