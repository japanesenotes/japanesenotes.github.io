## Mnemonics
 * Two <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> pool</span>s, both altered and not quite like a pool you’ve seen before are put together and flipped around – this is an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> egg</span>. One pool is the egg white, the other pool is the egg yolk. They’re different, but similar.
* Separate the two pools from one another. Now the pools look like the kanji. The kanji is one white pool and one yellow pool. Neat, huh?
* You remember <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Tamago</span>tchi (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たまご](https://jisho.org/search/たまご)</span>), right? Well, Tamagotchi is an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> egg</span>, and the toy looks like an egg, so it’s pretty easy to remember that tamago means egg.
* Just think Tamagotchi whenever you see this kanji. Tamagotchi = tamago = egg. Easy!
