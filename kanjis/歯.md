 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Stop</span>! That <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> box</span> of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice</span> is actually full of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> teeth</span>! I know it says rice on the cover, but I promise you those are all teeth and if you bite into them you'll break a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tooth</span> of your own.
* Stop what you're doing and look into the rice box. Nope, it's definitely full of teeth. There's a grain or two of rice, but it's like 98% teeth.
* Why do I have a rice box full of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> teeth</span>? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ha</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span>)! Would you like to know. Ha! I definitely have an answer that isn't weird or creepy. Ha... ha ha...
