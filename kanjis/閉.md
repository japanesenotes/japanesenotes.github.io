## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gate</span> to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> genius</span> is now <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> closed</span>. The genius’ visiting hours are over, so the gate is closed. This genius has been genetically modified to know more than any human could know, and his days are spent answering questions and advising. But now, his work day is over, so his gates are closed.
* See the genius sitting behind the gate as it creaks closed in front of you. Hear the gate slam closed as you keep in mind that this genius has been modified to have increased intelligence because the genius radical in this kanji is modified as well.
* On the other side of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> closed</span> gates there is still a line of people that want the genius's advice. They decide to keep waiting until morning and gather together some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hay</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [へい](https://jisho.org/search/へい)</span>) so that sleeping outside won't be so awful.
* Picture a bunch of people in front of closed gates, sleeping in piles of hay. Super itchy hay.
