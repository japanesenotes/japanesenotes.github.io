## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> machine</span> in your body that is powered by the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> is your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> womb</span>, also called your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> uterus</span>! Haven't you ever wondered why periods happen with the revolutions of the moon? That's because it powers your uterus and tells it what to do!
* The next time you're cursing your uterus for making you bleed, curse the moon instead! It's the moon's fault you're in pain.
* It kind of sucks, but there is no way to sever this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> uterus</span> - moon <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tie</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たい](https://jisho.org/search/たい)</span>). But if you find a way please tell me, I can't take this anymore.
* Picture an invisible tie tieing your uterus to the moon. Damn you moon, stop pulling, it hurts!
