## Mnemonics
 * You have some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> next to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> pool</span> that has an extra <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> of water in it because you need them to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> equal</span>. If there's too much dirt outside the pool and not enough water inside, it's gonna look weird. We can't have that.
* Imagine seeing a pool that isn't equal. It's like a tiny kiddy pool with an inch of water. And it's surrounded by mounds of dirt. No no no, this won't do—add more water to make them equal.
* You spend a few hours making sure the water-to-dirt ratio is perfectly <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> equal</span>, not for yourself, but because the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kin</span>g (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きん](https://jisho.org/search/きん)</span>) of England told you to. You may agree that equality is important, but it's the King's responsibility to keep things that way. Which is why he ordered you, small peon, to do the equalizing work for him.
* Okay, so the existence of a king kind of makes things not, well, equal, for all people. But at least aesthetically everything will be!
