## Mnemonics
 * Take a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mole</span> out of its <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hole</span> and it will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suffocate</span>. They need to be in tight quarters, unlike us humans. So when you take one out of its nice, safe hole, it thinks it can't breathe and suffocates.
* Picture a poor little mole suffocating in your hand after you took it out of its hole. Put it back right away! Don't kill that little mole!
* As the mole <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suffocate</span>s it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cheats</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちつ](https://jisho.org/search/ちつ)</span>) and shoves its head into your closed hand. You realize what it's doing and squeeze your hand tighter so it's more like a hole. You can feel the mole breathing again now.
* Unfortunately, you can't use cheats on life, and the mole suddenly stiffens and suffocates to death anyway. You should feel bad about what you've done.
