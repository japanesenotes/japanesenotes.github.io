## Mnemonics
 * There is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lid</span> covering all the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span>s that are too <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> small</span> to feed themselves, forming the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> capital</span>. All of the small mouths come together and create a place where everyone can support each other.
* Picture the capital of your country. How many mouths have come together to support each other there? A thousand? A million? More?!
* To remember the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょう](https://jisho.org/search/きょう)</span> we use the Japanese city, Kyoto, which is spelled <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> きょうと</span>. It was once the capital of Japan! It was soooo full of mouths that came together that it was the capital for a long, long time.
* When you think of the capital, think of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょう](https://jisho.org/search/きょう)と</span>!
