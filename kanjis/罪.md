## Mnemonics
 * Put a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> net</span> around a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> criminal</span> to show their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> guilt</span>. Criminals look like anyone else on the street, so you decide to tie them in nets to make sure people know who they're dealing with.
* Imagine throwing a net around someone you think, no, you know is guilty of doing something bad to you. It feels pretty nice.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> guilt</span> shows on the criminal's face. They smile, shrug, and pull a stolen <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> xy</span>lophone (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ざい](https://jisho.org/search/ざい)</span>) out of their back pocket.
* Woah! The xylophone is huge, how did they... well whatever, you definitely have proof that they're guilty now and the cops should be here any minute to take your criminal catch.
