## Mnemonics
 * When your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> has a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fault</span>, you need to get an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alternate</span>. Hopefully your insurance will cover it too.
* You have a scooter that you drive every single day, but if you notice a fault, you need to send it in to get it fixed. That's when you break out your alternate scooter.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alternate</span> scooter is made entirely of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 鉄</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てつ](https://jisho.org/search/てつ)</span>). It's hard and cold and not very comfortable when you sit on it. That's why you chose to keep it as an alternate and not as your everyday scooter.
* Imagine riding on your alternate <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [鉄](https://jisho.org/search/鉄)</span> scooter. Feel the hard iron under your bum and the loud sounds it makes as you scoot down the street. I hope your normal scooter is fixed soon.
