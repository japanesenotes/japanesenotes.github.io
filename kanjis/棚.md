## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> with two <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span>s on either side, holding the tree up in a horizontal angle, is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shelf</span>. 
* So, your shelf is made up of a tree and two moons. Imagine this shelf and put things on it. The moons are kind of rolling around, making it hard to build your shelf.
* Your moon shelf is great. It's also huge, because moons are really big. That means you can store a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ton-a</span>-stuff (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たな](https://jisho.org/search/たな)</span>) on it.
* Think about the ton-a-stuff you're going to put on there. Like, literally, measure out a ton of things and put them on there. It can hold it!
