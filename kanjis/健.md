## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> of your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> yoga</span> class uses a special <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> brush</span> to stay <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> healthy</span>. She rubs the brush on her long arms and legs, and she never ever gets sick.
* If you want to be healthy too, just do yoga and rub this healthy brush all over your bod.
* Not everyone wants to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> healthy</span>, but <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ken</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けん](https://jisho.org/search/けん)</span>) the samurai sure does. He needs to be ready at a moment's notice so he can do tasks for other people. He's at every class, rubbing himself down with the brush.
* Imagine Ken, the picture of samurai health, doing yoga and getting that brush all up in those bits.
