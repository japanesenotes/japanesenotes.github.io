## Mnemonics
 * They <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sheep</span> are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> detailed</span> creatures. I mean, I never thought sheep were very detailed, but that’s what they say.
* Imagine getting really close to a sheep and seeing all the tiny detailed curls in their wool. There are hidden patterns you'd never noticed before now!
* The reason these sheep are so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> detailed</span> is that they are trying to impress the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>). If they're fancy enough, perhaps the Shougun won’t kill them for their meat and make their wool into clothing.
* Picture the Shougun, leaning in close to inspect the detailed patterns all over the sheep. His nose is so close, he can probably smell all the little detailed nuances of the sheep's musk too.
