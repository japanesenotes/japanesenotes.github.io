## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horse</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shrimp</span> are sitting next to each other. They are both at the train <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> station</span>, waiting for a train to come and take them home.
* Imagine the horse and the shrimp sitting next to each other on a small bench. There is nobody else at the train station. It is awkward.
* The train pulls into the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> station</span>. They walk up to the train doors, but they don't open. Perhaps <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [えき](https://jisho.org/search/えき)</span>) would help? asks the station master, as he goes over to open the door to the train.
* Instead of saying a key he says eh key. How strange. Imagine the station master saying it like this with his weird accent. You ask him if he has a key and he replies with, What is a key? Then you say eh key. He totally understands you now.
