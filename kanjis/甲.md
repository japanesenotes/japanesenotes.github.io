## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turtle shell</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> turtle shell</span> kanji are exactly the same!
* Cowabunga!
* With a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> turtle shell</span> on his back, imagine <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>.
* Because this is WaniKani, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> has probably set the turtle shell on fire, too. Burn those turtle shells, burn those kanji! he yells.
