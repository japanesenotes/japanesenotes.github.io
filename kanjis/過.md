## Mnemonics
 * While riding on your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span>, you grow a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mustache</span> on top of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mustache</span> you already have in order to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> surpass</span> the people around you. You're in a scooter race and your mustache is the only thing keeping you in the lead, but someone else has a mustache too! So you grow another mustache to surpass them once again!
* Picture yourself running on a scooter with a bunch of other people and closing your eyes tight, willing another mustache to sprout out of your face to surpass them all.
* Suddenly, something else manages to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> surpass</span> you all. It's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>)! A car with two mustaches is also riding on a scooter and going way faster than you.
* Watch helplessly as the car surpasses every single one of your scooter. Both of your mustaches droop in shame.
