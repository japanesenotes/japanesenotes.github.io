 * Inside the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Cow</span>. You need to see it, so you go inside. It is deep down in there, and you'll have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> descend</span> to reach it.
* Focus on descending the stairs. There are many signs that say To Winter Cow: descend with an arrow pointing down. I guess I'll have to descend, you say.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> descend</span> to the bottom and there it is, the Winter Cow. You walk up to the cow, and it swings its head back to see you. Instead of a cow's face, it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>'s face.
* Hello, thank you for descending all the way down here to see me, says the Winter Cow with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span>'s face. You thought you could use the Winter Cow to stop me, but as you can see, I got here first.
