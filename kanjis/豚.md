## Mnemonics
 * On the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span>, it’s easy to turn a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> pig</span> into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pork</span>. The low gravity of the moon makes the whole process much easier and cost efficient. Soon, all the pig farming will be done on the moon and there will never be a pork shortage ever again.
* Imagine going to a pig farm/restaurant on the moon. You’re in a space suit, eating some space pork. It’s delicious. Imagine the best pork you’ve ever had. This is better than that.
* At this particular pig restaurant, they have a secret ingredient that goes onto their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pork</span>. Lots and lots of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> butte</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶた](https://jisho.org/search/ぶた)</span>). Okay, so it’s not that big of a secret. But boy is it delicious. Mmm, butter.
* Butter and pork. A match made in heaven! Imagine yourself scarfing down this buttered pork by the pound. You’re stuffed, but you have to eat more. It’s soooo gooood.
