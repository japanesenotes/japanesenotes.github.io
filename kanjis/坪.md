 * The amount of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> you need to get some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> peace</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two mat area</span>. Two tatami mats, that is. This is a pretty common measurement in Japan, so you should get really familiar with the amount of space that two tatami mats take up together.

That's enough space to bring peace to two living, or dead, bodies!
