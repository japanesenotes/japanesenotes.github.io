## Mnemonics
 * If the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> that's heading for your village is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fat</span> you should try to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> select</span> a different one to hit instead. You don't want to select fat tsunamis because they do more damage.
* Imagine being at the tsunami store and selecting the least fat one there.
* If you're having trouble <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> select</span>ing which one is the least fat just check to see which tsunamis are eating <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ta</span>cos (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [た](https://jisho.org/search/た)</span>). Only fat tsunamis will be eating them, so just look for one without a taco.
* While you select the tsunami that's right for you. Keep an eye out for those fat taco-eating ones. And then stay away from them!
