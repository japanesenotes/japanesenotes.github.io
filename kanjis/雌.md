## Mnemonics
 * If you can <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stop</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> by putting a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spoon</span> in its face you'll know it's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> female</span> turkey. A male turkey will peck the spoon out of your hand and run away. But a female turkey will wonder why you're putting a spoon there, stop, and look up at you wondering if you're okay.
* Picture the female turkey stopping when it sees you holding out a spoon. Why are you doing that human? it thinks. Are you sick?
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> female</span> turkey then runs around making a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mess</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [めす](https://jisho.org/search/めす)</span>) of things trying to figure out what's wrong with you. She kicks around her hay, water bowl, and scratches at your pants, making more mess marks on them. But you don't move and she gets even more worried.
* Imagine watching a female turkey make a mess of her own cage because she thinks you need help. How sweet.
