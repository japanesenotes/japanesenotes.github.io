## Mnemonics
 * Take the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> wrap</span> it in a bag and it will look just like a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cell</span>. It's a circle in a bigger circle. The moon is the nucleus. Yes! Science is happening!
* Picture the moon with a big bag circling it. Now look down at your biology homework on cells. They're identical!
* As you learn about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cell</span>s you realize they're all over your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ho</span>me (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほう](https://jisho.org/search/ほう)</span>). Without ever noticing it, your home has been slowly filling with dead skin cells. And now that you know what they look like (the moon with a plastic wrap bag around it) you can see them everywhere.
* AHHH CLEAN ALL OF THESE CELLS OUT OF YOUR HOME!
