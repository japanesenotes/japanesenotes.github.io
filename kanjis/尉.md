## Mnemonics
 * Who loves their <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span>, using <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> jackhammer</span>s, and precise <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> measurement</span>s? Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> military officer</span>! He's always saluting the flag, jackhammering near all the new recruits to test them, and checking the measurement between the floor and their pants. Who else could it be?
* Picture a military officer doing all those things.
* That <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> military officer</span>'s favorite bird is an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>)! That should be obvious because the eagle is the bird of America! And that's the country he fights for!
* Picture the military officer saluting as an eagle flies overhead. Majestic.
