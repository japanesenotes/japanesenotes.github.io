## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stand</span>ing <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mustache</span> with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> legs</span> is able to sell <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> merchandise</span>. Most mustaches can’t stand because they don’t have legs. This mustache, however, does. It also has a keen business sense, which is why it’s selling merchandise.
* Imagine this mustache entrepreneur, standing at his merchandise stand, selling his wares. He looks quite dignified, legs and all.
* The mustache is selling his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> merchandise</span> so well that even the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>) notices. He leans down really close to the standing mustache man's merchandise and stays very still. Then he snaps his fingers and his servants come rushing out to buy it all!
* Now all of the merchandise belongs to the Shougun. The mustache has nothing left to sell, but at least he's rich!
