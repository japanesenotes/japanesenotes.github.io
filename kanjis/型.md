## Mnemonics
 * There is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lantern</span> on top of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span>. You walk up to take the knife and lantern when you realize it's just a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> model</span>. It all looked real from far away, but now that you're up close you can see none of it is real.
* Why would anyone make a model that looks like a lantern and a knife sticking into the ground?
* You touch the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> model</span> and see that it's made of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>ke (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けい](https://jisho.org/search/けい)</span>)! Someone really into lanterns and knives must have been given this model cake as a birthday present! Though they left it out here so they probably didn't like it.
* Haven't you seen any of those crazy cakes modeled after things like movies, towns, giants hams, and purses? They're all the rage. Next time you make a cake try to make it look like a model lantern and knife with fake cake dirt and everything.
