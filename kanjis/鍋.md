## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gold</span> man has one <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mustache</span> above his lip and one <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mustache</span> below his lip and keeps all his extra mustaches safely tucked away in a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pot</span>. This man is made of gold and has a lot of money. That’s how he can afford to groom two mustaches at the same time. If anything should happen to one, he has plenty of back up mustaches in his mustache storage pot.
* Picture this double mustachioed gold man as he rifles through his pot of mustaches. Imagine how ticklish they must be.
* The mustachioed man’s wife asks if he loves his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pot</span> of mustaches more than he loves her. “<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Nah ba</span>be (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なべ](https://jisho.org/search/なべ)</span>),” he says. “Nah, babe. Nah.”
* Imagine yourself as this golden man with the mustache (and another mustache). Say “Nah, babe” over and over again like you’re trying to convince your wife that you actually love her more than your pot of luxurious mustaches.
