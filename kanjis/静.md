## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Conflict</span> in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> blue</span> water is made <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> quiet</span> by the muffling power of water. Under this blue water is a great conflict between two sea monsters, but on the surface it appears peaceful and quiet as the water prevents sound from rising above the surface.
* Imagine watching this conflict from above the blue water on a boat. You can kind of see the action, but you can't hear a thing.
* As you watch below the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> quiet</span> water, every once in a while a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sa</span>ber (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せい](https://jisho.org/search/せい)</span>) breaches the surface and quietly slices back down.
* Sabers are sharp, curved, and totally quiet. Great for underwater blue conflicts, and sneaky assassinations.
