## Mnemonics
 * Someone climbs onto the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> from the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> when <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dawn</span> comes to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> proclaim</span> that a new day has begun! They proclaim this at the top of their lungs!
* Picture a shadowy shape on top of the roof, proclaiming to the entire town that the new day is here! It's come! And it's also time to get up.
* The thing that climbs up on the roof to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> proclaim</span> that the new day is here is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cen</span>taur (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span>). Ohoho, did you think I was going to say it was a rooster? Wrong! Centaurs are taller than humans and roosters, so when they climb to onto the roof with their horse legs they can see dawn starting before anyone else.
* Picture that shadow on the roof, proclaiming it's a new day, but this time make sure you picture the outline of this centaur. He has a human top half and a horse bottom half. And he's yelling down at you, HEY THE SUN IS UP IT'S DAWN GET OUT OF BED!
