## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> presents you with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> prize</span> as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reparation</span> for his past deeds. This leader wronged you in the past and wishes to make amends. Therefore the leader presents you with a reparation in the form of a glittering prize.
* Imagine receiving your reparation prize. Feel the prize in your hand. It’s all wrapped up but it’s heavy and feels expensive. What could it be?
* The leader who presented you with this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reparation</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>) of Japan. He's trying to make up for all the threats he made to you and some of the things you saw (which he's now trying to cover up for).
* Imagine receiving your reparations from the Shougun himself. You're angry at him for threatening you, wounding people, and cutting off the heads of people who go against him, but you take it anyway.
