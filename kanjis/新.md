## Mnemonics
 * There's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stand</span>ing <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> that you're taking an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> axe</span> to. You're going to cut down this tree to create a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> new</span> chair.
* As you imagine yourself cutting down the standing tree, think about why you need a new chair. Come up with a weird (irritating) reason for why you need a new one so that you can use your emotions a bit to help yourself remember the meaning of this kanji.
* You cut down the tree and make a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> new</span> chair. It immediately explodes, sending splinters into your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shin</span>.
* Only your shin got hit, so focus all your imaginary pain down there. Try to pull out the splinters. Ouch!
