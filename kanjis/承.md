 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> child</span> will ask if they want <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> two</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> water</span>s because they need a grown-up's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> consent</span>. Children aren't allowed to have whatever they want, they need to make sure it's okay and get consent first.
* Picture the child finishing their first water. They look at a big stack of bottled waters, but they know better than to just take two more, they need consent first. Excuse me, sir, could I please have two more waters? the child asks.
* Of course my child, you have my <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> consent</span>, comes the voice of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>). The Shougun is very pleased by this child, because he expects everyone to ask for consent around him.
* You need to make sure to get express consent from the Shougun before you do most things. Especially if it's something like taking more than you've been given.
