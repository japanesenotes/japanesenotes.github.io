## Mnemonics
 * You want to go to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> so you set up a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> twenty</span> stories tall so you can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ascend</span> into the heavens.
* Feel the air whoosh past your face as you shoot off the end of the long slide and ascend into the air. It's starting to get hot and the sun is getting closer!
* You need to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ascend</span> into the sky and toward the sun because the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>) said so. He's testing out some space travel technology (the twenty story slide) and you're his guinea pig.
* As you ascend, look back through tear-filled eyes and see the Shougun staring up at you. He nods slightly. You've pleased him.
