## Mnemonics
 * Under the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> life</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> divide</span>s cells to create life.
* The entire house glows with blobs of life, and the mouth holds the knife in its mouth and cuts the life blobs apart to help them grow.
* As it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> divide</span>s life, the mouth begins to look really familiar. It has big teeth and a crooked mustache... it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Wari</span>o (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わり]([わ](https://jisho.org/search/わ)り)</span>)!<br />Sometimes Wario cuts himself by accident and just becomes <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> わ</span> (which is all he says too).
* Picture Wario's mouth dividing himself now, and creating more, smaller Warios. They all yell WA! and divide up even more until the whole room is full of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わり]([わ](https://jisho.org/search/わ)り)</span>s and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わ](https://jisho.org/search/わ)</span>s!
