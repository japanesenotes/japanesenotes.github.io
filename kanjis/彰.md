## Mnemonics
 * You want to write a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> chapter</span> about <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hair</span> in your new book so you have to make sure it's really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clear</span>. Clear enough so that ANYbody can read it.<br />It's so clear and concise you decide to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> patent</span> it. Now it's yours and yours alone.
* Can you file a patent on a chapter? It's not very clear, but what is clear is how great your writing is.
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clear</span> writing got the attention of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>) and now he's at your door once again, but this time he's angrier than usual. Apparently he was going to steal your clear explanations but since you've patented it, he can't.
* Picture the Shougun angrily holding what is clearly your patent and shouting in your face.
