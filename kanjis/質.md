## Mnemonics
 * You have to use two <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> axe</span>s to open these <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span>. That seems like overkill, but it is necessary. These particular shellfish are of very high <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> quality</span> meaning they won't open so easily.
* Imagine the highest quality shellfish you've ever seen. They're hard, smooth, and basically impenetrable.
* You finally get all of the shellfish open and you're admiring their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> quality</span>, when your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shih tzu</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しつ](https://jisho.org/search/しつ)</span>) jumps up on the table and gobbles them down. NO! You try to chase after the little dog, but it's too late. They're gone.
* I guess your shih tzu knows good quality shellfish too. :(
