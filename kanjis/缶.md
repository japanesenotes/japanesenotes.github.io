## Mnemonics
 * The radical <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> can</span> is the same as the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> can</span>. Usually when we talk about a can with this kanji we mean a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tin can</span>, though.
* Picture a tin can in your mind as clearly as you can.
* The reading for a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> can</span> is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>, which seems impossibly easy. If that isn't close enough for you, picture this:<br />Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>) is drinking out of a tin can. He glug glug glugs, gasps, and wipes his face. He holds out the can, Khan made cans, and winks.
* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span> is can, it's really easy, come on. Just take this one.
