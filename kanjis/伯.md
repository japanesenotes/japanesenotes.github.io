## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> all in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> white</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chief</span>. All the other leaders are wearing some other color, but that's how you tell the chief apart from the other leaders.
* Imagine all the leaders standing around, then the chief person standing there all in white.
* The reading is the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [白](https://jisho.org/search/白)</span>, which is included in this kanji. The other reading is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)</span>, and it's like the honorific <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [御](https://jisho.org/search/御)</span>, in a way. You'd want to be polite to someone who is the chief ______, right? That's why it could be <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)</span>, too.
* You'll learn more about which reading to use when the vocabulary roll around. In the meantime, try to remember both of them the best you can!
