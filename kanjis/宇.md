## Mnemonics
 * You use a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> to keep yourself <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dry</span> and safe from <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> outer space</span>. Look outside, above your roof, and you'll see outer space stretching above you.
* You don't want to float up into out outer space and get all wet, do you? No? Then you better make sure you have a roof above your head.
* Why isn't it dry in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> outer space</span>, you ask? Because of all the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> u</span>ni (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span>) swimming around up there. They have nasty, wet, pointy spikes and they're all over the place.
* Look closely up at outer space and you'll see all of the uni floating around up there. They're really dark, so it can be hard to notice them, but I promise you, they're there.
