## Mnemonics
 * Put a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spirit</span> in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> black hole</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> duplicate</span> comes out. The duplicate looks exactly like the original spirit that went in. How strange.
* Examine the duplicate spirit. Same ghosty body. Same ghosty glow. A perfect copy.
* Suddenly the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> duplicate</span> spirit starts yelling, Why did you throw me into that black hole?! <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> F***</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふく](https://jisho.org/search/ふく)</span>) you!
* You feel pretty bad now. The duplicate spirit seems to have decided to haunt you, and it's muttering F*** you, f*** you, over and over in your ear.
