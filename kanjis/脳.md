## Mnemonics
 * Nestled in the light of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grass</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> treasure chest</span> that you can see with your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> brain</span>. You close your eyes, and you can see the spot, but it's kept deep in your brain, and you have to use its power to find it.
* As you visualize the treasure chest you realize that the moon was your face, the grass your hair, and the treasure chest your brain! It was you all along!
* If you can unlock the secrets of your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> brain</span> you'll have powers like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> No</span>stradamus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [のう](https://jisho.org/search/のう)</span>). Nostradamus was able to look inward at his own hidden brain treasure chest and see the future, so maybe you can be like him too.
* Use your brain like Nostradamus and try to see the future. You see... you see... huh, your brain is just surrounded by kanji.
