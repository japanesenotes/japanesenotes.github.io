 * You take your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> and slam a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lid</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> table</span>. You make this big noise to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> confront</span> the person in front of you. 
* They weren't listening, which is why you slammed that lid down. You'll have to confront them more directly.
* You are trying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> confront</span> Emperor <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>. You're confronting him about all the kanji he's forcing you, and everyone else, to learn. Look here <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span>! I know you said I'd learn like 2000 kanji in no time, but this is way too efficient! What will the people do when they're done? Do you think they will sit idly by?
* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> is laughing at you as you confront him. Which makes you angrier, so you bang the lid on the table some more.
