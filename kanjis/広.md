## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> canopy</span> you use in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> private</span> is very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wide</span>.
* You want your private canopy to be wide so you can sprawl out under it is as much as you want. No one's going to come in and tell you to close your legs or sit up straight. So it can be as wide as you like!
* You like being <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wide</span> because it makes you feel like a different person. But not just any person, like a super <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hero</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひろ](https://jisho.org/search/ひろ)</span>)!
* Picture yourself laying under your wide, private canopy pretending to be a super hero on the ground. You're stretching a nice, wide super hero pose, like you're flying through the sky.
