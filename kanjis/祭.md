## Mnemonics
 * You have a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tent</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> jackhammer</span> in it for the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> festival</span>! Festivals need booths where people can do activities. In this tent, festival goers can use a jackhammer and make a lot of noise, perfect for a festival!
* Imagine being at a festival and waiting in line to ride the jackhammer. You don't want to eat candy apples or ride rides, you want to wait for the jackhammer tent.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> festival</span> is for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cy</span>borgs (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さい](https://jisho.org/search/さい)</span>) only. Picture the cyborg you made getting excited that you're taking it to the festival. That's why all of the activities have to do with heavy machinery. The rides are mostly just cyborgs letting other people ride them, but it's still pretty fun.
* Imagine your cyborg going to this festival. Everyone here has some type of cyborg enhancement, like robotic arms, legs, or braces. Your cyborg is really excited to be around its people and play with jackhammers.
