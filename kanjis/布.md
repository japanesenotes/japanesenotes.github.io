## Mnemonics
 * A matador holding his red<strong>&nbsp;linen</strong>&nbsp;by his side.<br><br>To a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> narwhal</span>, a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> towel</span> is just normal <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cloth</span>. They're always wet so towel cloth is all they know.
* Picture a narwhal wrapped in a fuzzy towel blanket, with a towel tail cover, and some towel underpants. Everything is made of this type of cloth.
* If you use this type of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cloth</span> for your clothes and blankets people will call you a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foo</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>). They think you're a fool who can't tell the difference between human cloth and towel cloth.
* You fool, you aren't a narwhal, that cloth isn't for you! they say. They're so mean.
