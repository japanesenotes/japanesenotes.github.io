## Mnemonics
 * Put <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> of a worm while the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> is out and it will poop out some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> silk</span>. That's why they call them silkworms, didn't you know? But it has to be while the moon is out, otherwise normal thread will come right back out the other end of the worm. The moon is what makes the magic happen.
* Picture feeding some thread into the mouth of a worm as the light from the full moon shines in on you. See the silk come out of the worm's butt and into your hands.
* The biggest fan of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> silk</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ken</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けん](https://jisho.org/search/けん)</span>) the samurai. Everything he wears is silk, even his armor.
* Picture Ken with a silk helmet, silk fundoshi, and a silk sheath for his sword.
