## Mnemonics
 * You have a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bow</span> and you want to make it <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> long</span>. To do that, you'd naturally just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stretch</span> it.
* Imagine holding this bow in your hands, and then stretching it into a longer bow. Feel the strain on your arms as you try to stretch wood. You can feel it stretching, but it's strenuous.
* As you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stretch</span> the bow, you hear someone running at you. That's my bow you're stretching! yells Mrs. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chou</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょう](https://jisho.org/search/ちょう)</span>). She is not happy that you're stretching her things. You should probably try to un-stretch it, put it down, and run before she beats you.
* Now Mrs. Chou is hitting you with the stretched out bow. You cry and apologize, but she won't listen. I'm going to stretch you, like you stretched my bow, she says. Then she does it.
