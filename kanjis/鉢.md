## Mnemonics
 * Cast a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> book</span> in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gold</span> to make a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bowl</span>. Books can be bent into the shape of a bowl, so then all you have to do is pour gold over it to keep it in that shape and ta-da! A bowl has been born!
* Imagine creating this bowl yourself. Try not to burn your fingers with that hot gold.
* The gold <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bowl</span> has a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hatch</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はち](https://jisho.org/search/はち)</span>) attached to it, which used to be the book's back cover. That's fine, you use the hatch as a lid for the bowl!
* Okay, so this may not be the best bowl. You usually don't need a hatch or this much gold coating. But that's how they used to do it in the old days, so that's good enough for you!
