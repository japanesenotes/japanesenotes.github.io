## Mnemonics
 * You want some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> so you take your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cleat</span> to the side of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> hoping they'll fall down, but you get a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> vegetable</span> instead. What? You kick the tree again and another, different vegetable falls out.
* Now you have two vegetables and no flowers. Do vegetables even grow on trees?
* You feed these <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> vegetable</span>s (that you didn't even want) to your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cy</span>borg (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さい](https://jisho.org/search/さい)</span>). It only needs a little though, since its stomach is so thin, so you just make it hold the rest.
* Picture your cyborg nibbling on the vegetables you cleat-kicked out of this tree. You give all of the things you don't like to your cyborg nowadays. Which is probably why there are so many weird things all over it...
