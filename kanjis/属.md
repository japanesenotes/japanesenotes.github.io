 * You see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mantis</span> sitting on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span> and you know for a fact that it does not <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> belong</span> there. Insects should be in trees and on the ground. Not on flags. Insects belong in the wild!
* Look at that mantis, pretending it belongs here. What are you gonna do about it?
* Luckily for you, and unluckily for this mantis who doesn't <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> belong</span> on your flag, you're a Boso<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> zoku</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぞく](https://jisho.org/search/ぞく)</span>) bike gang member, and you don't take crap from nobody. You climb the flagpole, punch the mantis and yell, YOU DON'T BELONG HERE!
* Your Bosozoku life has prepared you for this moment. Those who don't belong, shall be punished, you think to yourself.
