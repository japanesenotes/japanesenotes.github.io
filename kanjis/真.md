## Mnemonics
 * If the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> pope</span> spends all day staring at <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fins</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span>, he’s going to lose touch with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reality</span>. He should be focusing on his popish duties, but instead he’s looking at the fish fins he dropped, and now can’t eat because they’re dirty. Silly pope. You can’t let this one thing get you down. You have other things to do.
* Picture trying to get the pope to stop staring at the fins laying on the dirty ground. His eyes are all big. Yup, he’s completely lost touch with reality, you think.
* You’re doing your best to bring the pope back to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reality</span> when he snaps and kicks you in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shin</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しん](https://jisho.org/search/しん)</span>). Oww! What the heck, pope! But he’s already back staring at the fins and your shin is throbbing where he kicked.
* Imagine the pope angrily kicking your shin super hard. You fall over and pull it close. Feel how badly it aches. Who knew you’d need shin guards to deal with a pope that’s lost touch with reality just from dropping his dinner.
