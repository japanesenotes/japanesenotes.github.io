You are a good leader. You have studied the ground and dirt of the earth your entire life. You know the history of the ground and you know how to use it to lead your people.
* Smell the ground. Waft the earthy smell of history into your leader-like nostrils. What does it smell like? It smells useful. And also like ground.

When you were down there sniffing around you realized that your people will flourish best if you use this land for grazing and raising sheep. 
* When you use the ground for sheep like this, your people rejoice. You're the best leader ever! You always use everything to your advantage!
