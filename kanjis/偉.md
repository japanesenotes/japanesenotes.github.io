## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Korea</span> is destined for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> greatness</span>.
* I mean, they're the leader of Korea already, right? So they have to have a decent chunk of greatness in them already to get that far.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> greatness</span> radiates off of the leader of Korea, so much so that you can hardly look. Just when you're about to close your eyes to shield them from the greatness, a great <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>) soars over them, letting out a cry.
* Picture the greatness of the scene before you: the leader of Korea, a great eagle overhead, it's so great!!
