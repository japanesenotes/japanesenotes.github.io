 * You are given some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gold</span> to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> oversee</span> a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> model</span>. You are a famous architect, so you get a lot of gold for overseeing the construction of models like this one.
* Feel the gold, heavy in your pockets, as you oversee this model being built. Observe it and watch as it grows under your watchful eye.
* As the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> model</span> nears completion, you realize it's taking the shape of Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>). Was that what this was supposed to look like? You were so busy overseeing the gold in your pocket, you forgot!
* You watch nervously as this model of Genghis Khan is finished. You're really not sure if this is who you were meant to model it after, but it's too late to change it now. Genghis Khan it is!
