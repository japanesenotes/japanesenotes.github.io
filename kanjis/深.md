## Mnemonics
 * The force of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> is enough to put a gash in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> about <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> pi</span> (3.14) feet <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deep</span>. Tsunamis are pretty powerful, so the force of the water alone is enough to cut into a tree several feet deep.
* Picture this tsunami wave hitting the tree. It’s like a lumberjack axe of water, cutting deep into the tree with the force of a thousand lumberjacks.
* Some tsunamis cut so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deep</span> that they flat out chop the tree right off its stump. In areas like this, you have to be careful not to bang a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shin</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しん](https://jisho.org/search/しん)</span>) on them. These stumps are right about shin height, so you want to be cautious when walking around them as to not injure yourself.
* Imagine being deep in the woods and banging your shin on a stump you didn’t see. It hurts to bang your shin, so imagine this pain and the awful sensation it brings.
