## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> hits your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> skin</span> and creates smaller <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wave</span>s. Those hit you too!
* If you’ve ever been to the ocean or a large lake, you know what kind of forces even small waves can hit with. Now imagine the force with which a tsunami wave would strike you. You’d have the wind knocked out of you for sure.
* When each <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wave</span> hits your body, you shout, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ha</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span>)! It's not like it's on purpose. When the wave crashes into you, the wind gets knocked right out of your mouth, making a HA sound.
* The waves are basically punching you in the gut, forcing the air out of your lungs, and making you shout HA!
