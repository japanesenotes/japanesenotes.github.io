## Mnemonics
 * If you could <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stop</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spoon</span>ing water onto that <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> we could use it for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> brushwood</span>. But if you don't stop, then it will be too wet to burn at all! Stop already!
* We need to use that brushwood to make a fire! So stop spooning water on it!
* You finally set the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> brushwood</span> on fire and suddenly a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shiba</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しば](https://jisho.org/search/しば)</span>) Inu jumps out of the flames. So that's why they named this wood after them or... or vice versa?
* Shiba inu's come from setting brushwood on fire! That must have been how they got their name!
