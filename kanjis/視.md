## Mnemonics
 * When you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> see</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spirit</span> you have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> look at</span> it. Look at it directly, because if you look away then it could disappear.
* Look at the spirit. Look at its shape and into its eyes. Just don't look away.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> look at</span> the spirit for as long as you can, until you hear a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>) sound. You look away for a second, see the sheep look at you, and when you look back the spirit is gone. Damn!
* Now you have to look at this sheep. Maybe the sheep was projecting the spirit... or maybe it's just a sheep. You'll have to look at it a bit longer to know for sure.
