## Mnemonics
 * In your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> warehouse</span> you use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> create</span>. You keep old pieces of wood in your warehouse, and you use your knife to carve them into new things that only you could create.
* What do you create in your warehouse? Picture all the different things you could create in your mind.
* When you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> create</span> it's good for your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>). It's so freeing, in fact, that when you get really into your creating, sometimes you'd swear your soul was floating a little bit outside of your body. But every time you notice, it sinks back down. Hmm.
* When you create something your soul is happy! It's good for you, you know?
