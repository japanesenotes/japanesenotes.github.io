## Mnemonics
 * There is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> woman</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> child</span> in front of you. You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> like</span> them very much.
* everyong LIKEs woman childs.<br><br><br>Imagine a woman and a child you like very much. Just appreciate them, and think about how much you like those two. The reading mnemonic definitely won't ruin your image of them or anything.
* I <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> like</span> you two, you say to the woman and child. They both turn their heads 180 degrees back towards you. They both have faces that look just like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>'s. We like you too, they say in unison.
* And you DO like them. You have always been a fan of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span>'s kanji learning methods, and you feel so lucky to have married a woman who looks just like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> and then (this is the real miracle!) gave birth to a child that looks like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> too. Hashtag blessed.
