## Mnemonics
 * It may just be a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> over a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bathtub</span>, but this here is actually a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shinto shrine</span>.
* It is indeed just a roof over a bathtub, but I guess spirits inhabit everything according to Shintoism, so there's no reason this bathtub can't be a Shinto shrine too.
* What god does this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shinto shrine</span> hold? You see that It's a-<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> me-ya</span>! (Mario!)
* It makes sense, the person who says It's-a-me! (Mario) is someone who works on bathtubs (and plumbing).
