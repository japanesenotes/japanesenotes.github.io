## Mnemonics
 * In your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> are <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> which really <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> suit</span> you. But you throw them to the people waving to you from below, as you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> board</span> your ship. The flowers fall, unneeded. You're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> embark</span>ing on a new life, a new journey. There will be more flowers where you're going.
* Picture yourself boarding the ship and letting the flowers slip from your fingers, into the crowd of people waving goodbye.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> board</span> a ship to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> とうきょう</span>, bound for your new life, of course!
* Where else would you go at this point? I mean, come on. You've made it 53 levels since you embarked on your kanji journey with us. We know you by now. You want to be in <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span>.
