## Mnemonics
 * There's a close-up of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leaf</span> in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span> inside of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> box</span>. Wait, it's not a box, this whole thing is just a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> drawing</span>.
* Look closely at this box-shaped drawing. See each little stroke, smell the paper and the lead.
* The drawing seems to have something else in the rice paddy, behind the leaf. You realize the drawing is actually of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ga</span>rgoyle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [が](https://jisho.org/search/が)</span>) and a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かく](https://jisho.org/search/かく)</span>). You see the cock sitting on top of the gargoyle, crowing into the sky.
* Picture the entire drawing. There's a cock sitting on a gargoyle, watching over this rice paddy. It's actually quite beautiful and idyllic.
