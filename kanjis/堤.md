## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> correct</span> way to block the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> is with an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> embankment</span>. Build a huge, sloping embankment correctly and the sun won't be able to bother you ever again!
* Imagine an embankment made of dirt, in the correct place, blocking the sun from your eyes.
* Unfortunately, building a correct <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> embankment</span> doesn't just take dirt, but <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ta</span>ter (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てい](https://jisho.org/search/てい)</span>) tots too. You pile up the dirt and the tater tots so the embankment can be nice and high.
* Picture an embankment made of dirt and tater tots. Not like, tater tots just thrown in the embankment, you probably see those all the time. But dirt AND tater tots in the embankment itself.
