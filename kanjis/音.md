## Mnemonics
 * For some reason, you are <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stand</span>ing on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span>. It's obviously very hot, but the thing you notice most is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sound</span> of you burning up.
* Imagine a super loud sizzling sound, drowning everything else out. It's ridiculously loud, and hurts your ears more than the sun's heat hurts your skin.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sound</span> isn't just loud, it's familiar. Finally you place it: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> on</span>ions (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おん](https://jisho.org/search/おん)</span>)!
* Your burning body sounds just like sizzling, crispy onions being fried in a pan. Listen close. It's exactly the same! You can almost smell onions too!
