## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bamboo</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> temple</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> equal</span> to all of the other non-bamboo temples. Just because it's made of bamboo doesn't make it any less special and spiritual.
* Picture this bamboo temple compared to some temples made of stone or wood. It's the same size, shape, and it has the same number of worshipers. It's equal in every way.
* The bamboo temple is also an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> equal</span> distance away from the other temples in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> とうきょう</span>. When you look at a map of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span> temples, you can measure them out and they'll all be perfectly equal.
* While many things in <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span> may not be created equal, the temples are, at least.
