## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> axe</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> axe</span> kanji are exactly the same, with one minor difference. This kanji is also used as the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bread loaf counter</span>, probably because bread was so big and hard in the past that they had to use axes to slice them.
* Imagine you've gone back in time a good hundred years, and you're trying to count loaves of bread after each swing of your axe. Axes and bread loaves will become intertwined in your brain.
* You imagined being back in time too good and now you're stuck using an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> axe</span> to be a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bread loaf counter</span> for the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kin</span>g (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きん](https://jisho.org/search/きん)</span>) of England. You aren't sure which king he is or when in time you are, but he's mean and keeps eating all the bread you cut up with your axe.
* Imagine being stuck using an axe on bread while the King of England glares down at you, munching and spilling crumbs everywhere.
