## Mnemonics
 * If, at a certain <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> angle</span>, you approach an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> insect</span>, you’ll be able to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> touch</span> it without it noticing. Most of the time, insects will run away from you when you try and touch them, but if you do so from the right angle, the insect will have no idea.
* Imagine yourself approaching this insect from a sneaky and stealthy angle. Now touch it. What does it feel like? Smooth? Hard? Fuzzy? Feel the insect in your mind as you touch it.
* Uh oh, looks like this particular insect is a lightning bug so when you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> touch</span> it you get a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょく](https://jisho.org/search/しょく)</span>). Did you know that lightning bugs contain bazillions of volts inside them? Well they do, and if you touch one, you get a shock. A very big shock.
* Feel this electrical shock to your system as you touch the lightning bug. This discourages you from ever touching another insect again. You don’t enjoy the shock.
