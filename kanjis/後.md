## Mnemonics
 * If you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> loiter</span> around to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> poop</span> in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> you never know what could be happening <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> behind</span> you. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> After</span> you're done you could turn <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> back</span> to see something really crazy that you missed because you took so long to poop in the cold.
* Imagine trying to loiter while you poop in the winter. You're just trying to take your time as you squat over the snow, but soon you hear things behind you.
* You finally look <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> behind</span> you and see <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Go</span>dzilla (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ご](https://jisho.org/search/ご)</span>) and a giant <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span> having a violent battle <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> back</span> there!
* Godzilla and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> were going at it behind you the entire time you were just lazily taking a poop in the snow?! Ahh, that's so embarrassing! And also dangerous, they could have crushed you! You should look behind you more.
