## Mnemonics
 * When what you're writing is as <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tall</span> as the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grain</span>s growing outside, you know you're done with your first <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> draft</span>. Some teachers want papers to be a certain number of words or pages, but that's silly. You should measure your draft in grains!
* Imagine holding your draft up outside in a field of grains. You're a couple leaves short. Time to get back to the drawing board.
* Who asked you to write such a tall <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> draft</span> in the first place? Emperor <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>, who wants you to draft up the world's largest book about how great of an emperor he is.
* Now <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> is out there measuring your draft against the tall grain plants. You better hope it's long enough, because if it isn't, Emperor <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span>'s probably going to execute you.
