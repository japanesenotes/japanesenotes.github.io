## Mnemonics
 * Take your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> wrap</span> them around another person. This is called a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hug</span>. Just make sure you include all the stuff attached to your fingers, like your hands and arms too, otherwise it's more of a squeeze, and we don't want to do that to people.
* Picture it like you're a baby who is new to hugs. You start with your fingers, spread them out and move forward. Now wrap all that stuff attached to your fingers around another person. You did it! You're hugging now!
* Who do you love to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hug</span> the most? Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> da</span>d (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だ](https://jisho.org/search/だ)</span>)! He gives the best hugs.
