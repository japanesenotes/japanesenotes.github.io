 * Pour all of your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> alcohol</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> pool</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> serve</span> all your guests at once! They can all help themselves to as much or as little alcohol as they want! What a great idea!
* Imagine serving all of your guests their alcohol by dumping it all in the pool! Now jump in and drink all you want!
* As you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> serve</span> your guests (and yourself) you look over and see <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shaq</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゃく](https://jisho.org/search/しゃく)</span>) also trying to serve them. And by serving I mean getting served because he's throwing them into the pool. 
* Picture Shaq serving your guests by tossing them into your alcohol filled pool. Thanks, Shaq... I guess.
