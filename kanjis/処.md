## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> table</span> would be an odd thing to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deal with</span>. Winter can be hard to deal with on its own, but turn your table into winter? Just dealing with your food getting cold would be the worst!
* Look at this winter table. How are you ever going to deal with it? Just think of your favorite warm food and then imagine it getting cold. Deal with it, dog.
* This winter table is something you have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deal with</span>, sure, but what if you just gave it to a circus <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> show</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょ](https://jisho.org/search/しょ)</span>)? They like weird stuff like this.
* Feel the relief of getting rid of this table. No more having to deal with it anymore. The circus show can have it.
