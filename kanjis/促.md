## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> with one bare <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> foot</span> has the overwhelming <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> urge</span> to put a sock on it. The leader’s foot is really cold, so he really wants to cover it. The urge is overpowering.
* Imagine yourself as this leader with one bare foot. Feel the incredible urge to cover it with something warm and fuzzy.
* Finally you have to give into your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> urge</span>. You put a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そく](https://jisho.org/search/そく)</span>) on your foot. Ahh, that feels so much better. What a great thing, this sock.
* Feel this sock on your foot. It feels great. Wiggle your toes around inside the sock as you think about how glad you are that you gave into that urge of yours. Note that this kanji also has the same reading as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [足](https://jisho.org/search/足)</span>, so keep that in mind too!
