## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> hits a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> and then <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> correct</span>s itself. This causes it to swirl around, creating an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eddy</span>.
* An eddy requires water to change direction and then twirl around, and when the tsunami hits the roof, that's exactly what it does.
* There is a person trying to create an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eddy</span> with a tsunami, and when their roof correction device is shown to be effective, they sing: This is how <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> you do</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よど](https://jisho.org/search/よど)</span>) it.
* Imagine them singing this, emphasizing the you do part of the song as they watch the eddy being formed.
