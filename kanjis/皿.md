## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> plate</span> kanji and the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> plate</span> are exactly the same, like two matching pieces of china.
* If you know your radicals, you know your kanji too.
* The person washing all the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dish</span>es was named <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Sarah</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さら](https://jisho.org/search/さら)</span>). She was named that because of her large head, which was shaped like Sarah Jessica Parker’s head (very big).
* Imagine someone with a huge head, washing dishes. When I say huge, I mean huge. She turns towards you with her big head and says “Hi, I’m Sarah” and you see her name tag, which also says Sarah. She is Sarah, the dish washer. The plates she holds up next to her head pale in comparison, even though they're the biggest pieces.
