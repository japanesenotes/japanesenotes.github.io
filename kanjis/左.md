## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Narwhal</span>s do <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> construction</span> with their left hands (or flippers, I guess). That's because all narwhals are left-handed!
* Picture a bunch of narwhals constructing an underwater ice village. They're all working away with their left hands.
* In their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> left</span> hands, the narwhals all hold <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> saw</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)</span>). That's because the ice for their homes is already there, so they just need to saw away at them to make the shapes they want. Narwhal construction is actually very simple.
* If you're right-handed, imagine trying to use these left-handed saws. It flips and flops all over until you drop it. But if you're left-handed it feels just right!
