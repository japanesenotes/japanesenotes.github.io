## Mnemonics
 * There's <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> treasure</span> in this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> so you take out your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> weapon</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kill</span> it.
* You didn't just cut the tree down, you stabbed it and sliced it and killed it to death.
* After the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kill</span> though, you didn't feel so good, and you had to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sats</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さつ](https://jisho.org/search/さつ)</span>) down. Woah, I mean sat... sats? Uh oh. Something is happening to you. You sats down but your brain is all funny and you can't get up again.
* You sats down after killing the tree because now the tree is getting its revenge and killing you back. Was there poison in the tree? And where is the treasure that was up there?!
