## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ladle</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ladle</span> kanji are the same!
* Know your radicals, yo!
* You use a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ladle</span> to distribute soup. But as you're ladling you find something odd floating in the soup. It's... a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> toe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [と](https://jisho.org/search/と)</span>)! You scream, dropping the ladle and the toe on the ground.
* Your mom comes rushing in and smacks you on the head. Fool! she says, This is toe soup, what did you think you'd ladle up?! Oops.
