## Mnemonics
 * You see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> zombie</span> on it, going really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> far</span> away. Someone tied that zombie to the scooter and now it's far off in the distance, groaning and growling.
* Picture the zombie, going far off into the distance. It's getting smaller and harder to see.
* The zombie goes so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> far</span>, that its life <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> en</span>ds (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [えん](https://jisho.org/search/えん)</span>). Zombies need to eat to live (it's really all they need), but they go so far on their scooter trip, that they just give up and end it all.
* I mean, to be fair, the zombie wasn't really alive to begin with. But going far enough to end it all? That's some serious distance!
