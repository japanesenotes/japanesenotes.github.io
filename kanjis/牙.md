## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fang</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fang</span> kanji are exactly the same! Fantastic. Oh, also it means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tusk</span>. It means fang and tusk.
* Since the fang radical is the same as the fang kanji, that should be easy to remember. Tusks aren’t too different from fangs, so that shouldn’t be too hard to remember either.
* Lots of animals have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fang</span>s, even ones that don't look like they do. The coolest fang-having animal is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ge</span>cko (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [げ](https://jisho.org/search/げ)</span>)! They have pretty sharp little fangs in their mouths and they'll bite you if you keep tapping their glass cages like that. Cut it out.
* Picture a gecko with cute little fangs. You can keep thinking they're cute as long as one never bites you. They may be little, but gecko fangs are no joke!
