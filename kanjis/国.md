## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span> extends all the way around him (like in this kanji). Where his mouth reaches, that is his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> country</span>, give or take a few <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span>s.
* Imagine his talking taking physical form. As he talks, waves extend out from him, and stop right at the border of his country before getting to the next one.
* Turns out the king of this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> country</span> loves drinking <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Coke</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こく](https://jisho.org/search/こく)</span>). Every morning that big mouth of his swallows a whole 2-liter bottle of Coke for breakfast.
* Would you drink that much soda for breakfast? Now this king says he wants to pass a law requiring everyone in the country to drink nothing but Coke! That's crazy!
