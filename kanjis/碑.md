## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stone</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span>s from the sky into a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span> and then a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span>s on top of it. They've combined to form a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tombstone</span>! Wait, does that mean a body fell from the sky first and you just didn't see it?
* Imagine seeing a stone and a cross drop from the sky onto each other to form a tombstone right in front of your eyes!
* Now you're curious about what's under there but when you try to touch the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tombstone</span> it's radiating with intense <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> he</span>at (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひ](https://jisho.org/search/ひ)</span>)! It must have come from outer space and this heat is from when it entered our atmosphere!
* Can you feel the heat radiating off this space tombstone? Maybe there's a space skeleton sizzling under there too...
