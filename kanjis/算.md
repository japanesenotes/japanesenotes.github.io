## Mnemonics
 * If you get stabbed in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eye</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> twenty</span> times with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bamboo</span>, you’re going to have a hard time beginning to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> calculate</span> where anything is. Taking a bamboo shoot to the eye is no pleasant experience, especially if done twenty times. You’d be blinded for sure. And a newly blinded person is going to have one heck of a time calculating where everything is without the power of sight.
* Imagine getting jabbed with a bamboo shoot. Now imagine getting jabbed in the eye with a bamboo shoot. It’s going to hurt. Try and calculate exactly how painful this would be and imagine it happening to you.
* Do you know how <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> San</span>ta-san (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さん](https://jisho.org/search/さん)</span>) punishes naughty boys and girls in Asia? He doesn’t give them coal, Santa-san tortures them with twenty bamboo jabs to the eye. Yikes. Do you know how Santa-san <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> calculate</span>s who is naughty and who is nice? By their school grades, of course.
* Picture this evil Asian Santa-san, clad in blood red garments and brandishing pointed bamboo shoots in each hand. He’s a cold and calculating madman! You’d better start studying! Santa-san is watching!
