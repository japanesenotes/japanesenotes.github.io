 * Under the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> canopy</span>, you use a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> for your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> floor</span>. It also becomes your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bed</span>, because hey, what is a floor but the original bed?
* You lay it down, cut it into slats, and voila! A floor! And a bed!
* News of your amazing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> floor</span> / <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bed</span> spreads and reaches the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>), who wants to come see it. He's impressed, and asks you to build floor beds out of trees laying under this canopy in all of his buildings.
* This new floor + bed invention, along with your other accomplishments, have you being watched really closely by the Shougun now. He seems to be keeping an eye on you so he can swoop down and check out everything you do.
