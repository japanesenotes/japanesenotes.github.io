## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> at the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gate</span> of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span> makes sure all of his plants get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> watered</span>. The gate prevents the tsunami from damaging anything inside the king’s home, and the plants around the gate get watered by the water of the tsunami.
* Hear the tsunami crash into the gate as you see the water slosh around and make sure that all of the king’s plants get good and watered.
* These plants are getting <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> watered</span> in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> June</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゅん](https://jisho.org/search/じゅん)</span>), the month they need watering the most. June is a hot month, so it’s good that this tsunami came and got the king’s plants watered when it did.
* Again, watch and hear the tsunami crashing into the gate and getting the plants watered. This time, remember that the month is June and it is very hot and sticky outside. You’re sweating and very hot.
