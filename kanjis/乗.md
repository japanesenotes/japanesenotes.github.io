## Mnemonics
 * You put a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grain</span> in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> and take it for a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ride</span>.
* Just imagine you're a car or a train and the grain is a person. It's going for a nice ride in your mouth!
* You decide the grain is probably lonely on this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ride</span> alone, so you add some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> no</span>ri (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [の](https://jisho.org/search/の)</span>) seaweed, so it has a friend.
* Now the nori is going for a ride too, woohoo!
