## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spicy</span> radical and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spicy</span> kanji are exactly the same! Hot!
* 
* Imagine eating this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spicy</span> food, becoming blinded by the spicy heat, and knocking your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shin</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しん](https://jisho.org/search/しん)</span>) on something while you bumble around.
* It's bleeding profusely and really hurts a lot. Plus your mouth is still burning from that spicy food you ate. It's pure agony.
