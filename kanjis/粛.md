## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> wolverine</span> that <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stick</span>s its <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> legs</span> in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice</span> will become very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> solemn</span>, very fast. This is weird to you because wolverines always seem so happy. Well his dad died from his legs getting stuck in rice, so just leave the poor solemn creature alone.
* Imagine if your dad died from getting his legs stuck in some rice, now feel solemn too.
* Remember how <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> solemn</span> wolverine looked when his dad died? You hated seeing him like this so you ran up and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shook</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅく](https://jisho.org/search/しゅく)</span>) him. You shook the solemn sadness right out of him! You should do that again now!
* Imagine seeing how violently you shook him. You shook him so hard his solemn mood disappeared!
