## Mnemonics
 * You want to take a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> measurement</span> of what you're <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> writing</span> to make sure it's long enough to hand in to your professor, when you realize it's the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> opposite</span> of what you should be doing. You don't measure writing, you check things like word count and page numbers. Now it's going to be you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> versus</span> the teacher on who determines how long this thing you're writing should be.
* Okay. It's going to be you versus the teacher. Subject? Measuring physical length versus checking word count.
* You let your nerves get the better of you and right when it's about to be you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> versus</span> your professor, you hand him a new <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tie</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たい](https://jisho.org/search/たい)</span>). Is this also the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> opposite</span> of what you should be doing? Probably, since it's bribery. But no one can say no to a tie, right?
* Next to your nicely measured writing, tape a brand new tie with a sticky note that says, I hope this isn't the opposite of what you want, because I really need this A.
