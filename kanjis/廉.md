## Mnemonics
 * Under this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> canopy</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Mona Lisa</span>, being sold for cheap, what a great <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bargain</span>! You never know what kind of bargains you'll find when you look under a canopy at the wares of a traveling salesperson.
* Look really closely at this Mona Lisa. Hmm, I don't remember her having a mustache, but I guess it is a little dark under this canopy.
* You want to make sure this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bargain</span> is as good as it seems, so you ask if you can get this Mona Lisa as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ren</span>tal (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れん](https://jisho.org/search/れん)</span>). Just for now, so you can make sure it's real before you buy it at that low, low price.
* The salesperson pulls the painting away and mutters, Ah, yes, well this is such a good bargain already! And besides... it's already a rental, you see. From the, uh, the Louvre. So you really should just take this bargain and buy it!
