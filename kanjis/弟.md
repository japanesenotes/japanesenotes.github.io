## Mnemonics
 * There is someone with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bow</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stick</span>, wearing <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span>, going down a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span>. What type of person do you imagine? I'd say someone who's an immature boy. That would be your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> younger brother</span>.
* Just pretend you have a younger brother for now, if you don't. Also be sure to imagine this person really vividly. He is a stereotypical little boy, playing dress up with horns and a bow and stick (he can't have an arrow, that's dangerous), and he's going down a slide too.
* Unfortunately, he goes down this slide too fast, bounces off the bottom, and then falls right on his stick. It goes through him, causing your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> younger brother</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> die</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だい](https://jisho.org/search/だい)</span>). That's right, he's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> de</span>ad (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [で](https://jisho.org/search/で)</span>) now.
* Be sure to feel bad about your younger brother's death. He was your younger brother, after all… just not a very careful younger brother.
