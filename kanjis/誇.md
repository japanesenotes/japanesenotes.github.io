* You are trying to tell a beggar on the ground to say they are big, because you want to make the beggar feel a little pride. Have pride in your job as a beggar! you tell them.
* After giving some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pride</span> to the ground beggar, he looks up at you and tears off his beard and skin. I am a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 子</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span>) again, thanks to you!
* I'm not sure why gaining pride made the beggar revert back to being a child, but it seems like you did something good, maybe?
