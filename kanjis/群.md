 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> buddy</span> the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sheep</span> is part of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flock</span>. A flock of sheep. Your sheep buddy is a member of a flock.
* Imagine following your sheep buddy back to his flock. Feel the soft fur of all the sheep around you as they baa peacefully.
* Now take out your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gun</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぐん](https://jisho.org/search/ぐん)</span>) and murder every sheep in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flock</span>. Except for your buddy. You’re incredibly jealous of your buddy and you don’t like the attention his flock gives him so that’s why you decided to murder them all with a gun.
* Feel the recoil or the gun in your hands and the ringing of the shots in your ears as you slaughter the flock without remorse. BANG BANG BANG!
