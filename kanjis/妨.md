## Mnemonics
 * A woman will always obstruct whatever direction you want to go.<br><br>A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> woman</span> moving in one <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> direction</span> will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> obstruct</span> any other women coming from the other direction. Women are very stubborn, so when a woman decides she is going one direction, she will obstruct anything from getting past her or changing her course.
* Picture this woman, obstructing your path. She’s fuming and furious and won’t let anyone past her. Imagine how angry she looks and how terrified you are of her. It’s scary.
* Since this woman decided to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> obstruct</span> the path here, you need to figure out how to get past. Probably the best idea is to throw a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bow</span>ling (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼう](https://jisho.org/search/ぼう)</span>) ball at her. Bowling balls are heavy, so that will be sure to get her out of the way. Just throw a bowling ball in her direction.
* Now imagine that you are the woman. Feel the bowling ball hit you in the stomach as it crushes your ribs and knocks you back. Bowling balls hurt.
