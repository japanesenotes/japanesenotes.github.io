## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> treasure</span>s are in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> where there’s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ice</span>. How cryptic! You want to find the treasure, that’s for sure (treasure is great!). It is somewhere where there is ice, so maybe the arctic? What you are looking at is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> diagram</span> which will guide you there.
* Imagine looking at a diagram or map – and it has pictures of treasure in an area where ice is. This is where you will find the mystical treasure. This diagram will show the way. You're so excited that you found this map!
* What will you do when you find these treasures that are shown on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> diagram</span>? Well, you get there, and you find that the treasure is actually a wooly mammoth! What will you do with this wooly mammoth? You grab it and put it in your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> zoo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ず](https://jisho.org/search/ず)</span>).
* Imagine dragging a wooly mammoth back with you to the town or city you live in, then throwing it in a zoo to be kept. People are quite amazed by this mystical creature you’ve found, though, which is pretty cool.
