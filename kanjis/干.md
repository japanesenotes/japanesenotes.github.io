## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dry</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dry</span> kanji are the same!
* Know your radicals, yo!
* You need to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dry</span> Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>). He hates being wet, all of the Mongols do, so your job is to dry his entire body. And his clothes, and his horse. In fact, when it rains, you have to ride next to him keeping him dry by holding an umbrella above his head.
* Imagine keeping Genghis Khan completely dry all day every day. He won't even get wet to bathe. Instead he makes you rub his body with dry sand and salts.
