## Mnemonics
 * A man who is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> husband</span> material can <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> see</span> a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> standard</span> woman and think she’s the greatest thing ever. This man will make a great husband. Even though the lady is pretty standard, the husband treats her like she’s anything but.
* This husband sets a new standard for what it means to be a husband. He’s pretty great. Imagine yourself shaking this husband’s hand because he’s so awesome.
* It’s pretty <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> standard</span> for a husband and wife to exchange vows when getting married, and the husband said this girl held the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>) to his heart. She unlocked the husband’s heart with the key and now he’s a man made whole.
* Picture this woman actually sticking a physical key into the husband’s chest and turning it. Now this is anything but standard, but it’ll help you remember this kanji and its reading.
