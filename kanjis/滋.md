## Mnemonics
 * A (fresh water) <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span>. Some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span>. The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span>. A bunch of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> poop</span>. Combine these together and let them decompose a while. You'll have yourself some very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nourishing</span> soil.
* The stuff in horns is great for fertilizer. So is poop. So is water (as long as it's fresh water). So nourishing!
* This is the kind of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nourishing</span> soil that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Je</span>sus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span>) would make if he was into making soil, probably.
* Imagine him making soil made out of those things. Jesus approves of this nourishing soil.
