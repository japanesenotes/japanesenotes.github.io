## Mnemonics
 * The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> task</span> first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> task</span> as well.
* Make sure you know those radicals, yo!
* Today, your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> task</span> is to eat <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>gurt (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よう](https://jisho.org/search/よう)</span>). It's nutritious, it's delicious, and I'm telling you to do it, so you have to. A task is basically just something you have to do, so that's what this is.
* Eat your yogurt. (Gogurt doesn't count, don't @ me.)
