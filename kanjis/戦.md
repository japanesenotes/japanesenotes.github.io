## Mnemonics
 * Even a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> simple</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span> can start a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> war</span>. In fact, it's really common for one simple drunk person to offend an entire country into declaring war.
* Think about all of the people you know. You can picture at least one of them getting drunk and, I dunno, sending out a simple drunk tweet that starts the next world war. ¯\_(<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ツ](https://jisho.org/search/ツ)</span>)_/¯
* Welp, you woke up this morning and now you're at <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> war</span> with the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cen</span>taurs (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span>). This is especially unfortunate, because the centaurs are really good at <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> battle</span>s because they're all automatically cavalry troops.
* Imagine the war of humans vs centaurs. Do you really think the humans will win? Centaurs are really powerful and they have all of the same high tech weapons as us AND horse legs.
