## Mnemonics
 * If you want to have your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> wedding</span> in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> car</span> you're going to need a lot of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> help</span>. Cars are pretty small compared to weddings, so if you don't get help from everyone you know you won't be able to pull it off.
* Picture all of your close friends coming to help you squeeze everything for the wedding into your car. 
* You can't just ask for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> help</span> on the day of the wedding, either. You have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sche</span>dule (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すけ](https://jisho.org/search/すけ)</span>) getting your friends' help ahead of time. They might have pretty tight schedules too, so makes sure you plan early!
* Imagine calling all your friends and scheduling when you will get their help. Make sure you have your day planner ready!
