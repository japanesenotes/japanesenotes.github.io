## Mnemonics
 * Make <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> barracks</span> out of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gold</span> and they will get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dull</span> quickly. Gold is soft, it's okay for jewelry and delicate things that aren't used much, but barracks for soldiers? Those are used constantly, and they get worn out easily. What was once shiny gold will go dull in days.
* Picture a huge barracks made of dull, almost brown, gold. Maybe you should have picked a better material.
* As you stare sadly at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dull</span> barracks, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> don</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [どん](https://jisho.org/search/どん)</span>) shows up out of nowhere, and he's pissed. He turns his angry gaze toward you and says, How did my barracks get so dull? Are you at fault? This is bad, this is very bad. Someone will pay for this.
* You stand cowering in front of the don as he inspects how dull the gold barracks are. You don't wanna be off'd for this just because the don was dull enough to make you use gold!
