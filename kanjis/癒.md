 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sick</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Death Star</span> needs its <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cure</span>d. If it doesn't get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> healing</span> soon, it will die.
* Maybe the Death Star wouldn't be sick if it wasn't so mean to you, yelling at you for living in a yurt, when it was a yurt on the inside the whole time. Wait! I know the cure!
* You realized that the only way to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cure</span> the Death Star is to turn it back into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yu</span>rt (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆ](https://jisho.org/search/ゆ)</span>). Then it won't be able to do any more harm, and its outside will reflect its pleasant self on the inside!
* Hmm, but does this type of yurt healing technology exist?! You'll have to find out to cure it!!
