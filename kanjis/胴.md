## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> same</span> as your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> torso</span>. Because you’re so FAT! AHHAHAHAHAHA. I’m sorry, that was mean. But really, if your torso was as big as the moon, you’d have one large torso, y’know?
* Imagine if your torso was as large as the moon. You’re a gigantic human. Imagine floating around in space like this. Wooooaaaahhh.
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> torso</span> got so big because of all the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dough</span>nuts (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [どう](https://jisho.org/search/どう)</span>) you ate. You ate so many doughnuts that your torso got to be the size of the moon and then you floated away into space with your own gravitational pull and everything. Doughnuts are dangerous things.
* Imagine how many doughnuts you would have to eat to get your torso this size. Now imagine eating all of those doughnuts. I hope you like doughnuts, because you’re going to be eating a lot of them.
