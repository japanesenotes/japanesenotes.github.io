## Mnemonics
 * The radical <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> master</span> and the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> master</span> have the same meanings!<br />This kanji also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> main</span> because the master is the main person of a dojo or household or business.
* 
* Do you remember back to the radical mnemonic, where the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> master</span> is floating a water drop above his head? Imagine back to there. Once you do, the most amazing thing happens. The master sends the drop of water into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chu</span>te (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅ](https://jisho.org/search/しゅ)</span>) and it goes careening through an intricate series of them.
* Picture this master of water controlling the droplet as it flies around inside these chutes, like he's solving a difficult puzzle with it. Astounding!
