## Mnemonics
 * When the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> gets <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> together</span> with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> water</span>, only <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> violence</span> can ensue. They don’t mix well together. The sun loves to fight water and water loves to fight the sun. Lots and lots of violence.
* Picture this violent fight scene in your brain. Imagine water locked in battle with the sun as the sun’s fire flares up and the water starts to sizzle.
* But after a while, the sun and the water have had enough of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> violence</span>. They decide to settle their differences with a friendly game of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bow</span>ling (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼう](https://jisho.org/search/ぼう)</span>). Bowling is a great way to relieve stress and in the end, they bond over it.
* Imagine the sun and the water trying to bowl. Hear the sound of bowling balls rolling down the lane and pins rattling around and crashing together.
