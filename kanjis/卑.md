## Mnemonics
 * You <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> to the ground in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span>, and then <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> down in front of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> you keep on you because you're trying to make yourself as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lowly</span> as you can in front of God. He said to lower yourself and this is the only way you can interpret that.
* Imagine dropping down in a rice paddy, then again in front of your cross. Be as lowly as you can make yourself.
* The only problem about being <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lowly</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> he</span>at (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひ](https://jisho.org/search/ひ)</span>). Everyone always told you that heat rises, but not here. The rice paddy is incredibly hot... unless oh no. Is that the heat of hell?
* You tried to make yourself lowly in front of God but this heat is probably a sign that you didn't do it well enough.
