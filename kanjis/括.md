## Mnemonics
 * Someone's <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> touch your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tongue</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fasten</span> it together. You can't talk. All you can do is make sad tongue-less sounds as you try to figure out who would fasten your tongue like this.
* Try to fasten your own tongue with your fingers right now. You probably can't do it, right? That's because your fingers are too big and your tongue is too slippery.
* Only one creature could use its fingers to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fasten</span> your tongue like this: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cats</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かつ](https://jisho.org/search/かつ)</span>). Cats are notorious for fastening tongues so that people can't speak. Haven't you ever heard the phrase, Cat got your tongue?
* In this case, many cats fastened your tongue. You should probably be nicer to cats from now on so this doesn't happen again.
