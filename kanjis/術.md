## Mnemonics
 * Looks kinda like jesus on the cross, which is a theme for a lot of ART.<br><br>You see an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> angel</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> go</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> something outside your house. You run over and realize it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> art</span>. That angel is going around dropping framed art out of the sky and onto the people of earth!
* Of course an angel will go drop art everywhere. Why do you think so much art is of angels and naked baby angels and angels punching humans? Because it's all art they made of themselves!
* You didn't ask for this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> art</span> so you try to throw it back up into the sky at the angel. It doesn't like that (why would it?), and flies down to fight you. Too bad you didn't know that angels aren't just good at art. They're also trained in the art of nin<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> jutsu</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゅつ](https://jisho.org/search/じゅつ)</span>)!!!
* Now you're artfully getting your arse kicked by the ninjutsu of this angry angel!
