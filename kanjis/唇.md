## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> landslide</span> came out of your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> and created your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lips</span>. Before the landslide, you just had a wide open mouth hole.
* Picture your mouth as an open hole. Now a landslide of something (words? food? something worse?) comes pouring out, and when it's done you have lips. You flap them open and closed to test them out.
* Now you can use your new <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lips</span> to enjoy a nice, cold <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kuchi beer</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くちびる](https://jisho.org/search/くちびる)</span>). The Kuchi people are Afghan Pashtun nomads. They are lesser known for their amazing beer. And you've never been able to get this delicious beer into your mouth, but now that you have lips you can get it all in there.
* Imagine wrapping your new lips around the mouth of this Kuchi beer bottle. It's so good! And you aren't spilling any of it!
