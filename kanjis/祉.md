## Mnemonics
 * When a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spirit</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stop</span>s protecting you, you'll have to go on <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> welfare</span>. If you can't rely on your family spirit, you'll have to have the help and protection come from somewhere else.
* The next time you see someone on welfare, be nice. Their spirit stopped protecting them, so they need a little more help right now.
* While on <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> welfare</span>, you have to do the only job available to you: herding <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>). Sheep can help you out when you're having a rough time. Sheep provide warmth, wool for clothes, and even food, if you wanna get dark about it.
* If you've ever been on welfare you probably already know about the sheep.
