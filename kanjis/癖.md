## Mnemonics
 * When you get <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sick</span> you always eat a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hot pepper</span>. It's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> habit</span> you've picked up and you can't seem to shake it. One sniffle, one cough, and before you know it, you're eating a hot pepper or two.
* Imagine if you had a habit of eating hot peppers whenever you thought you might be getting sick. To be fair, it flushes out your sinuses and tastes good, so it's not the worst habit you could have.
* Everyone you know has a different <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> habit</span> when they get sick. Instead, they eat <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cous</span>cous (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くせ](https://jisho.org/search/くせ)</span>). But you think couscous is gross. It's bland and does nothing for your stuffy noses and scratchy throats. I wonder how you can convince them to replace their habit with your own.
* Unfortunately, now you've gotten into the habit of telling everyone what to do when they get sick. Yeah, yeah, eat a hot pepper, we know. But couscous is better, they say before you can speak. To each their own, I suppose.
