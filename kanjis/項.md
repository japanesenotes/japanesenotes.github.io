## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Construction</span> for <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> geoduck</span>s doesn't require as much paperwork as construction for humans, but you still need to write at least a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> paragraph</span> to explain what you're doing.
* Actually imagine yourself writing one paragraph of explanation to the city so you can get the permits to construct housing for your geoducks. On the form, it specifies you should only write a paragraph.
* You turn in your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> paragraph</span>, and it is given to Emperor <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>, who insists on being involved in all construction projects. Surprisingly, he approves your construction project, thanks to that paragraph you wrote in the application.
* In that paragraph, you praised <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち]([こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち)</span> for being a great emperor, and you said that this construction project would help you to have more time to do your WaniKani reviews. Clearly you were pandering to Emperor <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち]([こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち)</span> when you wrote it. But hey, it worked!<br />Hint: When you see <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [工](https://jisho.org/search/工)</span> in a kanji it will often take the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)</span> reading.
