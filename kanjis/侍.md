## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> temple</span> isn't a monk like you'd expect. It's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> samurai</span>, who protects the monks in return for prayers that keep him safe.
* You walk up to a temple and you're surprised to find that there's a samurai guarding it. Talk to him for a while so he can tell you why he has been doing this job. He's quite a nice guy, actually.
* The reading is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> samurai</span>, which should be easy enough to remember.
* If you know the meaning you know the reading as well! That doesn't happen too often with kanji, so consider yourself lucky!
