## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Dirt</span> makes it <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> easy</span> to identify your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> location</span>. If you know that, you can go from <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> place</span> to place.
* Imagine looking at the dirt. It's a distinct color and texture, and you're able to identify your location just from that alone.
* Knowing your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> location</span> from dirt is quite a feat! Who taught you that? It was <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Jou</span>rm (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょう](https://jisho.org/search/じょう)</span>), the big local farmhand. Despite being a bit weird, he does really know his dirt and can tell you the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> place</span> from which any dirt came.
* Remember Jourm? He's our local farmhand who only has nine toes (from the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [上](https://jisho.org/search/上)</span> mnemonic). Imagine that guy explaining to you how to know your location from dirt. He may be a bit clumsy, but the man really does know his dirt.
