## Mnemonics
 * This kanji is just the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> radical three times. Just based off this, you should be able to figure it out. This kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> forest</span>.
* Makes sense, because a bunch of individual trees is what makes up a forest!
* One tree? No. Two trees? Not enough. I want <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> more</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もり](https://jisho.org/search/もり)</span>) trees, please!
* Keep repeating this pattern over and over, continually focusing in on how you need more trees to make this forest. For some reason the person working with you only goes up by one at a time, though, so you have to say it a lot (it'll help you to remember, anyways!).
