## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mix</span>ed all around and begins to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> strangle</span> you.
* Just imagine thread everywhere, mixing in with everything. It's all around, and no matter where you go you get more and more caught in this thread. Eventually it tightens because you're trying to escape, and you feel yourself having trouble breathing. Imagine the moment when you realize you're getting strangled.
* As you are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> strangle</span>d you see who set this trap. (What else could it be, with all this thread everywhere?) It is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>, who just watches you as you lose consciousness, tapping his fingers together.
* In your final moments before you are totally strangled, you think you see a little thread come out of his butt. I should have done my WaniKani reviews is your last thought.
