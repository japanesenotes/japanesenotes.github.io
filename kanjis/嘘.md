## Mnemonics
 * Open your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span>. There is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tiger</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cactus</span> in there! You say one thing and your friend is scratched by the tiger. You say another and the cactus pricks your mom. That's what happens when all that comes out of your mouth is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> LIE</span>S!
* These aren't just metaphors. When you lie it really does cause a tiger and a cactus to hurt all of the people you lie to. That includes those you love, so don't lie!
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Lie</span> one more time and I'm going to put <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> u</span>ni <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> so</span>ap (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うそ](https://jisho.org/search/うそ)</span>) in that mouth of yours. That'll taste bad for you, the tiger, and the cactus, making it impossible for you to lie anymore.
* The next time you catch yourself telling a lie, take a bar of uni soap and put it in your mouth. It's disgusting! It burns! And it's the punishment for lying.
