## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> warehouse</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> warehouse</span> kanji are the same!
* Know your radicals, yo!
* You have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> warehouse</span> to store all of your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>ls (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>). When people or animals you know pass away, you take their souls and store them in your dry warehouse for safekeeping. It's a public service, really.
* Imagine if you kept a bunch of souls in a warehouse. This way they can't haunt anyone. And they can't get lost out in the spirit world. The warehouse is best for them.
