## Mnemonics
 * Next to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span>, there's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span> warning you that there are <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sheep</span> around here, so you should go <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> slow</span>.
* It's also a warning to the sheep that if they want to ride scooters they should also slow down, because as we all know, sheep are speed demons.
* You follow the flag, but the sheep refuse to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> slow</span> down so you have to get creative. You place <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chee</span>se (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ち](https://jisho.org/search/ち)</span>) every ten feet or so, that way the sheep slow down to bend down on their scooters and take a bite.
* Picture all of the sheep finally going slowly because there is yummy cheese all over the road.
