## Mnemonics
 * Once you remove the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lantern</span> from the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tent</span>, we will be ready for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> departure</span>. We can’t leave the lantern inside of the tent; that’s a fire hazard. We’d best take it with us before the departure. Don’t you agree?
* Feel the heat from the lantern. It’s not quite as comforting as being inside a tent, but it’s better than nothing. The lantern will light your way on your departure.
* Oh! Don’t forget your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hats</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はつ](https://jisho.org/search/はつ)</span>) either. Wouldn’t want to start a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> departure</span> without hats or a lantern. That’d be a short journey.
* How cold and unprotected would your head be without a hat? Very. Taking hats along with departures is integral to their success. Imagine how unsafe you would feel with no hats. That’s no departure I want to set out on.
