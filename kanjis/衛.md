## Mnemonics
 * If you want to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> go</span> to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Korea</span> you'll need a good <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> defense</span>.
* Things in Korea haven't been on the safest side lately, so make sure you have some ways to defend yourself before you go.
* You need a good <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> defense</span> to go to Korea, so you fill your pockets with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a</span>corns (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [えい](https://jisho.org/search/えい)</span>). When you get to Korea you plant them all around yourself. In no time you'll have a strong tree defense, keeping you safe.
* Okay, so maybe this defense strategy will take a while, but you aren't rich and acorns are on the ground for free. Don't judge!
