## Mnemonics
 * If a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sheep</span> is having trouble trying to eat a fish with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spikes</span> on its <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fins</span>, then the sheep probably has no <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> business</span> trying to eat it in the first place. Don’t sheep usually eat like, grass and stuff? What is this sheep doing trying to eat a fish with spikes on its fins? What silly business this is.
* Imagine this crazy sheep. Why is it trying to eat this fish? This sheep is blood crazed. Blood crazed for fish meat, especially the meat from fish with spikes on their fins. This crazed sheep means business.
* What’s this? The sheep is also trying to eat some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gyo</span>za (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎょう](https://jisho.org/search/ぎょう)</span>) dumplings! Where will this sheep’s madness end? First spikey finned fish and now gyoza? This is some crazy <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> business</span>.
* Imagine you’re at an Asian style restaurant and you just ordered a big plate of gyoza dumplings. Next thing you know, this crazy sheep busts through the front door and starts devouring all your gyoza! Where did this sheep come from and why does he love gyoza so much!?
