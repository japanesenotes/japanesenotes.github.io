## Mnemonics
 * Take your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> towel</span> and make it <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> long</span>. It has to be longer than that! For this will be your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> notebook</span>, which you will write all your notes in.
* You are making the towel really long, because it's white and it might be good for writing in. It's going to become your notebook.
