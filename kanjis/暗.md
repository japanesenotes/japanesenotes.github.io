## Mnemonics
 * If you yourself are a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span>, and you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stand</span> next to another <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span>, no area around you will be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dark</span>. The two suns are very bright and standing right next to each other, so all the area will be lit up and nothing will be dark.
* Think of how bright the sun is. Now multiply that by two. Suns are especially bright right after you come out of a dark area. Imagine yourself looking at these suns and feeling the pain as your eyes are blinded by the bright light.
* Since the sun has blinded you, your vision is now very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dark</span>. You can’t see anything, but you are hungry so you reach around for some food and eat it. Yuck! It’s <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> an</span>chovies (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あん](https://jisho.org/search/あん)</span>). You don’t even like anchovies, how did they get in your house?
* Picture yourself eating anchovies. The anchovies taste particularly fishy and salty. Taste the anchovies on your tongue as you eat them in darkness.
