## Mnemonics
 * If you put a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> over a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> valley</span> it will change its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> form</span>. Its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> appearance</span> will alter completely! 
* Picture a valley in your mind. Now put a roof on it. Hmm. It isn't <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shape</span>d like a valley anymore.
* Its new <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> appearance</span> looks familiar to you, like it's a big <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>gurt (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よう](https://jisho.org/search/よう)</span>) cup! A valley with a roof on it looks exactly like a yogurt cup. Huh!
* Now imagine this taking shape before your eyes and becoming actual yogurt! You grab a giant spoon and take a bite.
