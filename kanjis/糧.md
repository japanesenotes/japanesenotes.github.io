## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice</span> that's prepared at <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dawn</span> by the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> village</span> are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> provisions</span> for the army. The army is scheduled to arrive right after dawn, so all of the villages provisions for them have to be ready by then.
* Picture everyone in the village getting all of their rice together as provisions for the army. Even the kids and old people are helping out.
* Once all of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> provisions</span> are ready, the soldiers show up in their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> row</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りょう](https://jisho.org/search/りょう)</span>) boats and load it all up. But they aren't done there. Rice isn't enough, we need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> roe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ろう](https://jisho.org/search/ろう)</span>) so we will have the strength to row our row boats back. And so the village brings them all of their roe too.
* Picture the soldiers gobbling down their provisions of rice and roe in their row boats as they row away.
