## Mnemonics
 * You cast the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Mona Lisa</span> in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gold</span> and attach it to a stick to turn it into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sickle</span>! It's really big and bulky, but when you swing it fast enough your new sickle cuts lots of wheat! Just don't tell anyone what you did with the famous Mona Lisa painting and you should be able to get away with this!
* Imagine wielding your gold Mona Lisa sickle. It's sooo heavy, but it's really shiny and it cuts grass and wheat pretty well!
* Now that you've turned the Mona Lisa into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sickle</span>, you have to change the little description under its name in the Louvre. You draw a giant <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> comma</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かま](https://jisho.org/search/かま)</span>) next to Mona Lisa and write THE SICKLE. Then you shove it back on the wall as best you can.
* Hear all the guests say, Mona Lisa... comma the sickle? WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE?! As panic ensues. You like your addition and you're very proud.
