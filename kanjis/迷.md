## Mnemonics
 * If you're riding your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> through some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice</span>, it's likely you've gone <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> astray</span>. Also you might be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lost</span>.
* Usually there aren't paved areas inside areas of rice. You must be really lost if you ended up here with your scooter.
* You got so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lost</span> and went so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> astray</span> you ended up on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> May</span>flower <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> めい</span>, a ship that eventually took you across the Atlantic Ocean. Now you've really, really gone astray.
* How you got so lost that you ended up on an old ship from 1620 is beyond my understanding. But you did it.
