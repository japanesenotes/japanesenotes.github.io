## Mnemonics
 * If someone is coming toward you in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> car</span>, holding a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> weapon</span> in their <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hand</span>, they're going to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attack</span> you!
* Picture the car, weapon out the window, preparing to attack you full force!
* Right before the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> attack</span> begins, you recognize the hand holding this weapon and driving this car. It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Gecki</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [げき](https://jisho.org/search/げき)</span>), your long-lost gecko who you may or may not have let fly off into a really fierce tsunami. Oops. I think he may be here attacking you out of revenge.
* Gecki is attacking you now. He's hitting you over and over with his tiny car. He's yelling and smacking your ankles with his weapon. And all you can do is wait and let the attack happen, because you know you deserve it.
