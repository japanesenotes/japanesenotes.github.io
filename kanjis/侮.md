## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Every</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> will come to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> despise</span> their followers. In the beginning everything is fine and dandy, but eventually the leader's followers will ask for more and more things, eventually ridiculous things, and the leader will really despise them for it.
* Imagine yourself as a leader who's come to despise every single one of their followers. Look down at them in disgust as they ask you to grant them all a pony.
* The more you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> despise</span> them, the more <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boo</span>ze (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶ](https://jisho.org/search/ぶ)</span>) you drink. This is not smart or healthy, but it's what this kind of hate does to people.
* This is not a healthy way to handle things! If you despise someone you should talk to them, don't turn to booze. Don't be like every leader that's come before you.
