## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> call</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> call</span> kanji are the same. This kanji can also mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eat</span>, because why would you call someone if not to ask them to eat with you?!
* Call your mom or dad and ask them to go out to eat with you right now.
* You are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> call</span>ed to come <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eat</span> by the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>). He's been really impressed with you lately and he wants to chat over drinks, he says on the phone.
* Imagine getting a call from the Shougun himself. He's come to your house before, but he's never asked you to eat with him. This is huge!
