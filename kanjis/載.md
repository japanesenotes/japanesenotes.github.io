## Mnemonics
 * If you leave a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span>'s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> car</span> it's a sign that you'll <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> publish</span> everything if they try to drive. It's basically the universal symbol of, We're watching you, and we'll publish what you do, so don't drive drunk.
* Open your newspaper in the morning and you can see what's been published about all the drunkards who didn't pay attention to the crosses on their cars. They were all arrested and their stories were published for all to see.
* You need someone to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> publish</span> all these stories, so you get your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cy</span>borg (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さい](https://jisho.org/search/さい)</span>) to do it. It can keep an eye on all the drunkards cars through the special crosses you put on their cars. And the cyborg is a great editor, which is a plus.
* Picture your cyborg, with one of those newsie hats on, publishing stories about all of the bad drunk drivers so they never do it again. It's using its metal and meat arms to publish multiple stories at once.
