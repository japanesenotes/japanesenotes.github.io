## Mnemonics
 * For your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> car</span> you use a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hat</span>, some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bookshelf</span> to build a new <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wheel</span>. I mean, it's generally <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ring</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> loop</span> shaped, so it should work, right?
* Imagine this wheel you made out of a hat, some ground (presumably to keep it all together), and a bookshelf. You install it on your car and hope for the best. This is why you should buy wheels from professional wheel makers.
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wheel</span> is... generally <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rin</span>g (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りん](https://jisho.org/search/りん)</span>) shaped, so that's good.
* A ring-shaped wheel is better than nothing. Hopefully it will get you where you need to go.
