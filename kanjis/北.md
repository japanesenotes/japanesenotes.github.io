## Mnemonics
 * Balance a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spoon</span> on your pointed <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> and it will always point <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> north</span>. The spoon is like a compass needle and your fingers guide the knowledge your body already has and uses it to point north. That's science, friends!<br />Notice how the fingers radical is a little different here? That's because you're pointing them really hard.
* Imagine taking a spoon and balancing it on your fingers. Now watch the spoon spin spin spin until it stops and ultimately points north.
* You realize that this ability to find <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> north</span> is probably really valuable, so you go to the nearest pawn shop and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほく](https://jisho.org/search/ほく)</span>) it. Even your fingers.
* Imagine walking out of a pawn shop after hocking your fingers and spoon and realizing that you don't know where you are. Oh, if only you could tell where north was...
