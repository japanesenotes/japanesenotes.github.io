## Mnemonics
 * The type of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> insect</span> that ruins your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> writing</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mosquito</span>. You're trying to write, when you hear that horrible high-pitched mosquito noise in your ear. You jerk your head and swat and it's gone. But when you look down, there's lines all over what you were writing.
* Imagine sitting at your desk writing when a mosquito starts bzzzzing in your ear. You can't ignore it, it's gonna bite you. So you flail around helplessly.
* That <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mosquito</span> noise sounds like it's driving a tiny <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>) in your ear. How are you supposed to write with a bug driving around going bzzz bzzz like a revving car?
* You can't. You can't write like this. You need to kill the mosquito and its little car too.
