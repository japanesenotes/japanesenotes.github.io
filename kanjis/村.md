## Mnemonics
 * Someone’s taking <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> measurements</span> of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> trees</span>… Why is someone taking measurements of trees? These people are planning to take the trees and cut them down to make their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> village</span>.
* There is a whole group of people out there who are measuring these trees. Imagine them asking each other “do you think this will be a good tree for our village center?” and other people nodding in agreement or disagreement as they measure.
* They take all the wood back to where they're building their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> village</span> and once they construct the village center they paint a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mura</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [むら](https://jisho.org/search/むら)</span>) on the side of it. The mural is of the forest where they got the tree from so they remember the building's origins.
* Look at the mural on the side of this newly constructed village center. So many trees! Visualize the whole process as the tree becomes a building as you gaze and reflect on the message of the mural.
