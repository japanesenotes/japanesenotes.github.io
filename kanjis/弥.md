## Mnemonics
 * Go from a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bow</span> to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> small</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gun</span> and you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> increasing</span> in fire power! Even though the gun is small, it's still a step up from a bow.
* Imagine increasing your power with a new weapon. What would it be?
* You keep trading in weapons to get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> increasing</span>ly stronger gear, when you realize that at the top of the list is... a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ya</span>nkee's (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [や](https://jisho.org/search/や)</span>) baseball bat? Huh. I would have gone for a tank or a bazooka. But I guess if this will increase your power level, you have to go for it.
* Imagine walking down a line of weapons, each one increasing in power from the one before it. Bow, small gun, bigger gun, tank, Yankee's bat. Yup, that sounds right.
