 * An <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eye</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fins</span> litter the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span>. What happened? You killed a fish. You must hide the murder <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tool</span> before someone finds out it was you.
* You feel the panic upon realizing what you've just done. This is murder in the first degree. You used a terrible tool to do it, and now you must hide it.
* There’s <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> goo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぐ](https://jisho.org/search/ぐ)</span>) all over your hands. Goopy goo. It’s the guts of the fish you just killed and it’s dripping off of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tool</span> as well. Yuck.
* That goo is really slimy. It’s disgusting. You feel sick to your stomach. Please don’t throw up, there’s already enough junk on the ground with the eye and fins and all.
