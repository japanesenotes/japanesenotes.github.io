## Mnemonics
 * Always remember to give <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> umbrella</span>s to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spirit</span>s to show your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thanks</span>. The next time you're walking by a shrine and you see a statue dedicated to a spirit, leave your umbrella open to protect it. This is the best way you can show your thanks for life, food, shelter, and all that good, good stuff.
* Picture a spirit shrine with an umbrella protecting it from the heavy rain. Thanks for everything, you say softly.
* After you say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thanks</span> to a spirit, sometimes you'll get a gift back. You look down. There is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ray</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れい](https://jisho.org/search/れい)</span>) gun by your feet. Huh. Maybe you should show your thanks to the ray gun spirit more often.
* Thanks for the new ray gun, spirit!
