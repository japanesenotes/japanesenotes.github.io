## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cow</span> of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> righteousness</span> is always there for us. He is the cow that must <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sacrifice</span> himself for us to survive.
* The reason he is sacrificing himself is so we can all eat! Yum! Thanks to your sacrifice, righteous cow, we all have hamburgers. You should think about all the cows you ask to die for you every day. Maybe say thanks next time.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sacrifice</span> must be done via <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gui</span>llotine (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎ](https://jisho.org/search/ぎ)</span>). I know, I know, that sounds really brutal, but it's the best way. It's fast, it's effective, and hopefully the sacrifice—I mean, cow—doesn't feel a thing.
* Of course, the reading is also shared with kanji like <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [義](https://jisho.org/search/義)</span>. The righteousness radicals seems to have that effect on kanji.
