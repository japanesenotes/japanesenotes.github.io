## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> beggar</span> is pointing his <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> forehead</span> up at you, his feet trapped in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span>. What diabolical scheme are you planning with this poor beggar you trapped? Turns out, you're planning to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> copy</span> him to have your own version of him.
* You can imagine the whole story - him walking along, you setting a trap... and then whamo! You catch him. Then, come up with some crazy way / invention you're going to copy him. Are you cloning? Are you just taking his skin? Are you removing his forehead to grab his brain? Up to you - just make sure you make it ridiculous enough to remember.
* To remember the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゃ](https://jisho.org/search/しゃ)</span>, we use the word shaman.<br />You finally decide on how you're going to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> copy</span> him. You hire a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sha</span>man (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゃ](https://jisho.org/search/しゃ)</span>) and have the shaman perform a sacred shaman cloning ritual.
* The shaman runs around for a bit, doing ridiculous things. Imagine it dancing about and mumbling shamanic chants as the beggar is copied.
