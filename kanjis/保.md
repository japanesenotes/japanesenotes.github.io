* Basically, a tree leader is someone who stands up for trees. Mostly he talks, but that can be a powerful skill to have.
* He chains himself to a tree to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> preserve</span> them. But, unfortunately, the lumberjacks just take a giant back <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ho</span>e (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほ](https://jisho.org/search/ほ)</span>) and tear this tree leader and the tree he's attached to in half.
* What a terrible scene. Focus on the fact that they're using a horrible, modified back hoe. It's more like a weapon than a back hoe, and they show no mercy at all.
