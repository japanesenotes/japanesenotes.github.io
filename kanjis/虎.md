## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tiger</span> has <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> legs</span> that belong to a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tiger</span>. You know, a tiger has the legs of a tiger. This is common knowledge. Nothing new here.
* Look at the tiger running with his tiger legs. So majestic. So fierce.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tiger</span> is using his legs to run away from the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Torah</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とら](https://jisho.org/search/とら)</span>). This tiger is deathly afraid of religion, so a holy book like the Torah causes the tiger to run away.
* Imagine watching the tiger as it notices the Torah and then runs away. The tiger sounds as if it is screaming in terror as it flees from the proximity of the Torah.
