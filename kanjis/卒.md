## Mnemonics
 * Look how happy the kanji looks! It just GRADUATEd.<br><br><br>A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> person</span> puts a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lid</span> on their <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> after they <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> graduate</span>. It’s a symbolic gesture, putting the lid over the cross, but it’s just what you do when you graduate around these parts.
* Imagine a wooden cross and picture yourself putting a lid over it. Visualize this motion in your mind and imagine having to do something like this at your graduation.
* Oops, looks like you forgot your lid. Without the lid, you’ll be held back. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> So two</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そつ](https://jisho.org/search/そつ)</span>) more years now until you can graduate. So two more years, eh? Just for forgetting a lid? Nonsense!
* Imagine being held back two more years from graduation. You’d lose all your motivation. Imagine how lousy this would be.
