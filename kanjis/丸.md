## Mnemonics
 * What's something with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> nine</span> sides? Just add a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> and you'll have something that's almost a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> circle</span>.
* It's not quite a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> circle</span> though. You just need to add a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> of liquid to the edges to smooth it out to become a full circle.
* Do you know about the adorable cat Maru? If not, you should <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_AbfPXTKms>check it out</a>. May seem like a distraction, but if you come back knowing the reading for this kanji, then it's totally worth while.<br />When you think about a circle, think about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Maru</span> all rolled up in a little circle, being super adorable. Don't tell me it doesn't melt your heart just thinking about it.<br />Alternatively, you could also look at this kanji and think of Maru inside of a box, with his little tail sticking out of it. Whatever works best for you, just get yourself to Maru.
* Obviously if you don't know this reading well enough, you should watch some more Maru videos. I'll understand... just make sure you come back someday, okay?
