 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> life</span> is being cut off (that's why it looks like that) by a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> towel</span>, which you wrapped around the wound where this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span> went in. This towel is now <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> control</span>ling whether you live or die. The complex <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> system</span> of your life is wrapped up in there, and you don't want it spilling out.
* Imagine trying to control your blood loss to save your life with just a towel. You're squeezing as tight as you can.
* The knife person is coming back to take your life, but you take <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> control</span> of your own destiny, pull your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sa</span>ber (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せい](https://jisho.org/search/せい)</span>) out, and slice them in half!
* Your saber (and towel) have helped you control your own destiny. You did it! And now you need to get this system that is your guts stitched back up.
