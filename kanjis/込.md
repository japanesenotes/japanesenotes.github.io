## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> sits at the entrance where people <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> enter</span>. You jump on and are flung inside! Because a lot of other people did the same thing, it's really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crowded</span> in here.
* Imagine going to your favorite store. There's a scooter on and waiting at the entrance. You can't see inside, so when you are scooted inside by the scooter, you just get thrown into a packed room. So many other people on scooters! It's too crowded!
* Whoever came up with the scooter entrance idea, that made your favorite store so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crowded</span>? Only a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 子</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span>) could come up with something like this. They don't really think about the dangers and legal implications of using a scooter to launch people into a crowded space.
* Imagine a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span> at the head of a huge conference table. I know how to make our stores crowded again! they shout before showing everyone their plan drawn in Crayons.
