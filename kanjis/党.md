## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Viking</span> and his <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> older brother</span> join a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> party</span>. They can raid and pillage better in a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> group</span> like this, so it makes sense that the Viking and his older brother would join a group with other Vikings.
* Look at this big group that contains the Viking and his older brother. Hear them shouting as a group and imagine their Viking battle cry.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> party</span> has decided to raid <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> とうきょう</span>. It’s a large undertaking, but they have a large group of Vikings on the job. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span> doesn’t stand a chance.
* Imagine this group of Vikings rampaging through <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span>. See all the Japanese people running away and screaming as the group of Vikings comes busting in, swinging their axes and shouting loudly.
