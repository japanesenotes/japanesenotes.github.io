## Mnemonics
 * Reaching your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ear</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sound</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span> who can’t find <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> employment</span>. You hear him before you see him because he’s behind some trash cans. Being a drunkard, he’s like, super wasted and just kind of rambling to himself, making strange sounds. No wonder he can’t find employment.
* Hear the strange sounds this drunkard is making. Let his ramblings enter your ears and imagine what he could be trying to say.
* Since this guy is such a pathetic drunkard, it comes as no <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょく](https://jisho.org/search/しょく)</span>) that he can’t find <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> employment</span>. If he did find employment, I would be filled with both shock and awe.
* Actually you find out that he does have employment. He’s a garbage man. Feel the shock of making this shocking discovery. How can this drunkard possibly hold down his job like this?
