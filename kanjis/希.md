## Mnemonics
 * There is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> treasure</span> on top of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> narwhal</span> who wears a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> towel</span> that will grant your greatest <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wish</span>.
* Picture this narwhal: above its long horn there is a huge, shiny treasure floating. It pulls the towel tight around itself, Brururu you found me I see! it whistles at you.
* In order to open the treasure and get your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wish</span>, you need the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>). The narwhal knows where it's hidden, so you'll have to convince it to tell you where the key is.
* If you find the key, what will you wish for? Think about your single, greatest wish. Close your eyes and picture it as clearly as you can and you'll find the key.
