## Mnemonics
 * Coming down with the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rain</span> is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> two</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spikes</span>. They go right through two <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ghost</span>s.
* The ghosts are pinned to the ground by the spikes, unable to move. 
* You come across the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ghost</span>s, who are stabbed into the ground. Please, they beg. Please use that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ray</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れい](https://jisho.org/search/れい)</span>) gun that's in that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> row</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りょう](https://jisho.org/search/りょう)</span>) boat and end our suffering.
* A ray gun, coincidentally, is the only thing that can kill a ghost, and there it lays, just out of reach. You'll have to be the one to pull the trigger of the ray gun. Do you pick up the ray gun out of the row boat to destroy the ghosts?
