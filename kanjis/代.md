## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> for the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ceremony</span> can't come so you need a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> substitute</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> replace</span> them ASAP!<br />This kanji has another meaning too. The leader can't come to the ceremony because they forgot what <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> period</span> of time it was. If they think they're in the wrong <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> age</span>, they won't come because they're trying to lead some monkeys in the ceremony instead.
* Picture the leader of the ceremony out back, unsure of what period or age they're in, while the substitute leader walks in and stares at them in shock.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> substitute</span> leader is wearing the wrong color clothes, so you have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dye</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だい](https://jisho.org/search/だい)</span>) them, like they did in the olden <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> age</span>s.
* Now you're out back with the original leader and the substitute leader, trying to dye the color of this stupid shirt to match that one.
