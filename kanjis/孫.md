## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> child</span> shares his <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lineage</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grandchild</span>. The child passes his lineage down to his child and then that child’s child is the grandchild and between them all a lineage is shared.
* Look at this family tree. See the child, and then the grandchild. Trace the lineage with your finger as you observe.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> son</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そん](https://jisho.org/search/そん)</span>) of a son is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grandchild</span>. In this case, a grandson. Easy.
* Just remember that a son is all you really want. You need a son to carry on the family name and the lineage. So make sure that your child and your grandchild are both sons.
