## Mnemonics
 * You need to put a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> clown</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> if you want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cultivate</span> good crops there. Clowns act as a natural fertilizer, and this will make it super easy to cultivate any crops you could ever want in this dirt. Isn't nature amazing?
* Imagine burying a dead clown in the dirt and then planting some seeds on top. It's worth it, you think, if it helps cultivate your crops.
* Before you can start this whole <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cultivation</span> process however, you have to say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bye</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばい](https://jisho.org/search/ばい)</span>) to the clown. Say bye to him, then bash his head in, and drop him in the dirt.
* Saying bye is polite. Never forget to say bye, even in the middle of a cold-blooded clown murder.
