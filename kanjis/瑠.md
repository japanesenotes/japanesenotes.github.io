## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span> will send his men with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sword</span>s into your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> private</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span> if you come across <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lapis lazuli</span>. Even though this is your private land, he wants that lapis lazuli to make some new crowns and thrones for himself. Plus he's the king, so he can do whatever he wants.<br />If you've never taken an art history class (or played Minecraft) you may never have come across lapis lazuli, but think of it as a pretty, blue precious stone that people really, really liked in the olden days.
* Watch the king's swords digging in your private rice paddy and digging up huge chunks of lapis lazuli. This isn't fair, that lapis should belong to you.
* You run up and ask how this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lapis lazuli</span> thievery isn't illegal and one of the swordsmen just shouts, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Loo</span>phole (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [る](https://jisho.org/search/る)</span>)! What? What loophole? What law says that the king gets to steal your stuff?
* Imagine reading through a giant text called The Law and looking for this loophole the king's men claim to have about taking your lapis lazuli. You can't find it... but maybe if you search just a bit longer...
