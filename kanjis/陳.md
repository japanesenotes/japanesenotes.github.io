## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span> to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> east</span> is an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exhibit</span>.
* It's a pretty large building and you can see inside to all of the different exhibits within the main exhibit.
* Right now the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exhibit</span> has a bunch of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chin</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちん](https://jisho.org/search/ちん)</span>) on display. Animal chins, human chins, every chin you can think of is in the exhibit.
* Go up to the first exhibit and look very closely at some turtle chins, then some crab chins, then some alligator chins. This is weirdly familiar.
