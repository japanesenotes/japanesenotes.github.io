## Mnemonics
 * Wipe your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> on this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> table</span> in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> to see what it was <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> based on</span>. The cold winter weathers cover the table in frost, and when you wipe it away, you can see traces of what the table was originally based on. All tables have to be based on something, even if it's just other tables that came before them.
* Imagine tracing your fingers over the table, the cold winter frost stinging them, as you reveal the secrets of this table and what it was based on.
* This particular table was <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> based on</span> the design on Little <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kyo</span>to (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょ](https://jisho.org/search/きょ)</span>). You feel the little, cold designs that were inspired by Little Kyoto. There are tiny little temples and shrines carved into the table that you could only find this time of year.
* The table was based on Little Kyoto, but it probably wasn't made there. What a shame.
