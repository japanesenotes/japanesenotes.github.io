## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span> can <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> see</span> the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> present time</span> for what it really is. The future isn't important. The past isn't important. The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> present</span> is where it's at.
* People are constantly asking the king to do things for them and solve their problems. But the king can see exactly what needs to be done at the present time, and what can wait until tomorrow.
* At the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> present time</span> the king is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Gen</span>ji (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [げん](https://jisho.org/search/げん)</span>). The time has finally come for him to get serious, and as they say, there's no time like the present.
* Picture pretty Genji, carefully instructing his followers what to do at the present time and what can wait.
