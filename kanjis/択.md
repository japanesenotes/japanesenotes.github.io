## Mnemonics
 * Shove your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> into a bowl of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shrimp</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> select</span> the best one. You know your shrimp and you know them well, so you won't settle for anything less than the best. Put your whole arm in there and feel around until you can select the one you want most.
* Feel your fingers touching each and every shrimp, one by one, until they graze the one you select as the perfect shrimp. Slowly pull it out and lower it into your mouth. Munch munch... ahhh! The perfect shrimp.
* You do this at every restaurant, party, and indoor sporting event and people start getting wise to your shrimp <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> select</span>ion methods. One day, as you attempt to select your shrimp, a sharp pain shoots through your finger. Ow! You pull your hand back to find... a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tack</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たく](https://jisho.org/search/たく)</span>)!
* Oh, woe is me! How will I select the perfect shrimp with my fingers if there are tacks in the shrimp bowls! Boohoohoo!
