## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> crab</span> left on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> for a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> period of time</span> will surely die. Crabs aren’t meant for the moon, let alone outer space. Why would you take a crab to the moon? You take it outside the spaceship for any period of time and it will surely die.
* I’m sure you’ve seen movies where people go out in space with no spacesuit. Now imagine this happening to the poor crab. It only takes a small period of time for the dark reaches of space to kill him.
* In order for this crab to live on the moon for any <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> period of time</span>, you’re going to need to put him in a special moon aquarium and lock the lid with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>). This crab is crafty, so after you lock it, take the key with you and don’t let it out of your sight for any period of time. This crab knows how to use a key.
* Imagine this crab floating around in an aquarium half filled with water in little to no gravity. The water is floating all about and the crab is confused as can be. He just wants the key so he can get out of this crazy moon box and back to the real ocean where he belongs.
