## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Say</span> it at <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> noon</span>. That's the only time I will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> allow</span> you to say it. That's the only time I will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> permit</span> you to say it. Other than that, no saying anything. Noon is your window.
* Imagine a world where you're not allowed to say anything except for at noon. At that moment, after you've been staring at the clock, waiting for that opportunity, you burst forth with things you want to say. But, once it hits 12:01, you are grabbed and your mouth is covered. You are not permitted to say anything outside of that time.
* Where do these archaic horrible rules exist? The smaller version of Kyoto, Little <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kyo</span>to (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょ](https://jisho.org/search/きょ)</span>). Normal Kyoto is just fine. This smaller one is where a group of people went to create their own little town with their own dumb rules.
* Imagine going to big Kyoto where everything is fine. Then, go to little Kyoto where it's not. Little Kyoto has the short <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょ](https://jisho.org/search/きょ)</span> (instead of the long one), and this is how you can remember the difference.
