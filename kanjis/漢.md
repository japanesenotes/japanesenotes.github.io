## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> hit ancient <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> China</span> and formed the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chinese</span> country we know now as... <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> China</span>!
* Picture the world way far away, from space. You see a giant tsunami carve out a massive chunk of land to the west of Japan on the main continent. Slowly the tsunami waters recede, leaving the outline of China.
* You peer closer at <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> China</span> and realize the borders are inching inward, even though the tsunami is already gone. You look even closer and see the Mongols, being led by Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>) moving in to conquer all of the Chinese people living in China!
* Watch as the Khan takes China for himself. A tiny little flag with a horse on it is raised in the middle, for all of the Chinese people to see. Hmm, this could be a problem.
