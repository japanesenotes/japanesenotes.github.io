## Mnemonics
 * Whatever you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> through a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> satellite</span> turns into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Noh chanting</span>. It gets all drawn out and distorted from going through the satellite, which makes it SOUND like Noh chanting at least.
* Say whatever you want and send it up to the satellite. Now imagine listening to it when it comes back and hearing beautiful, deep Noh chanting back!
* While you're fake <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Noh chanting</span> you have to pause every few minutes to take a bite of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>gurt (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よう](https://jisho.org/search/よう)</span>). Yogurt is good for the throat! At least you think it is. It's not like you're actually chanting, the satellite is doing all the real work.
* Watch closely the next time you go to a Noh play. See the man Noh chanting? Watch close enough and you'll see him eat a scoop of yogurt every once in a while.
