## Mnemonics
 * On the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> above</span>, is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> small</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span>. Anyone who sits in that stool will be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lonely</span>.
* Imagine sitting on this small stool, waaaaay up there above the roof. You can't see anyone and you can't talk to anyone. You feel this awful emptiness inside. That's what it's like to be lonely.
* You're so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lonely</span>, you make up an imaginary friend: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Jack</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゃく](https://jisho.org/search/じゃく)</span>). Jack doesn't get rid of the lonely feeling because he isn't real, but he is a distraction at least.
* You're so busy talking to Jack, you don't hear the voices from below, Aren't you lonely up there, miss? Do you want us to get a jack to get you down? Hello? I don't think she can hear us...
