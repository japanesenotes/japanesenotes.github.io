* Picture the person next up for king. They have to sit in a chair behind the current king, and as they glare in front of them with envy, horns start to sprout out of their head.
* If they can't control their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> envy</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> jealousy</span>, they'll start growing hooves and extra legs, until one day, they turn entirely into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cen</span>taur (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span>)! A jealous centaur, who will never be king.
* Centaurs can't be the next king, so people really need to be careful about how much they let jealousy consume them. If you don't watch out, you'll turn into something ugly and twisted.
