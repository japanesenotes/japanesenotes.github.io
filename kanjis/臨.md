 * You give your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> servant</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gun</span> along with some other <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> products</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> look to</span>. You can’t look to them yourself since you are very busy. You allow your servant to look to your gun and the other products.
* Imagine your servant as he looks to your gun and products. You can always look to him to take care of your menial tasks. You feel smug.
* After your servant is done with your gun and other products you want him to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> look to</span> your car’s o-<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rin</span>g (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りん](https://jisho.org/search/りん)</span>). There’s something wrong with the o-ring so you want your servant to look to that as well.
* Imagine your servant as he looks to your car’s o-ring. Hear him clinking and clanking around in the garage as he does so.
