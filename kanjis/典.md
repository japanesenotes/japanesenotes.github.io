## Mnemonics
 * If you play <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> music</span> with your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fins</span>, one <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rule</span> is that you must be a fish. You can’t play music using fish fins that don’t belong to you. That’s the rule. And it’s also rude.
* Imagine a fish playing music using his fins. What kind of a song is it? Imagine it in your head as you see a sign with the fish fin rule on it.
* There’s also a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rule</span> in place to limit the amount of fish fin musicians. No more than <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ten</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てん](https://jisho.org/search/てん)</span>) are allowed to gather and play their music together. That’s the rule. No more than ten.
* Picture a group of ten (as per the rule) fish playing music with their fins. Now the song can be louder and more intricate. Imagine it playing in your head.
