## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hundred</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> forehead</span>s in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span> of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> superior</span> at being <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gentle</span>. These hundred foreheads are sensitive, especially in the heart of winter, so the leader must be very gentle. Not just any kind of gentle though—the superior kind of gentle that will keep a hundred foreheads following.
* As a leader, you are superior. You’re so gentle to these foreheads. See yourself caring for them in the winter. Feel the chill in the air as you wrap the foreheads in blankets and prepare heating pads for them.
* You need to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> superior</span> because all of these foreheads belong to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> you</span>ths (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆう](https://jisho.org/search/ゆう)</span>). They don't know how to take care of themselves, though they try to convince you they can. They're too young to know any better.
* Picture the youths trying to show you that they are the superior ones, then they sneeze, their eyes fill with tears, and you have to gently tuck them back into bed. Silly youths.
