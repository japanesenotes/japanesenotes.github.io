## Mnemonics
 * This isn't exactly the same as the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fins</span> radical, but it's close. Sometimes this will happen (where we have to use a slightly modified radical version of the original), so it's good to understand that now, early on. In this case, we have fins. How many fins? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Eight</span> fins. How do you know that? Because you caught four fish with two fins each.
* Count the fins out in front of you, all the way from one to eight. It'll help if you actually do this. Now smell each fin, and think Wow, I have to smell all eight of these? Yes, you do.
* After you count and smell all <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eight</span> of your fins, it's time to put them away. You open a large <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hatch</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はち](https://jisho.org/search/はち)</span>) and put them in. This is where you keep your fins, always putting in eight at a time because that's what the boss wants.
* You've asked him why you can only put eight fins at a time in the hatch, but he never wants to answer. What could be down in the hole that the hatch covers? Why is there a hatch at all? What's with numbers and hatches being mysterious?
