## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> root</span> is still just a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> root</span>!
* Roots are roots, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ね](https://jisho.org/search/ね)</span>.
* Tree <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> root</span>s are the perfect roosting place for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> con</span>dors (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こん](https://jisho.org/search/こん)</span>). Unfortunately, living on roots is also why they're always endangered. Condors can be killed pretty easily living on the ground on roots like this.
* Picture a family of condors nestled at the bottom of a tree in its roots. Then a huge machine comes over and mows them all down as it cuts all the trees off their roots. Darn you humans! Do you have to ruin everything?!
