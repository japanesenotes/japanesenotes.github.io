## Mnemonics
 * You hit a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> with an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> axe</span> so you can do some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> analysis</span> on it. To do the analysis on the tree, a cross section needs to be obtained, so you must chop it in half with your axe.

Who is this sexy person? Why it’s you of course, you sexy beast. I love watching you do analysis on trees. It’s so sexy.
