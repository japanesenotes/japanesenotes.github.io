## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> demon</span> on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> jet</span> is pretty <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alluring</span>. Demons themselves are pretty intriguing, but put one on a jet? Now that’s alluring.
* See this demon flying around in his jet. Do you feel allured? You should. Hear the roar of the jet engine as the demon cackles.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alluring</span> demon on a jet wants one thing and one thing only. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Me</span>at (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [み](https://jisho.org/search/み)</span>). Human meat. This demon needs human meat to survive so he is taking his jet into the city to feast on some meat.
* The demon won’t be so alluring once you see him scarfing down humans, tearing the meat from their bones. How gross.
