## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> woman</span> who is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> good</span> is my <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> daughter</span>. My daughter is a good woman, I guarantee it.
* Look at how good this woman is! She’s my daughter! She’s good! You wish your daughter was as good a woman as mine is!
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> daughter</span>, on the other hand, is not a good woman. Your daughter looks like a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> moose who may</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [むすめ](https://jisho.org/search/むすめ)</span>) not be able to find its way out of a wet paper bag. Your daughter looks like a moose who may lose its way without a map. Your daughter looks like a moose who may do lots of stupid things.
* Think about how your daughter is basically a moose who may do dumb things. How ashamed you feel. How very, very ashamed. Unlike how I feel about my wonderful, perfect, not a moose-like daughter.
