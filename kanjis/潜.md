## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> carries a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> husband</span> and his <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> husband</span> up into the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> where they <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> conceal</span> their centaur. The two husbands run a centaur farm, but the local government isn’t too pleased by this so they have to conceal their centaurs in the sun unless they want them to be confiscated by the government.
* Imagine the tsunami carrying the husbands and the centaur up into the sun. Hear the water gushing as they conceal the centaur up there. That tsunami is gigantic.
* What is it the husbands are going to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> conceal</span>? Oh that’s right, a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cen</span>taur (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span>). They are concealing a centaur in the sun. How forgetful of you.
* Just make sure to remember there is a centaur up on that tsunami with the husbands. They need to conceal the centaur to keep it safe.
