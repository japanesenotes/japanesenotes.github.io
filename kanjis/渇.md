## Mnemonics
 * You're stuck in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> prison</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> with nothing but a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spoon</span>. Lucky for you a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> is coming, so you take your spoon and use the tsunami to quench your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thirst</span>. You spoon the hot, hot water into your mouth as fast as you can. This is the only way to get water on the sun.
* Imagine this thirst of yours. You've been in this sun prison for longer than you can remember. You've been holding onto this spoon, waiting for this moment for so long.
* This method of quenching your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thirst</span> reminds you of being in a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wa</span>sh (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かわ](https://jisho.org/search/かわ)</span>). The water pours over you in waves, and you're stuck inside a metal cage. Totally the same thing as a car wash, right?
* Imagine quenching your thirst in a real car wash. Open your mouth and let the soapy water dump on over and in you. You'll never be thirsty again!
