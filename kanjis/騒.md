## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horse</span> gets trapped in a small room with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span> and an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> insect</span>, and together they create a very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boisterous</span> situation. The horse and the insect are both scrambling frantically to get out of the small room, knocking the stool around all over the place.
* Imagine the boisterous sounds coming from this small room. Hear the horse neigh and stomp his hooves, hear the insect buzzing loudly, and hear the wooden stool rattle around as the horse and insect try to escape the room.
* At the height of their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boisterous</span> sounds, there's a sudden, awful CRONCH(!) and you see the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>) of the insect slowly rising out of the room, through the ceiling.
* The horse gets even more frightened now that it killed the insect and saw an actual soul float by its head and it grows even more boisterous.
