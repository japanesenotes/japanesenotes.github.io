## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spoon</span> is a powerful thing. Even something like a spoon when given to the right man or woman can make great <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> change</span> in the world.
* Imagine your leader-hero holding a spoon out, then doing something awesome with it to totally <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> change</span> everything for the better. It's amazing the change this person can do with such a blunt, small, device!
* Then, this hero of yours takes their spoon and says some magic words into it, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> changing</span> it into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> car</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>).
* Of course, doing something like this is utterly amazing. Feel amazed in your imagination, because if you don't, then it'll be hard to remember the reading for this kanji. If you are amazed, you'll know that spoons going to cars = the reading is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>, so make sure you take the time to be amazed.
