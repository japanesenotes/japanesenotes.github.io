## Mnemonics
 * An <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> odd</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horse</span> is still a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> horse</span>. It may look a little funny, but that doesn't change what it is on the inside.
* Look at this odd horse. Hear it whinny and neigh like a normal horse. It's not so odd, after all.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> horse</span> is particularly odd because it knows how to use a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>). It carries a key around its neck and uses it to get in and out of its stable.
* Watch the horse take the key in its mouth and open the stable doors. It may be odd, but it sure is resourceful.
