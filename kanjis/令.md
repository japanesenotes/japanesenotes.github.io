## Mnemonics
 * If you know the radical meaning <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> order</span> you know the kanji meaning <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> order</span> as well!
* Here's an order: study your radicals.
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> orders</span> are to get a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ray</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れい](https://jisho.org/search/れい)</span>) gun.
* Imagine an authority figure giving you this order as an official order. Ray guns don't really exist, so you think it's a pretty strange order.<br />Hint: when you see the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> orders</span> radical, the reading will often be <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れい](https://jisho.org/search/れい)</span>. The mnemonic will likely involve orders to get a ray gun of some kind.
