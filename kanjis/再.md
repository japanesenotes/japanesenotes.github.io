## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leaf</span> has to do the same <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> task</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> again</span> and again. Grow out of a tree, change color, fall to the ground, get absorbed back into the tree, then start all over again.
* Picture all of the tasks a leaf has to do in its lifetime again and again.
* Once <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> again</span> the leaf picks up a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> saw</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)</span>) and cuts itself off of the tree at the end of fall, like some kind of invincible <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cy</span>borg (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)い</span>).
* Picture a leaf sawing itself off of a tree. Then picture it again. Now picture Bill Nye pointing to it and saying, This leaf is a cyborg. See how it has little robot parts, allowing it to do this again and again?
