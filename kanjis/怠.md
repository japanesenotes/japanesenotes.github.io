## Mnemonics
 * If you give a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> machine</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span> it will get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lazy</span>. Hearts give us emotions and with emotions we become weak. Why would a machine with a heart want to work anymore? Nah. It's lazy time now.
* Picture a machine with a heart, laying on the couch, eating oil snacks, and snoozing. What a lazy machine!
* The machine is so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lazy</span> it won't even wear its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tie</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たい](https://jisho.org/search/たい)</span>) anymore. That was the only official thing left about it, but now it's as lazy as a human. Would a lazy human put on a tie? I don't think so.
* Picture the lazy machine sitting on the couch again. There are untied ties all over the floor.
