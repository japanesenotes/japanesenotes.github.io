## Mnemonics
 * If you have a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> big</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> but a good <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span>, people will recognize your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kindness</span>. Even if you blabber on with your big mouth, as long as everyone knows that your heart is filled with kindness, they will love and accept you.
* Share your kindness with the world. Use your big mouth to let people know what you’re doing. “I’M TAKING OUT THE TRASH AND NOBODY EVEN ASKED ME!” Y’know, that sort of thing. Go ahead and say that out loud a few times.
* To further show your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kindness</span>, you chop up some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> on</span>ions (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おん](https://jisho.org/search/おん)</span>) for a friend who always cries when they chop onions. The onions make you cry too, so it’s a nice act of kindness that you’re toughing it out for your pal.
* Imagine chopping up these onions. Smell the onion smell in the air as your eyes begin to sting from the onions. Your friend had better appreciate this kindness.
