## Mnemonics
 * If the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span> gives you a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span> you become part of his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> squad</span>. Every king has a knife squad or two protecting him and making sure his subjects keep in line.
* Imagine if you were given a knife and allowed into the king's squad. Would you let the power corrupt you?
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> squad</span> is led by <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Han</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はん](https://jisho.org/search/はん)</span>) Solo, so it's basically a 50/50 shot that the king is gonna die.
* I'm not saying Han Solo is a bad squad leader, but his track record isn't the greatest. I mean, best case scenario the king gets stabbed in the arm and they manage to win.
