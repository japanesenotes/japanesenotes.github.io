## Mnemonics
 * The radical <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> car</span> and the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> car</span> are exactly the same.
* Make sure you study your radicals... though don't do it while driving.
* When we need to remember the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゃ](https://jisho.org/search/しゃ)</span>, we use shaman.<br />There's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> car</span>. It's the nicest car you've ever seen. Exquisite, beautiful. Wouldn't you be surprised to learn it belongs to a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sha</span>man (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゃ](https://jisho.org/search/しゃ)</span>)? Well it does. This shaman charges a premium for his shaman services so he can afford fancy cars like this.
* The more fantastic you make this car, the better. Also, feel the surprise of a shaman getting out of this car. What a cool dude that shaman is.
