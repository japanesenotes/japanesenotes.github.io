## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> sitting on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span> is something every ship has in its crow's nest. That's why the universal <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ship counter</span> is a turkey on a stool. Not a crow.
* Picture yourself counting ships by pointing your finger from one turkey propped up on a stool to the next. You'll be the best ship counter in the world at this rate!
* Once you become the best <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ship counter</span> in the world everyone will think you are super <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sexy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せき](https://jisho.org/search/せき)</span>)! Nothing is sexier than being able to count, and counting ships is the sexiest thing you can count.
* Imagine yourself, a sexy ship counter. Sexily counting ships. You go guy/girl/non binary person! So sexy!
