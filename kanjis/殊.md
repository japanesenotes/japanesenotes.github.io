## Mnemonics
 * If the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> yakuza</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span> you into a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> jet</span>, things are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> especially</span> bad for you. Not just normal bad, like, especially bad.
* First of all, the yakuza have you, that's bad already. But they're sliding you into their jet? That means you aren't upright, you might even be knocked out or dead. That's especially worrying, don't you think?
* You're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> especially</span> worried now, because they're putting you in some kind of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chu</span>te (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅ](https://jisho.org/search/しゅ)</span>). You already took a slide in here, and now you're teetering over the edge of a dark, steep chute into who knows where!
* As you slide down the chute, it's especially dark. And especially scary. And especially bad! How did this happen to you?!
