## Mnemonics
 * Under this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> someone <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> odd</span> is trying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> approach</span> you. You back up, but they continue their approach anyway.
* Imagine being under the same roof as an odd person who wants to approach you. You don't want anything to do with them, but they won't back off.
* They <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> approach</span> too closely and you can't take it anymore. You run out from under the roof, slam the door closed, and lock it with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>).
* You hold the key tightly in your hand and press your ear to the roof. You can still hear the odd person... thing(?) approaching. Hopefully this key keeps it away.
