## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mountain</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stone</span> is probably going to be a really big stone. We're talking about a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boulder</span> here.
* This kanji makes a lot of sense. Just follow the logic.
* Although it doesn't share the kanji, this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boulder</span> shares the reading of the first part of the famous Iwajima (where a big battle in WWII took place). Think of a big boulder. Now think of it plopped into the ocean to make an island. What island is it? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Iwa</span>jima (the historical spelling of Iwo Jima).
* Hopefully you know what / where Iwajima is. If not, do a quick history lesson to catch yourself up!
