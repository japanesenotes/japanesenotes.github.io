## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Wolverine</span> ties a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> towel</span> around his <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> forehead</span> and takes out his <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> instead of his claws so he can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sweep</span> the floor clean. When Wolverine fights, his claws are out and he makes a big ol' mess. But once the fighting is done, it's time to get to work and sweep the mess up.
* Picture Wolverine, hair held back with a towel, claws detracted, sweeping up a bar that he just had a big fight in. He's sweeping up broken bottles and broken chairs and broken evil x-men.
* Wolverine knows that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sweep</span>ing is good for the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>). Plus, if you don't help clean up after you defeat bad guys, you're just as bad as them. Sweeping up the mess cleans your soul of any guilt too!
* Sweeping is good for the soul. Sweeping is good for the soul. Sweeping is like chicken soup for the soul.
