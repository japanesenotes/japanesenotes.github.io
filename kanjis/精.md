## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Rice</span> that is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> blue</span> has a strong <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spirit</span>. Our spirits are blue, so if you ever see rice (or other food, or even people) that's blue, you know that's their spirit radiating out!
* Picture this rice, the pulsing blue spirit of each grain is glowing so bright!
* You want to see the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spirit</span> up close, so you take your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sa</span>ber (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せい](https://jisho.org/search/せい)</span>), throw the blue rice in the air, and slice it in half! The rice explodes and blue light fills everything!<br />Then it's gone.
* As you release the spirits in the rice, your saber begins to glow blue too. Their spirits are going inside your saber, making it stronger!
