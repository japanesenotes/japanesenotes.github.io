## Mnemonics
 * How many <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> evenings</span> are there? There are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> many</span>.
* If you accidentally think a lot or something similar, that's okay too. It's the basic meaning that counts, and all these things are pretty close, though eventually you want to get to the point where you know that this kanji does in fact mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> many</span>.
* To remember the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [た](https://jisho.org/search/た)</span> we use the word Taco<br />Let's start with the kanji meaning: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> many</span>. You go outside in the evening (because that's what this kanji is made up of) and are surprised when you're hit by <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> many</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ta</span>cos flying from the sky. For some reason it's raining tacos, and of course you have no idea why.
* The tacos pelt you and knock you off your feet. Hard shell, soft shell, meat, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese... it's terrible. And there are so many of them, flying from the sky to drown you in tacos. This is absolutely absurd (and you should think that too, so you remember the reading).
