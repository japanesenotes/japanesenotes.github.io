## Mnemonics
 * The radical and the meaning of this kanji are the same. Both are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Power</span>.
* If you know the radicals, you should be feeling fine... No, you should feel powerful!
* Who has the most Power of anyone? It's the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Power</span> Rangers. Who are they battling? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ricky the Rock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りき](https://jisho.org/search/りき)</span>, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りょく](https://jisho.org/search/りょく)</span>) Monster.
* Know anyone named <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ricky</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りき](https://jisho.org/search/りき)</span>), even a famous person like Ricky Ricardo or Ricky Gervais? Put his face on the monster the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Power</span> Rangers are fighting. Also, imagine him throwing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rocks</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りょく](https://jisho.org/search/りょく)</span>) and hitting people with them. You should imagine it as more gruesome than Power Rangers was on the show. This is real, yo (and gruesome will help you to remember).
