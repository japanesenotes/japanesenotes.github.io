## Mnemonics
 * If someone has a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> big</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> head</span> you have to try to focus on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> center</span> of it when you talk to them.
* You don't want to get caught with your eyes wandering all over their big head. Stare right at the center of their face. Ah geez, their eyes are kinda far away from here. You can really only see their nose...
* This is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> center</span> of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 王</span>'s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おう](https://jisho.org/search/おう)</span>) head so you have to be extra careful not to look anywhere else.
* The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [王](https://jisho.org/search/王)</span> will definitely cut off your normal-sized head if he sees you looking all over his big head and not at the center.
