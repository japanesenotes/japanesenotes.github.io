## Mnemonics
 * There's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lid</span> on your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> village</span>, so you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> kick</span> it over on its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> backside</span> to see what's on its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> underside</span>.
* You've been curious about what's on the lid (and your village's) backside for years, and you finally can't take it anymore so you kick the lid as hard as you can!
* It turns out your village's own <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> backside</span> is covered in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ura</span>nium (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うら](https://jisho.org/search/うら)</span>). Eureka! You're all gonna be rich!
* Wait, isn't uranium bad for people? This explains why all of the villagers backsides are covered in weird glowing, green lumps.
