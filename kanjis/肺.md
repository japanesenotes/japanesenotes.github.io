## Mnemonics
 * There is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> city</span> inside your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lung</span>. Inside of your lung there is a city and above that city lies a moon. It’s a pretty sight, but also very strange. Moons and cities don’t usually reside inside lungs.
* Imagine having a moon and a city inside your lung. Feel their presence as you breathe in and breathe out. Also, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [月](https://jisho.org/search/月)</span> often refers to internal organs as well, so remember that when you see this kanji.
* Having a moon and city inside your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lung</span> inspires you to write a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hai</span>ku (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はい](https://jisho.org/search/はい)</span>). Perhaps the city and moon are just metaphorical. Either way, a haiku is the best way to go about things here.
* The city and moon<br />Inside my lung, forgotten.<br />Where is the answer?<br />Or just think of your own haiku. Be creative!
