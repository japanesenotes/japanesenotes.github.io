The boundary between your home and your neighbors. The boundary between your town and the next. All you have to do to see it is stand in the dirt. It also helps that there is a boundary sign standing in the dirt that you can also see.
* Get off your computer and go stand outside in the dirt and see what boundaries you can see.

Kyoto is a really famous, important place, so if you think about it, everything could be the boundary between where you are and Kyoto if you just make them really big.
* Picture yourself outside of Kyoto. Picture the boundary between you and Kyoto. Now hop over it!
