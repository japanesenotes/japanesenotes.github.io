## Mnemonics
 * Everyone from your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> clan</span> puts their <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> as a way to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> resist</span> their lords. Your clan is made of a bunch of peasants, but you aren't going to work the land for other people anymore. You're going to resist. This is a protest! Your fingers work for no one but yourselves from now on!
* Imagine your entire clan putting their fingers in the ground in unison as a form of resistance. It's a moving sight.
* You're all <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> resist</span>ing with your fingers in the ground, when the lords appear, angry. You resist us by hiding your fingers with potatoes in the ground?! You want your fingers to be useless potatoes so badly? We'll chop them up and turn them into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ta</span>ter (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てい](https://jisho.org/search/てい)</span>) tots!
* You make your choice to resist. He orders his guards to pull your fingers out of the ground, chop them into the size of tater tots, and then deep fry them. After they're done, the lord pops one in his mouth and says, Oooh, resistance is delicious.
