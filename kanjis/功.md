 * Using your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> construction</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> power</span> you build something great. A true <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> achievement</span> built for the achievement of making kanji learning easier!
* Just constructing this thing was an achievement. Feel proud like it was, well, an achievement.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> achievement</span> was made possible by <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>, so of course this construction project is a giant statue of the man himself. What an achievement of a statue. What an achievement of an achievement.
* Thanks <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち]([こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち)</span>. Now everyone will know of your achievements around kanji learning and inside-out earth theory.<br />Hint: When you see <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [工](https://jisho.org/search/工)</span> in a kanji it will often take the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)</span> reading. Remember that, because it comes up quite a bit!
