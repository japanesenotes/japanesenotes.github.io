## Mnemonics
 * At the top of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mountain</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> signpost</span> to tell you you've reached the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> summit</span>. Literally every mountain that humans have reached the top of has one of these summit signs.
* If that signpost wasn't there how would you know you reached the summit? Like, if you were on top of Everest and there was a bad storm... you'd just topple off the other side. Those summit signposts are important!
* At the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> summit</span>, you decide to build your new <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ho</span>me (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほう](https://jisho.org/search/ほう)</span>). It's been destroyed so many times, and you're sick of it. Maybe if you build you home at the summit of this mountain it will be safer.
* Picture your beautiful summit home. You know, George Washington had one of these too. So. That's cool, I guess.
