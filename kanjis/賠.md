## Mnemonics
 * You give a bunch of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> clown</span> as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> compensation</span>. The clown did you some favors, and everyone knows clowns only accept shellfish as a form of currency. So your compensation is a pile of random shellfish.
* Picture the shellfish in your hands. Imagine handing them over to the clown as compensation for the unspeakable acts you had him do for you.
* Once the clown has been properly <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> compensate</span>d, he looks you in the eyes, one hand full of shellfish, the other in the air, and waves, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Bye</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばい](https://jisho.org/search/ばい)</span>) he says. Bye, bye.
* All you have to do is give him the right amount of compensation and you'll hear his sweet bye, bye. Then you never have to see him again.
