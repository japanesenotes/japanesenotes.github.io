## Mnemonics
 * Throw a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span> in a cage with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tiger</span> and some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spikes</span> and the tiger will have the time of its life <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> play</span>ing with them! Think of all the tiger play time possibilities! 
* If you were the tiger how would you play with the drunkard? 
* If you aren't the tiger, watching it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> play</span> is a little like watching someone's head get cut off with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gui</span>llotine (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎ](https://jisho.org/search/ぎ)</span>). In fact, you don't want to watch it play at all anymore.
* What would you rather watch? A guillotine at work or a tiger playing like this?
