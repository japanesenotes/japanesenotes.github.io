## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> genius</span> immediately becomes <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lumber</span>. They can look at the tree and see more: the ability to turn it into lumber into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> material</span> and use it for a million different things.
* Picture the genius staring at a large tree. Math symbols and equations fly around in their head, until finally a little lightbulb and a pile of lumber appear above their head.
* This genius doesn't want to use the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lumber</span> to build a house or a chair, no no, they're going to use these <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> material</span>s to build a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> xy</span>lophone (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ざい](https://jisho.org/search/ざい)</span>)! The most difficult instrument to create!!
* Watch as the tree becomes lumber and that lumber is used to craft a ginormous xylophone. Each key is its own plank of lumber!
