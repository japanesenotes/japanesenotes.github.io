* You’ve got not one <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tumor</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つま](https://jisho.org/search/つま)</span>), but <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> too ma</span>ny (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つめ](https://jisho.org/search/つめ)</span>) tumors and you need to claw them out with your sharp <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> claw</span>. One tumor is one tumor too many. Cut them out with your claw!
* Imagine you have too many tumors. Feel the claw digging into your flesh and removing the tumors. It really hurts, but it is necessary.
