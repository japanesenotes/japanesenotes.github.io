## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Flowers</span> can be used for <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> comfort</span>, but also for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> medicine</span>. Sure, it’s a comfort to smell flowers because they smell nice, but one can also use them as medicine to heal people.
* Imagine having some medicine that smells and tastes like fresh cut flowers. Smell the smell in your nose and taste the taste on your tongue.
* The best way to transport all the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> medicine</span> on land is with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yak</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [やく](https://jisho.org/search/やく)</span>). Yaks are big, strong, and very capable of transporting flower medicine like these.
* Picture a yak in your mind. Pretend you are riding atop the yak as it transports this medicine. Feel the fur of the yak in your hands as you cling on for dear life.
