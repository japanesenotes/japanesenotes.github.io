## Mnemonics
 * Behind the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span> lies a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mask</span>—yet another <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> layer</span> of secrecy. You’re standing in front of a crowd, giving a rousing speech. Hiding your face is the flag of your country, and behind that flag you’re also wearing a mask, just in case the flag falls down. The extra layer of secrecy is just to be safe.
* These layers are meant to protect you. We all have layers we hide behind sometimes, you know? You can't be totally transparent with everyone.
* Someone jumps up on stage and starts peeling off your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> layer</span>s! You stand there, first goes the flag, then the mask, then ... your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>) is laid bare. No, literally. You don't have a body, your soul was under that mask. And now it's floating there for all to see.
* Everyone in the crowd is completely silent, staring at your soul, with all of its layers peeled off.
