## Mnemonics
 * Killing two <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span>s with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> jackhammer</span> is expressly <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prohibit</span>ed. Don't get me wrong, you can rip up one tree with your jackhammer, but not two.
* Imagine standing in front a forest with your jackhammer, staring at a sign with just this kanji on it. Tree plus tree with jackhammer equals prohibited. Hmm.
* The person who decided to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prohibit</span> jackhammering two trees is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kin</span>g (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きん](https://jisho.org/search/きん)</span>) of England. He's the only person who's able to prohibit certain things, so it had to be him.
* Picture the King angrily covering his ears as his subjects jackhammer trees. He screams and shouts, his crown bouncing on his head, and points at his new sign that prohibits the jackhammering of trees.
