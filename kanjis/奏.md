## Mnemonics
 * When it's <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spring</span> in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heaven</span> they <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> play music</span>. To your mortal, human ears it sounds more like snow melting, birds chirping, and plants waking up.
* Close your eyes and imagine all of the spring sounds that come down to you from heaven in the springtime. Mmm, you can almost smell the damp soil and rain.
* In heaven, the ones that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> play music</span> are the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>ls (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>) of the dead. They have a huge band up there, and even though it just seems like normal spring sounds to you, up there in heaven when the souls play music it's more like a huge, 100-part band!
* Picture all of the souls in heaven playing spring music together!
