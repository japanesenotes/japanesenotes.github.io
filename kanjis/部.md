## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> clown</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span> is over in that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> part</span> of town. We keep the clown part as separate as we can from the rest of the normal people. In fact, the entire clown education <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> department</span> and their clown <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> club</span>s have to stay in their part, they can't come in ours.
* Of course, we feel terrible about forcing the clowns into their own part of town. It's not that they're lesser than us, it's just that we don't like them.
* You see, that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> part</span> of town is full of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boo</span>ze (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶ](https://jisho.org/search/ぶ)</span>). Clowns need a lot of booze to keep their charade going, so we just let them have it. But they aren't allowed in our part anymore, because they all stink of nasty clown booze.
* Picture all of the clowns, trapped in their weird clown part of town, drinking booze and smashing each other over the heads with the bottles. You're glad you don't live in that part.
