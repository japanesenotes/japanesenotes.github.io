## Mnemonics
 * Put your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ear</span>s when there's an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> explosion</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> in addition</span> to all the other things you were told to do. You have to crouch under a desk, you have to stay away from windows, you have to close your eyes. But in addition to that, you need to protect your ears!
* Pretend you're in a class in the mid-20th century, watching a video on bomb explosion safety. In addition to putting your fingers in your ears, you have to do a bunch of other stuff. You can't just stop after the first step!
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> In addition</span> to all the steps you have to take to protect yourself, you can't forget that ears come in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sets</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せつ](https://jisho.org/search/せつ)</span>). You can't just stick one finger in one ear and have that be the end. You have a set of ears to worry about!
* In addition to ears, you have a lot of sets on your body to worry about. Sets of eyes, nostrils, legs, you get the picture.
