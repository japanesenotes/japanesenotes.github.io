## Mnemonics
 * There are some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span> in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> front</span> of you. When you try to move, they always rotate around with you, staying right in front. You can't escape these objects, for some reason.<br />This kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> before</span> too. Something that's in front of you is before you, after all.
* Perhaps it's some kind of magic, but you don't care. Why are these strange objects always in front of me? Why won't they stay put? This will get pretty freaky after a while. Try to run. Try to hide. Spin around. Do whatever you need to do. No matter what, these objects are always in front.
* You're going crazy with these things in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> front</span> of you all the time. You finally seek the help of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Zen</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぜん](https://jisho.org/search/ぜん)</span>) master, who tells you that meditation will save you from this curse. You try it out, and sure enough, the objects are gone! It worked!
* Go ahead and do some Zen Buddhist meditation. Maybe it'll help you to remember this kanji's reading better (and calm your mind so you're ready for the next kanji!).
