## Mnemonics
 * This is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> boat</span>, but it's missing some pieces. That's because it's really rusty, so parts are falling off of it and it looks <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rust colored</span>. It's getting more and more rusty as time goes on.
* Picture this broken, rust colored boat. It's a reddish-brown color and it's definitely missing some important pieces.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rust colored</span> boat has inspired you, so you sit down next to it in the sun and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たん](https://jisho.org/search/たん)</span>). You want to be the exact same rust color as the boat, and in a few hours you're sure you'll match.
* Watch your skin slowly change as you tan to match the rust colored boat. Feel your skin in the sun. This may not be good for your health, but it's great for fashion!
