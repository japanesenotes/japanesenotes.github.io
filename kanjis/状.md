## Mnemonics
 * There's an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> icicle</span> on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dog</span>. That is the dog's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> condition</span>.
* Imagine a couple police officers looking at the dog, talking specifically about the condition they found the dog in.
* The frozen <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> condition</span> of this dog was caused by <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Jou</span>rm (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょう](https://jisho.org/search/じょう)</span>), the local farmhand. He forgot to let the dog back inside, and then it froze.
* But, did Jourm forget? We all know he's a bit clumsy and slow, but he's been letting the dog inside for years now. Would he really do this by accident? That's what the police seem to think, despite the condition they found the dog in.
