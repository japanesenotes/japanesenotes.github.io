## Mnemonics
 * Does the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bamboo</span> shirt <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> suit</span> me? you ask... but nobody will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> answer</span>.
* Shout PLEASE ANSWER ME! a few times to get the idea of answer in your head. What you really want is an answer, whether it's bad or good, but nobody's willing to say anything because you look so terrible.
* So, instead of a shirt now, you try something else. Maybe a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coat</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こた](https://jisho.org/search/こた)</span>) will get you an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> answer</span>.
* You put on this weird bamboo coat. Smell it and feel the texture. How is it? Probably a bit bulky.
