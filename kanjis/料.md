## Mnemonics
 * You have a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ladle</span> that's specifically for paying the rice <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fee</span>. Each scoop of something has an extra fee tacked on, so when you use a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> material</span>, there's a fee you have to pay in that material as well.
* Imagine ladling up a nice big scoop of rice and then seeing the little fee ladle next to it. Ugh. The material fee.
* One day, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fee</span> ladle is suddenly the size of row (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りょう](https://jisho.org/search/りょう)</span>) boat oars! What! You're supposed to pay a row boat sized fee now?!
* That's a lot of material you have to give up every time you want to eat some rice. Maybe you should take this row boat oar ladle and row out into the ocean where no one can tax you.
