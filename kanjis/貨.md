## Mnemonics
 * You want to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> change</span> your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> freight</span> so you can transport it. That means packing them up into giant freight containers.
* Imagine changing your shellfish from loose, wet form, to solid freight form. It's actually a lot of hard work.
* To move this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> freight</span>, you need a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>). You strap all of the freight containers to the top of your car, stacked nice and high and precarious, so you can move it.
* Picture all of this freight stacked on top of your car. As you drive the car, every turn you make feels slow and heavy from the freight weight.
