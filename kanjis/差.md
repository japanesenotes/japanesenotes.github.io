## Mnemonics
 * When the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span> of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span> down into the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> construction</span> below he loses <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> distinction</span>. Now the king just looks like everyone else, there's nothing that sets him apart!
* The king's distinction is gone. He isn't special, he isn't different. Without his horns he's like the rest of you plebs.
* The king wants his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> distinction</span> back so he runs down into the construction site just in time to see his horns getting cut into bits by a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> saw</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)</span>).
* I guess the construction worker couldn't distinguish between what he was supposed to saw and the king's horns.
