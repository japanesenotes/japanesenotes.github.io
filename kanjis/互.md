## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shuriken</span> have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mutual</span> respect for one another. The shuriken respects the ground because of how solid and stable it is, and the ground respects the shuriken for how pointy it is. They have great mutual respect here.
* Pick up the shuriken and throw it into the ground. Hear it whizz through the air and then plunk into the ground. This act of aggression causes their mutual respect to waver.
* Since you made the shuriken attack the ground, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mutual</span> respect is out of balance. This summons <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Go</span>dzilla (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ご](https://jisho.org/search/ご)</span>) up from the depths of the ocean once more. He always shows up when something is out of wack, to show humans the error of their ways. He picks up the shuriken and flings it into a city, which explodes, leaving a crater in the ground.
* You give Godzilla a thumbs up, you see what he's trying to do. He looks down at you and nods. Now you have a mutual respect for one another too.
