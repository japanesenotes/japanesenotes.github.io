 * You <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lack</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ice</span>. So you go to the store and see if they have any. Nope, no ice. So, now you go to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> next</span> store. Is there ice here? Nope. Next!
* Feel a little frustrated you can't find ice. Have the words <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> next</span> next next echoing through your head as you go from store to store, irritated.

He comes down from the heavens with ice in his hands.
