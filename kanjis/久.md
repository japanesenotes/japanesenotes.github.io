## Mnemonics
 * If you get caught and thrown down the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> prison</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span>, you'll be sliding for a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> long time</span>.
* Imagine a never-ending prison slide. You can't see anything in the dark around you, you just plunge down and slide forever. And forever is a long time, my friend.
* Your captors want you to slide for a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> long time</span>, so they can't have you dying of hunger. So every once in a while a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cu</span>cumber (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きゅう](https://jisho.org/search/きゅう)</span>) comes tumbling down the slide next to you.
* Cucumbers are tasty, but not when you've been eating them for a long time.
