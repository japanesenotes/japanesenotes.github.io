## Mnemonics
 * Take <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> three</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> measurement</span>s of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gold</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span> them into a mold to make a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cast</span>! You'll have cast three gold swords, or goblets, or ducks. Just make sure you follow those directions, or your casting won't come out right.
* Imagine yourself carefully measuring out the three portions of gold and sliding them into your mold to make a cast of whatever you want. I wonder what it could be?
* You open the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cast</span> to reveal your gold statue of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chew</span>bacca (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちゅう)](https://jisho.org/search/ちゅう))</span>! It's life-size and now you have three! Your new gold Chewbacca casts are going to guard the entrance to your house.
* Picture your majestic Chewbacca casts. Carefully set them outside your front door to guard you. This was a great idea!
