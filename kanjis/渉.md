## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> is coming, and you want to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> walk</span> over it, so you have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ford</span> it. Think about it – you ford a river, you ford anything that’s water, unless you’re Jesus – you’re not Jesus. You don’t walk across a tsunami, you ford it.
* Imaging taking your shoes off, hiking up your pants, and holding all of your things above your head as you ford across the tsunami.
* Your ability to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ford</span> this tsunami impresses everyone who witnesses it, especially the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>). Now that you've taught him a tsunami can be forded, he's going to start sending his troops through them instead of waiting for them to pass.
* Your new fording techniques have increased the Shougun's military power! Congrats, I guess.
