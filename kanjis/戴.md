## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> carrying <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span> wants you to go to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> together</span> so you can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> receive</span> something from them.
* You really don't want to receive whatever it is this drunkard wants to give you, and it's even sketchier that they want you to go to a rice paddy together to do it.
* Against your better judgement, you decided to go and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> receive</span> the thing. You close your eyes, hold out your hands, and feel a silky, light <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tie</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たい](https://jisho.org/search/たい)</span>) being placed in them.
* The tie looks harmless enough, but you still receive it skeptically. The drunkard is just holding up his cross and smiling at you. Hmm.
