## Mnemonics
 * Your new <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> car</span> doesn’t <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mix</span> well with the other cars in your garage because its color is in stark <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> contrast</span> to the others. All of your other cars are pristine white in color, but this new car is a mix of lots of colors. It almost looks like a peacock or something it’s so colorful. Such a contrast.
* Imagine this garage of yours with a sea of white cars. Now there is a new car that really sticks out like a sore thumb. Imagine yourself looking out over your cars and seeing this wacky car practically jumping out at you.
* What did I say this car looks like? Oh that’s right, a pea<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かく](https://jisho.org/search/かく)</span>). This car looks like a peacock. It’s the color of a peacock and you’ll look like you’re peacocking when you’re out on the town driving it. It really is such a stark <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> contrast</span> to like, every other car out there.
* See yourself driving around in this peacock car. Hear the engine purr as strangers jeer and yell at you. This car sure does get a lot of attention, doesn’t it?
