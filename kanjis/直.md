## Mnemonics
 * You accidentally stab your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> into the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eye</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lion</span>. This is a terrible thing you did and you need to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fix</span> it right now. I'll be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> direct</span> with you, this is something you have to fix on your own.
* How will you fix this mistake though? Maybe if you build a time machine you can go back and stop yourself from throwing your cross around so carelessly. Whatever you do, focus on how important it is to fix the mistake, more than anything.
* As you try to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fix</span> the lion's eye, it starts to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> choke</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょく](https://jisho.org/search/ちょく)</span>) and make what can only be described as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> jiki</span>jikijiki sound (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じき](https://jisho.org/search/じき)</span>). Through its choking jikijiki sounds, it coughs up a gear. Wait. Is this a machine lion?
* You're relieved! You don't know how to fix a choking, eye-stabbed lion, but you can absolutely fix a ROBOTIC one. Robots are fixable.
