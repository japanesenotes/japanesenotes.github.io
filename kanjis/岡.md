## Mnemonics
 * Hill = mountain with some kind of lid, decreased mountain.<br><br>You have a scene going on inside your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> head</span>. It is of a pair of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> atop a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mountain</span>. No. It is not just one pair of horns. It is many. So many that they create a giant <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hill</span> atop the mountain, which is already pretty high.
* Imagine this hill of horns on top of this mountain. This hill of horns makes it possible for you to get just high enough to touch the top of the sky.
* How was standing atop this hill of horns on top of a mountain to touch the sky? Eh. It was <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> oka</span>y (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おか](https://jisho.org/search/おか)</span>), but that's about it.
* Feel indifferent about this hill of horns on top of the mountain. It's all in your head anyways.
