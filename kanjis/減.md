## Mnemonics
 * When a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> comes, your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> feeling</span>s <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> decrease</span>.
* This works both ways:<br />Your feelings decrease so that you feel less, and can recover from the tsunami faster.<br />Or!<br />Your feelings decrease, in that they go down, so they get really low and terrible and sad because tsunamis are devastating.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> decrease</span> in feelings from the terrible tsunami hits <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Gen</span>ji (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [げん](https://jisho.org/search/げん)</span>) the hardest. He's a very emotional man, so he usually feels things very strongly. When tsunami hit, well, his feelings decrease to nothing. 
* Picture Genji, his feelings decrease down, down, down, until he's just a sad, beautiful shell of a person.
