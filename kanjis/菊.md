## Mnemonics
 * If you pick certain <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice</span> or <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> you'll be put in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> prison</span>. The most famous of these is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chrysanthemum</span>. Chrysanthemums are super important in Japan because they're the symbol of the imperial family. They're even on the cover of Japanese passports. If you get caught picking a chrysanthemum, you're going to prison.
* Chrysanthemums are really important to the Japanese people. Please don't ever pick them (or rice, because that's stealing food, someone planted that)!
* If you go to prison for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chrysanthemum</span> picking, everyone in the prison is going to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kick</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きく](https://jisho.org/search/きく)</span>) you nonstop. You broke the chrysanthemum picking law, so kicking is your punishment. And believe me, you don't want these kicks.
* Imagine holding a chrysanthemum in your hands while you get kicked over and over and over in prison. Was it worth it?
