## Mnemonics
 * If someone makes a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bamboo</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horse</span>, you know it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deliberate</span>. You can't accidentally make an entire horse out of bamboo.
* Someone sat down and deliberately planned the entire horse out, collected the materials, and made it by hand.
* As you admire all the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deliberate</span> details in this bamboo horse, the ghost of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Toku</span>gawa (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とく](https://jisho.org/search/とく)</span>) Ieyasu appears before you! I deliberately made this horse to show you how important being deliberate is. You should be absolutely certain and decisive about your decisions.
* Tokugawa Ieyasu then poofs out of existence and so does the bamboo horse.
