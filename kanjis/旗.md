## Mnemonics
 * Traveling in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> direction</span> of the ocean, you take a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gun</span> and shoot a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> crab</span>, then stick a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flag</span> in the beach and claim it as your own. The crab was the only thing standing in the way of you conquering the area. Now that the flag is in the ground, no one can dispute who it belongs to.
* Look at your flag and hear it flapping in the wind. Also hear your ears ringing a bit from when you shot that crab. Look at all the bits of exploded crab strewn around the area. Yowza.
* To make sure that no one removes your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flag</span>, you lock it to one of the lifeguard posts and you throw away the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>). Since no one will have the key to unlock the flag, no one will be able to remove it.
* Picture yourself locking this flag up with your key. Imagine turning the key in the lock and hearing the click when it is secured.
