## Mnemonics
 * In your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> weapon</span>, so you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> throw</span> it. Maybe you're angry and you threw the weapon at a person you don't like. Maybe you're a pacifist and you threw it away so no one else could use it. Either way, when you have a weapon in your fingers you have to throw it.
* Imagine a weapon in between your fingers. It doesn't matter what kind. Now feel the weight as you throw it.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> throw</span> your weapon away because you're about to enter <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> とうきょう</span> and there are no weapons allowed there. There is, however, a big pile of thrown away weapons by the border, which is where you're throwing yours right now.
* Imagine throwing the weapon in your fingers just before you walk into <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span>. You can see the lights, smell the smells! Throw your weapons and your cares away!
