## Mnemonics
 * Take some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> water and sacrifice the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> life</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> to make a liquid you can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pickle</span> in. All pickling liquids are made from 1 part tsunami and 1 part murdered shellfish.
* Imagine stabbing a shellfish and dropping it in some water you collected from a tsunami so that you can make your own pickles.
* You can only <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pickle</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>) things with the life of one shellfish. Thats a lot of dead critters for not a lot of delicious pickles. Make sure you get a lot of shellfish if you want a full jar.
* Picture the two pickles that shellfish life got you. They're gonna be the best pickles ever!
