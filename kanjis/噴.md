## Mnemonics
 * From your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> comes a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span>, some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span>, and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span>. It all <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> erupt</span>s from your mouth!
* Imagine these three things coming out of your mouth not one at a time, but all together like an eruption. Perhaps you're laying on your back, and they burst out of your mouth.
* When do inanimate objects <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> erupt</span> from your mouth? Mostly when you're having <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fun</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふん](https://jisho.org/search/ふん)</span>).
* It's really inconvenient that things erupt from your mouth whenever you're having fun. Makes it hard to have fun.
