## Mnemonics
 * You see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gate</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> growing through it and it reminds you that you need more <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> leisure</span> time. You walk up to the gate tree and curl up under its branches. No one will bother you because the tree is blocking the gate from being used.
* Imagine spending your leisure time curled up under a tree that's growing through a gate. It's so cozy and secluded!
* As you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> leisure</span>ly nap, you hear a gruff voice, Ah, you're done too, huh? It's Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>)! He's spending his leisure time relaxing under this abandoned gate just like you.
* But wait. Isn't Genghis Khan dead now? He winks at you, Leisure time is for the dead. He smiles, and fades away, disappearing into the tree.
