## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> you're holding above your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> head</span> to keep your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dry</span> keeps pulling you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> south</span>. Probably because it's warmer and less damp down south.
* Look down and see the compass pointing south and feel the cross pulling you in that direction.
* You finally make it down <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> south</span>, and it is dry, but you're really hungry. When you try to find southern food you realize every single store is only selling <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> naan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なん](https://jisho.org/search/なん)</span>).
* Imagine being in the south and taking big bites of naan. It tastes good, but now your mouth is dry just like your horns. Too dry...
