## Mnemonics
 * A magic <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> fell from the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> onto the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hundred</span> people, causing him to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shrink</span>!
* Picture one hundred people under the same roof watching in horror as their leader suddenly shrinks to nothingness before them.
* As the leader <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shrink</span>s, the hundred people start screaming and running around the entire place. As a result, everything is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shook</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅく](https://jisho.org/search/しゅく)</span>) up. Especially the poor, shrunken leader, who gets knocked around the most.
* The leader gets shook so badly, he can't even call out to his people. They're going to trample his tiny, shrinking body!
