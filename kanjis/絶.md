## Mnemonics
 * Sometime in the future, <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> of every <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> color</span> will be faced with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> extinction</span>. Eventually there will be nothing else to make thread out of, and thread of every kind and color will reach extinction.
* Imagine what the world would be like without thread. No thread of any color. How would you fix tears in clothes or make new ones? It would be a strange world where thread is extinct.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> extinction</span> of thread was brought on by a very strange thing. Deadly <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> zits</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぜつ](https://jisho.org/search/ぜつ)</span>). These zits killed off all the producers of thread, and eventually the thread went extinct. Dang zits.
* Pretend you have deadly zits. They’re everywhere, not just your face. You can’t pop them or you’ll die, but they’re all bulging and extremely painful. Now you’re facing extinction. Lousy.
