## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> wave</span> crashes into a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> woman</span>, transforming her into an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> old woman</span>! The wave washes away all of the woman’s makeup, revealing her to be an old woman. The makeup she had on made her appear to be a much younger woman, but once the wave washed away her makeup, she was revealed for the old woman she is.
* Imagine a gorgeous woman. Now see her get hit by a wave of water and turn into an old woman. The old woman could still be pretty too, she just looks way old now. Like ancient.
* In an attempt to distract you from the fact that she is actually an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> old woman</span>, the old woman starts to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> baa</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ば](https://jisho.org/search/ば)</span>) and act like a sheep. The old woman goes “Baa! Baa!” and hops around on all fours like a sheep.
* Imagine this old woman acting like a sheep, just saying “baa” over and over and over again. Baa! Baa! Baa!
