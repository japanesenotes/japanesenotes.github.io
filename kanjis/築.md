## Mnemonics
 * You <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> saw</span> down a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bamboo</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> construct</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> build</span> a building. Bamboo trees are great for construction, so you saw down a bunch of bamboo trees to build this new building.
* Imagine yourself sawing down this bamboo tree. Feel the saw in your hands as you slide through the bamboo, wood chips flying everywhere.
* As you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> construct</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> build</span> this building, you hear a strange cheeping noise. Suddenly a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chick</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちく](https://jisho.org/search/ちく)</span>) pops out of one of the bamboo pieces you are building with. Then another, and another. You're surrounded by chicks!
* Imagine trying to construct the rest of this building covered in baby chicks. They're very cute, but this is dangerous! You have to build very carefully, so you don't accidentally hurt any of them.
