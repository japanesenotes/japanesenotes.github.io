## Mnemonics
 * In the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span>, the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> woman</span> has to go through all the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> count</span> each individual grain. Once she's counted all of them, she'll have an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> amount</span> / <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> number</span> so that she can split them up accordingly.
* She has to count each grain out in order to divvy up the supply to last through the winter. Imagine yourself getting just a few grains today for food. It's not a good time for you guys :(
* Why are you so low on rice? It's because someone <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue</span>d your farm and took everything you owned. So, you had barely enough rice (or not enough).
* Come up with a story about why your farm got sued for everything. Go to the court  case. Listen to the judge come up with your verdict. Be angry. This has ruined everything.
