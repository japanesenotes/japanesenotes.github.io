## Mnemonics
 * There's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> root</span> where your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fang</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> previously</span> was. Your fang isn't there anymore, you ripped it out.
* Look at the root where your fang previously was. Previously, when you were young, you had a lot of nice fangs but they're all rotting as you get older and you pull them out.
* To remember the beautiful fangs you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> previously</span> had, you keep all of the ones you pull out in a box you lock with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>).
* Previously you didn't have a key, but now you do to keep your old fangs safe.
