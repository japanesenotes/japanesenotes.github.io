## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span> wants you to make a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rocket</span> that looks <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> glassy</span>. It won't be very stable, and it probably won't work, but making it glassy and pretty is the only way to make the king will approve.
* Imagine a king who won't accept a rocket that isn't made of glassy material. He's not very smart...
* You take the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> glassy</span> rocket and try to stuff some thin <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reed</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [り](https://jisho.org/search/り)</span>) inside to support it. But because it's clear and glassy the king sees them at the last second.
* Picture the king admiring himself in the glassy surface and then his face contorts. He smashes his fist through the rocket and rips out the reeds. REEDS AREN'T GLASSY! he cries, and starts hitting you with them.
