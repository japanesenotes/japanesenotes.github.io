## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Compare</span> the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> – these two things don’t <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mix</span>. If a tsunami is coming, it will likely get in the way of the sun.
* Imagine the sun getting blocked out as a tsunami rises up from the ocean. Feel the cold fear of death on you as the tsunami approaches. That tsunami is gonna mix you up.
* Just before the tsunami crashes over you, a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> con</span>dor (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こん](https://jisho.org/search/こん)</span>) swoops out of the sky and grabs you up. This condor must be a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mix</span> – a normal condor is not strong enough to pick up a human. The condor must be mixed with something else. Like a pterodactyl.
* Imagine yourself getting mixed up in this situation and the pterodactyl sized condor picking you up. Feel the condor’s talons digging into your shoulders as it grabs you up and flies you towards the sun.
