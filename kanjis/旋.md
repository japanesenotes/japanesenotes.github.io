## Mnemonics
 * Move your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> coat rack</span> in one <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> direction</span> by shooting it with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gun</span>. Then you can keep shooting it to get a good <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rotation</span> going. If you think there is a better way to make your coat rack make <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> revolution</span>s, you're probably wrong. 
* Imagine getting your coat rack to make rotations in a circle just by shooting it with a gun!
* As you watch your coat rack's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rotation</span>s a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cen</span>taur (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span>) barges in and takes the gun from you, stops the rotating coat rack and leaves. How rude! I guess centaurs don't like when things rotate.
* Picture that centaurs angry face. Convince yourself it was the rotation it didn't like.
