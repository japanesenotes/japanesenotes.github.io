## Mnemonics
 * You count <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> nine</span> of them in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span>, each <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> holding something <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> random</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> miscellaneous</span>. There are nine turkeys in the tree and they’re all holding random, miscellaneous things. How odd.
* Look at the turkeys in the tree. There are nine of them and they are all gobbling up a storm. Hear them gobble as you imagine what random, miscellaneous things they are holding.
* As if things couldn’t get any more <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> random</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Zazu</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ざつ](https://jisho.org/search/ざつ)</span>) from the Lion King flies into the tree and starts asking the nine turkeys <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> miscellaneous</span> trivia. Zazu always did have a thirst for knowledge, but this is kind of strange.
* Look at Zazu asking the turkeys random questions about miscellaneous trivia. You’ve seen the Lion King, right? Zazu should be pretty easy to visualize here.
