## Mnemonics
 * In a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> on <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> nine</span> branches are some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> frame</span>s. Each cross frame is hung on the branches of the tree. You don’t know who decided to hang the frames there, but you think it might be some new wave art or something. Actually you need a frame, and there are already nine up there, so you decide to take one.
* Feel the tree bark under your palms as you climb up the tree to take a frame. You get a splinter from grabbing the frame. It really smarts.
* The cross shaped <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> frame</span> you took has a picture of the American rapper <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Waka</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わく](https://jisho.org/search/わく)</span>) Flocka in it. If you don’t know who Waka is, take the time to YouTube a song of his to get the Waka beat flowin’ through your body.
* Look at the picture of Waka Flocka as you imagine the sound of his groovy tunes. It almost makes you forget how painful that frame splinter you got is. Almost.
