## Mnemonics
 * The&nbsp;<strong>thick</strong>&nbsp;cliff&nbsp;walls protected the child&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<em>sun</em>.<br><br>Hanging off the edge of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cliff</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> worshipping <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> child</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thick</span> unibrow. Hanging off the cliff, the child cries at the sun for cursing him to this cruel fate. Even the thickness of his unibrow is not enough to give the child the strength to pull himself back up.
* I mean, this unibrow is really, really thick. So thick it doesn’t even look real. But it is. It’s really real and really thick.
* The child's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thick</span> unibrow can't wait any longer and gives up. It hops off the child's face and says, Hey dude, I'll be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> at Sue's</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あつ](https://jisho.org/search/あつ)</span>). She'll appreciate my thick, luxuriousness more than a weakling like you.
* I guess if you want to go see that thick, beautiful unibrow you'll have to go see it at Sue's now. What's that? Oh, don't worry about the child. It uh. It's probably at Sue's too! Maybe... (or dead).
