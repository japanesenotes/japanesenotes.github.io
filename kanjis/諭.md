## Mnemonics
 * If you try to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> something to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Death Star</span>, it would only <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> admonish</span> you. It was made to destroy planets, after all, so I don't know why you'd expect it to have anything nice to say. It just admonishes you about everything you've ever done wrong until you can't stop crying.
* Imagine being admonished by the Death Star. It's hovering above you, giant and round, just yelling at you about everything you've ever messed up. It's really awful being yelled at. But the Death Star doing it is particularly scary and embarrassing.
* Right now you're being <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> admonish</span>ed about living in a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yu</span>rt (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆ](https://jisho.org/search/ゆ)</span>). The Death Star bellows, What, am I too big and safe for you? I'm easy to move too, you know. You're a disgrace! You should be ashamed!
* Imagine sitting in your yurt, the home you love, but you can still hear the admonishments from the Death Star in your ears. You feel... bad.
