## Mnemonics
 * Make your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> barracks</span> out of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> so it will be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pure</span>. If you build it out of clay or bricks or wood, it will inevitably have some dirt in it. Build it out of thread to keep it pure of... well, impurities.
* Imagine a barracks pure white, like pure snow, made of pure thread.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pure</span> thread barracks can only be used in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> June</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゅん](https://jisho.org/search/じゅん)</span>), unfortunately. Any other time of year there will be snow and rain and mud and that will get tracked into the pure barracks and ruin them. But June is the cleanest, most pure month, so you can use it then.
* Okay, so maybe building a pure barracks that you can only use in June was a bad idea, but it's there now and I don't want you getting it dirty, so just use it when I say so, okay?
