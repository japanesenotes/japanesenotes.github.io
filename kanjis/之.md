## Mnemonics
 * How do you make a mnemonic for the word this? You don’t. But, we can try. You climb many <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hill</span>s. On top of one of the hills is a little <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> of water. You pick it up and say “<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> THIS</span>… THIS IS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR!”
* As you look at the drop of water, you note that you found the right thing. Written on it is the word “this.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> This</span> particular drop of water hold the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> core</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [これ](https://jisho.org/search/これ)</span>) of the universe. If you didn't find this very droplet, we all would have died and this universe would be gone.
* The core of the universe is in this drop of water. Or is it in this mnemonic? Ooohhhhh you'll never knoooowwww!
