## Mnemonics
 * If there's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> treasure chest</span>, there's always a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> villain</span> too. The villian is trying to get to the treasure chest before the hero of the story.
* And the villain always gets to the treasure chest first, often via nefarious means. That villain is SO important when it comes to treasure chests.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> villain</span> beat you all the way to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> きょうと</span> to get this particular treasure chest. 
* Arrrg! If only you had been closer to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょうと](https://jisho.org/search/きょうと)</span>! Then you might have beaten this dastardly villain.
