## Mnemonics
 * When under<span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> music</span> makes it out into the light of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> (the public), it finally becomes <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> official</span>. Music isn't really real unless people hear it outside of those secret underground concerts.
* Think of all that music you listened to underground but not in the light of the sun. None of that was official music. None of it!
* Once the music is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> official</span>, you'll feel it in your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>). When you listen to it outside, under the bright sun, your soul gets to finally hear it too.
* The official music penetrates into your soul, instead of just your ears, and it's affecting everyone else's souls too! Oh no... wait that's too many people. This was your song! No, it's too popular now, stop your souls from liking it! Ahhh!
