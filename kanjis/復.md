## Mnemonics
 * You <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> loiter</span> around a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> black hole</span>, waiting for it to finish destroying and switch to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> restore</span> mode. You were told all black holes finish eventually, and when they do you can press a button to restore everything back to the way it was.
* Imagine loitering around near (but not too near!) the black hole waiting for it finish so you can restore the galaxy.
* Finally there's nothing else for the black hole to eat so you hit the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> restore</span> button.... but nothing happens. Oh <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> f**k</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふく](https://jisho.org/search/ふく)</span>) you! you scream as you realize you were lied to.
* Maybe if you yell f**k you enough things will be restored. Ha. No. Everything's gone and it's your fault for being gullible.
