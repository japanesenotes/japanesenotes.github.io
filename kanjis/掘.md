## Mnemonics
 * You see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span> near the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> exit</span>, so you use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dig</span> there. Most flags mark something, and this exit is pretty obvious, so there must be something under here. At least that's what you think to yourself as you dig.
* Imagine digging under the flag by the exit of your building with your bare fingers. The dirt is getting under your fingernails as you dig. It's getting on your knees. It's everywhere.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dig</span> until you finally hit something. It's a bunch of buried old <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coots</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くつ](https://jisho.org/search/くつ)</span>). They're in an underground room for old coots. One yells up at you, Whatcha doing to our roof, ya whipper snapper?! Stop digging in our lawn!
* You carefully un-dig the old coots and leave them to their old grumpy coot hole... basement... secret clubhouse? Whatever.
