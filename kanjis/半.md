## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> triceratops</span> is laying out to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dry</span>. But it's so big, and it's laying on its side, so only <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> half</span> of it gets dry.
* Imagine the triceratops on its side, then imagine it getting up. When it stands up normally, half of its body is soaking wet still. It's a half-n-half triceratops right now.
* You're half wet and half dry! I will cut you in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> half</span> with my laser blaster so you're proper again, a voice says. It is  <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Han</span> Solo (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はん](https://jisho.org/search/はん)</span>), the anti-establishment guy who hates when things aren't even.
* Imagine him using his blaster to shoot the poor triceratops in half, perfectly down the wet-dry line of its body.
