The thread gets so overgrown that you can’t even walk through it without cutting the thread down with a machete.
* Imagine trying to wade through this overgrown field of thread. It’s really difficult, and also it’s really cold because it’s winter. You shiver. Imagine chopping the thread down with your machete. Chop chop chop!
* The reason this field of thread got so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> overgrown</span> is because you’re <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Han</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はん](https://jisho.org/search/はん)</span>) Solo and you’re not used to simple things like farming thread.
