## Mnemonics
 * When you meet the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dog</span> you have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bow</span> to show your respect. Dogs are pretty great, so the leader of all dogs must be the greatest! You should bow really deeply to this one.
* Picture yourself bowing to the leader dog. Leader dog is so cool!
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bow</span> as low as you can, but you lose your balance and fall over. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> F**k</span> you (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふく](https://jisho.org/search/ふく)</span>)! the leader dog barks. Oh no. You messed up and now the leader dog is super mad. Saying f**k you is a little harsh for falling over though, you think.
* Bow even deeper as the dog leader keeps barking what sounds like f**k you. You're pretty sure that's what he's saying at least... but maybe... maybe it's not.
