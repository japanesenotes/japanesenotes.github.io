## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> husband</span> marries a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> husband</span> while the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> goes down and the men <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> replace</span> their solitary lives with one of everlasting companionship. Instead of one husband and one wife, we have two husbands here. They shed their lives of bachelorhood and replace it with one of monogamy.
* See these two husbands as the sun sets under them. Listen to them each saying their vows, expressing how they could never replace one another.
* After the ceremony, the husband and his husband get in a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>) and drive off into the sunset. They’ll never be able to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> replace</span> this memory with anything. Truly it is the happiest day of these husbands’ lives.
* See the husbands driving off into the sunset in their car. Hear the engine rumble as the car speeds off into the distance.
