## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> servant</span> secures a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> so that it is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> solid</span> sitting device. If you just throw a stool on the ground it will flop over easily. But if you have a servant to dig it into the dirt a bit, it becomes nice and solid and safe for sitting!
* Picture two stools in your mind. One is solid, you want to sit on it. The other looks like the wind will knock it over. Don't sit on that!
* You need this stool to be extra <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> solid</span> because you're using it to test your new <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cata</span>pult (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かた](https://jisho.org/search/かた)</span>). If it isn't solid, when you launch it and yourself in the catapult, the stool might fall over, killing you both. And you don't want that, now do you?
* You better hope that catapult is solid too. If it isn't the whole thing will come apart when you try to launch yourself into the air.
