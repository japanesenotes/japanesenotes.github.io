## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spirit</span>s of the two <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span>s you destroyed with your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> jackhammer</span> live on in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> collar</span> you made out of them.
* You took the shredding tree bits and carefully molded them into a nice collar to go with all of your shirts. But now it's haunted.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> collar</span> keeps whispering, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Eri</span>c (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [えり](https://jisho.org/search/えり)</span>)! into your ear. Your name isn't Eric (I mean it could be, in that case wow, weird, right?), so you assume one of the trees you killed was named Eric. But that's the only name you hear, so maybe they were both named Eric? It's weird.
* Whenever you put on your collar you hear a constant stream of, Eric, pssst, hey Eric, hey! and you just have to pretend it isn't happening.
