## Mnemonics
 * If you want to wear a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> top hat</span> you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> also</span> have to wear a suit to go with it. You can't just wear a top hat, that just doesn't look right. When you think top hat, think about what you also need with it.
* Picture all the things you also need. A suit, a tie, a monocle, some shiny shoes. There's also ... something... else. What is it?
* You have a top hat and all the clothes that go with it but you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> also</span> need a nice <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>) too! You can't just get all dressed up and then have no way to get anywhere to show it off.
* Think about all the things you also need when you wear a top hat. The car is probably the most important addition. Otherwise no one can see the top hat in the first place!
