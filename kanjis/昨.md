## Mnemonics
 * With the right <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> key</span> you can unlock the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yesterday</span>, or a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> previous</span> day. The sun is in charge of the day changes, so if you use a key to unlock it, you can control the flow of time and return to yesterday, or a previous day in the past. Behold the power of the sun.
* Imagine having the power to control time like this. Picture yourself unlocking the sun to go back in time. Feel the heat of the sun and the bright light in your eyes as you unlock the door to the past.
* Time traveling to a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> previous</span> time, like <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yesterday</span>, can be rough on the body. As such, you wear a small <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sack</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さく](https://jisho.org/search/さく)</span>) to hold your valuables while you’re ripped through the sands of time. The sack keeps your important stuff from getting lost. The sack holds your key to the sun as well.
* Imagine wearing this sack as you’re sucked through the vortex of time and space. Feel yourself spinning around as you hurtle back into yesterday.
