## Mnemonics
 * There are pieces of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> on each <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> escalator</span> showing you what <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> level</span> they go to in your school. Each escalator takes you to a different <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grade</span>, so make sure you follow the right thread or you'll end up in a class that's either way above or way below your level.
* When you level up your Japanese skills, you'll take this escalator to rank up too!
* You want to see what the highest <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> level</span> is, so you go up the wrong escalator. At the top you find a giant <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cu</span>cumber (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きゅう](https://jisho.org/search/きゅう)</span>).
* A teacher comes over and says, Excuse me, this is advanced level cucumber studies. I don't think you're at this level yet... please take the escalator down and follow the threads to find your level.
