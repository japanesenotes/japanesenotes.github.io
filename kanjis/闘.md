## Mnemonics
 * At this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gate</span> you're trying to get some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> beans</span> through, but the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> measurements</span> were off and you're starting to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> struggle</span>. No matter how you push or pull these beans, they're just too big to get through the gate.
* I'm really struggling here, I thought you said you measured these beans? you ask the bean seller. I did! I mean, I struggled with the measurements, I'm not very good at math... Ugh.
* You continue to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> struggle</span> because you need to get these beans to the other side of the gate and into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> とうきょう</span>. You usually struggle a little when people want to bring things through the gate to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span>, but this is ridiculous.
* How am I supposed to sell my beans if you struggle this much just to get them into <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span>! the bean seller shouts. It's making you struggle more, and beans start falling on your head, ripping their way out of their sack.
