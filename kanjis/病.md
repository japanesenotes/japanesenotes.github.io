## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sick</span> stick of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dynamite</span> is going to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sick</span> forever. Unfortunately there are no medicines that are effective on sticks of dynamite, so once they contract a sickness, they’re sick for good.
* Imagine if you were a sick stick of dynamite. Every time you sneezed you ran the risk of blowing up. It would be a terrifying way to live. Just imagine it.
* Being nervous all the time about spontaneously exploding would probably make you sweat profusely. And you know what sweating causes? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> B.O.</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [びょう](https://jisho.org/search/びょう)</span>). You’d be one smelly stick of dynamite. B.O. is a very unpleasant smell, and being <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sick</span> is no excuse.
* Picture this as your life. You could explode at any moment, you’re sick, and you have B.O. Nobody wants to be around you because you might explode and kill them, and you stink. What a terrible way to live!
