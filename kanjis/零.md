## Mnemonics
 * You get <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rain</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> orders</span>. Your orders are to make sure there is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> zero</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spill</span>.
* Despite it raining, your orders are to make sure none (zero!) of the rain spills anywhere. Figure out what you need to do to make sure you follow these rain orders successfully. Zero spill, alright?
* The best way to make sure there is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> zero</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spill</span> when it rains is to get rid of the rain. You use a special <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ray</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れい](https://jisho.org/search/れい)</span>) gun and zap the rain right out of the sky. There will be zero spills because there will be zero rain.
* You just take your ray gun and zap! the clouds are gone. There will be zero spills today.<br />Hint: when you see the radical <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> orders</span> it's fairly likely the reading will be <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れい](https://jisho.org/search/れい)</span>.
