## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> that is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> white</span> is the most scary tsunami of all. It doesn't come in and destroy everything. No, it comes in, goes inside your door, then stays at your place <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> overnight</span>, without even asking!
* Imagine the white tsunami knocking on your door, walking into your house, and then just laying down on your bed. You try to tell it to leave, but it's a tsunami, and it says it will be staying overnight thank you very much.
* Your cat walks up to the white tsunami that's staying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> overnight</span> and decides it doesn't like it, so it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hack</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はく](https://jisho.org/search/はく)</span>) up a hairball on it. Even that doesn't get the tsunami to leave.
* See the hairball slowly sinking into the tsunami. The cat hacks up another one.
