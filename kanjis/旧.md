## Mnemonics
 * There’s a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stick</span> next to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span>, reflecting on its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> former</span> glory. The stick used to be a great tree, and the stick thinks that if it stays by the sun long enough it might return to its former form as a towering tree.
* Pretend you are the stick. Really focus on your former self as you feel the sun warm you with its rays. Imagine yourself growing, larger and larger.
* It's working, it's working! The stick is returning to its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> former</span> state and... w-wuh? It sprouted a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cu</span>cumber (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きゅう](https://jisho.org/search/きゅう)</span>).
* I guess this stick was formerly a cucumber tree. Or maybe it just tried so hard it pooped a cucumber. I don't care which one is true, you pick whatever you want to believe.
