## Mnemonics
 * After the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> comes out again and shines on these <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spikes</span>. They were super wet before, but you figure the sun probably dried them off. You lean down to touch them and nope, they's still <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> damp</span>.
* The sun did a little bit of work, so they aren't wet, but they aren't dry either. They're damp.
* As you're looking at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> damp</span> spikes, a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shih tzu</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しつ](https://jisho.org/search/しつ)</span>) prances over, slips on the damp ground, and falls right on the spike! Oh nooo!
* Luckily the shih tzu is kinda pinned between the spikes, so it isn't dead or anything, but it's definitely stuck. You try to help it out, but you slip because it's so damp and you fall in too! Imagine the sound of your cries mixing in with the shih tzu's as you both struggling to get out but can't because of how damp everything is.
