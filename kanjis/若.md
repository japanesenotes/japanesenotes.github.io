## Mnemonics
 * There are <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> on your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> right</span> to show that you're still <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> young</span>. Your body still works, you're happy, you have your entire life ahead of you! And everything smells like flowers.
* Look to your right, if you see flowers (metaphorically, maybe) then you're still young. Congratulations!
* When <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> young</span> people look to the left, they'll see their future: a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> walke</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [わか](https://jisho.org/search/わか)</span>). You know, those metal contraptions with tennis balls on the bottoms to make sure they don't scrape the floor. Everything may be flowers and happiness now, but your future is in a walker.
* All young people have a walker looming just off to the side. A sign that your youth won't last forever, dear summer child.
