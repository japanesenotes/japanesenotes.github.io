## Mnemonics
 * Under the crescent <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dog</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> boil</span>s as much <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nature</span> as it can find. Trees, sticks, mud, little animals, it boils them all down in the light of the crescent moon.
* Picture everything you'd find in nature. All of that is being boiled by this dog.
* Destroying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nature</span> like this is the dog's way of practicing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Zen</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぜん](https://jisho.org/search/ぜん)</span>) Buddhism. As it breathes in the fumes from all of the different pieces of nature being boiled down, the dog gets really zen and chill.
* Picture the dog kneeling in front of the pot of concentrated nature and breathing deeply as it practiced Zen. You kind of wish you could join it, considering how peaceful it looks.
