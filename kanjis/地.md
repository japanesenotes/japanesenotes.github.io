## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> alligator</span> lives in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> earth</span>, not the water. They can swim through the earth itself! Which is pretty scary.<br />You can think of this word as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ground</span> too, because that's kind of what earth is made of.
* Imagine seeing the earth moving as a dirt alligator rises out from the ground. You should run.
* The only way to keep this dirt alligator from dragging you under the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> earth</span> and eating you is to feed it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chee</span>se (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ち](https://jisho.org/search/ち)</span>). That way it won't lead you to a horrific death under the earth by dragging you under and spinning you around until you eat dirt (literally).
* If you ever see someone throwing cheese on the ground, now you know why. They aren't crazy, they're saving us humans from what's lurking under the earth.
