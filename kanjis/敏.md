 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Every</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> you are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alert</span> for danger. Everyone knows that the worst monsters come out in the winter so you need to be alert if you want to survive.
* Imagine yourself out in the winter wilderness. You hear twigs snapping, growling, leaves rustling. You’re incredibly alert and aware of everything going on around you.
* Being the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alert</span> fellow you are, you hear a sasquatch approaching and dive into a trash <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bin</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [びん](https://jisho.org/search/びん)</span>) to hide. The bin smells really bad and you are keenly alert to all the various stenches and smells currently penetrating your nostrils, but at least you are safe.
* Listen to the sasquatch rumble on by as you continue to smell the smelly smells of this putrid bin you’re in.
