## Mnemonics
 * There's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> coming, so you put your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fins</span> on, open your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> wide, and try to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> run alongside</span> it.
* Your mouth is open so you can scream, because this is probably a bad idea.
* You're able to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> run alongside</span> the tsunami for about ten seconds before everything <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> en</span>ds (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [えん](https://jisho.org/search/えん)</span>).
* Okay, so maybe trying to run alongside a tsunami with just some fins and a mouth full of screams and terror wasn't the best idea. But at least everything ended while you did... uh... something unique?
