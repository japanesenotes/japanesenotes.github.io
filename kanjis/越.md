## Mnemonics
 * You <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> run</span> every day and soon you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> become</span> a human that can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> go beyond</span> the normal speed limits of man. You run and you run and you run. This training allows you to become super human. You go beyond the limits of a normal human. You become a human who can run really fast.
* Run fast! Go beyond the limits imposed upon you by nature! Imagine yourself running faster than any human has ever run ever. Feel yourself cutting through the air, wind breaking across you as you break the sound barrier. Boom!
* To solidify your ability to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> go beyond</span> the abilities of other humans, you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> etch</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [えつ](https://jisho.org/search/えつ)</span>) sacred runes into your legs to preserve your running abilities. Etching these runes makes sure that your skills will never deteriorate.
* Etch these runes into your legs. Go ahead and run a finger over your legs and pretend to etch runes into them. These runes you etch will allow you to run fast forever.
