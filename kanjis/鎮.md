## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> reality</span> of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gold</span> is that it has the power to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tranquilize</span> anyone who gets their hands on it. Gold may seem cool to have in movies and songs, but in reality, it has the power to mess you up!
* Imagine being tranquilized by the sweet caress of gold coins. You can't even move. You're in a daze or something.
* You've been <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tranquilize</span>d and now drool is running down your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chin</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちん](https://jisho.org/search/ちん)</span>). It's actually really gross. But you don't care, look at all this gold! No one will care about your chin when you're rich!
* If you let gold tranquilize you, you'll drool all over your own chin. Maybe the chins of other people too, who knows?
