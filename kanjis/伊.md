## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Wolverine</span> take a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Italy</span>. Wolverine’s leader is Professor X, and they are both sliding down a big slide to Italy. How fun!
* Imagine Wolverine and his leader Professor X going down this slide to Italy. Hear them wooping and cheering as they ride down the slide. Whee~
* Before Professor X can get off the slide into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Italy</span>, a large <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>) swoops down and plucks him right out of his wheelchair. That eagle is very strong. Goodbye, Professor X!
* Imagine this eagle carrying Professor X away from Italy and out over the ocean. You can also remember this reading easily because Italy starts with the letter I. Super simple stuff.
