## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> crab</span> breaks into your games cabinet and steals a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chess piece</span>. He’s trying to impress all his tree crabs back home by showing how not afraid of humans he is. Plus the rest of the tree crabs need one last chess piece to complete their set.
* Imagine finding this tree crab in your games cabinet trying to make off with your chess piece. This tree crab is big and you weren’t expecting to find it in your games cabinet so you’re kind of terrified. You scream in horror.
* Before the tree crab can make it out with the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chess piece</span>, you shut the door to the games cabinet and lock it with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>), trapping the tree crab inside. Now what?
* You put the key in your pocket and call animal control. They unlock the cabinet with the key and remove the tree crab from your home. But who’s to say he won’t be back??
