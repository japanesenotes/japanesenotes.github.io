## Mnemonics
 * Nice! This kanji is the same as the radical that looks just like it (down to the meaning, even!). The radical is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> nine</span> and the kanji is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nine</span>, making the meaning of this kanji really easy to remember as long as you know the radical first.
* If you know your radicals well, this kanji will be a breeze!
* Although this kanji has two on'yomi to learn, the pronunciations of those two on'yomi are very similar, so that should make them easier to remember.<br />When you were <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nine</span> your favorite foods were <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coo</span>kies (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [く](https://jisho.org/search/く)</span>) and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cu</span>cumbers (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きゅう](https://jisho.org/search/きゅう)</span>). Yum yum!
* Picture nine-year-old you, lining up nine cookies and nine cucumbers. You dip a cookie in milk and bite into it, then dip a cucumber in and take a bite. Nine bites each until they're all gone. Ah, you miss being nine.
