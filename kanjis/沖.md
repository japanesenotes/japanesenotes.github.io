## Mnemonics
 * There is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> middle</span> of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> open sea</span>. Luckily there are no ships around, so the tsunami in the middle of the open sea is not damaging to anyone.
* Look at this tsunami in the middle of the open sea. When the tsunami isn’t destroying things and is just out there in the open sea it looks really majestic and pretty.
* Someone dares you to go out to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> open sea</span> and surf on the middle of the tsunami. “<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Oki</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おき](https://jisho.org/search/おき)</span>) doki,” you reply. You can’t refuse a dare. Every time someone dares you to do something, you always respond with “oki doki”.
* You really regret saying oki doki this time. You don’t want to surf on a tsunami in the middle of the open sea. Imagine doing so. It’s terrifying and wet and you don’t even know how to surf. You’re going to die.
