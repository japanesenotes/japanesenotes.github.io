* Picture your soul curled up inside this treasure chest that's just sitting out on the grass. Anyone could open it up and look inside, and this worries you quite a bit!
* Unfortunately, you also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> worry</span> about opening it yourself. You stand in front of the chest and think, Should I open it? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Nah, yah</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なや](https://jisho.org/search/なや)</span>). Wait. Nah. Yah. Dang, you can't make up your mind.
* You worry about what you'll find if you look directly at your soul. But you also worry about what will happen if someone else looks. So you're stuck in a constant state of worrying: nah or yah?!
