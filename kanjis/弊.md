## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Twenty</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> penguin</span>s together are always <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> evil</span>. Penguins are seen in groups a lot, sure, but did you know that any time there are exactly twenty penguins in a group they're plotting evil things? Evil things like global warming. And how to eat all the fish in the world so humans can't have any.
* Imagine walking around in the arctic when you stumble upon an evil group of penguins. They'd be cute if they weren't holding papers with Kill All Humans on them and tiny guns in their penguin hands.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> evil</span> penguins can't let you tell the other human's what you've seen, so they murder you and hide your body in a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hay</span>stack (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [へい](https://jisho.org/search/へい)</span>). Your family will never know what happened to you. The penguins will get away with their evil plans.
* Only someone or, in this case, something truly evil would kill someone and hide their remains under some hay. That's really disrespectful and, well, evil.
