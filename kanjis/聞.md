## Mnemonics
 * If you press your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ear</span> up to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gate</span>, you’re likely to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hear</span> what’s going on on the other side. The other people on the other side won’t know you are listening to their conversation because you are so sneaky and clever. They’ve no idea you’re on the other side of the gate hearing every word they say.
* I’m sure you’ve pressed your ear up against a wall, door, or gate at sometime to hear what’s going on on the other side of it. Remember back to a time you did this and how sneaky you felt listening in on people without them knowing. You sneaky frood, you.
* From the other side of the gate, you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hear</span> one of the people on the other side start to play a song on a recorder. You recognize the song as “Hot Cross <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Bun</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶん](https://jisho.org/search/ぶん)</span>).” You haven’t heard this song in a long time. “Hot cross buns… hot cross buns~”
* I’m sure many of you were forced to play the recorder in school at some point and were made to play the song known as hot cross buns. Picture yourself playing this song and remember the melody when you see this kanji.
