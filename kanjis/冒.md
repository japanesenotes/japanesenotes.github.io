## Mnemonics
 * When the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> gets in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eye</span>, I <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dare</span> you to stare at it. I dare you to look right at the sun. I dare you.
* Looking at the sun straight on hurts. It’s bad for your eyes and burns your brain. Imagine how painful it is to stare at the sun.
* After you’ve blinded yourself from the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dare</span> of looking at the sun and losing sight in each eye, the guy dares you to go <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bow</span>ling (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼう](https://jisho.org/search/ぼう)</span>). You’re blind now, so bowling will be quite the challenge.
* Picture yourself bowling without the power of sight. It would be awfully difficult to do well. You’d just have to concentrate really hard on the sound of the pins and determine where you need to throw the ball.
