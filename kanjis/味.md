## Mnemonics
 * What is the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> jet</span> of your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span>? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flavor</span>. It's what shoots your mouth off, which explains why it hurts so much when you eat something awesome.
* Imagine how your favorite food tastes. Imagine a jet taking off in your mouth because of it.
* And what has more <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flavor</span> than a big slab of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> me</span>at (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [み](https://jisho.org/search/み)</span>)? You love meat and its flavor nearly as much as you love the flavor of its juice. So many good things to put in your mouth! 
* Of course, if you're vegetarian imagine the flavor of the meat being terrible. Up to you. Make the mnemonic work for your lifestyle.
