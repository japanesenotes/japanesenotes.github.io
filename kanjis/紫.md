## Mnemonics
 * You <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stop</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spoon</span> from moving by tying it with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> that's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> purple</span>. The spoon wouldn't stop moving around, so you had to use your favorite purple thread to make it stop. It's the strongest thread you have.
* Imagine tying this spoon down with thread that's a color other than purple. Ah, the thread snaps. Darn, you better use your extra strong purple thread (the best color for strength!).
* You have to use all of your purple thread, and now you need more. You go into the back yard and call over your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> purple</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>).
* Oh, did you think purple things were made with dye? No no, purple is a special color. You have to find unique purple sheep to make purple thread and clothes.
