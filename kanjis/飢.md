## Mnemonics
 * You’re so hungry that you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eat</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> table</span> so you won’t <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> starve</span>. If you don’t eat this table, you will most definitely starve, so you eat the table to stay alive.
* You don’t want to starve, do you? Feel your tummy gurgle in pain. You gotta eat this table. Taste the dry wood taste on your tongue as you eat the table and get splinters in your tongue and gums.
* After you finish the table, you still feel like you might <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> starve</span> so you decide to eat every <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>) off your key ring. One by one, you eat each and every key so you don’t starve.
* Imagine eating every key. Taste the cold metal on your tongue. After you swallow each key, you hear it clink against the other keys already in your tummy. Clink!
