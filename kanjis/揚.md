## Mnemonics
 * If you have <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> it's <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> easy</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hoist</span> things above your head. If you don't have fingers, well, it's not so easy.
* Hoist the sails! Hoist the anchor! Hoist a baby! All of these situations are easier if you have a ton of working fingers. (The more the better.)
* Today, though, you have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hoist</span> a bunch of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>gurt (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よう](https://jisho.org/search/よう)</span>). It's for your job. And lucky for you, you have fingers so it's easy! But yogurt is still slippery and heavy. Oh, did I mention this yogurt isn't contained in anything? Good luck!
* Imagine hoisting loose yogurt onto a ship. Feel it between your fingers and dripping onto your head as you hoist it above you. I hope you aren't lactose intolerant, cause it's getting all over you.
