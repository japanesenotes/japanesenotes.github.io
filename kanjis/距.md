Giants have big feet and can travel large <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> distance</span>s very quickly.
* Compare the distance you can travel with one step compared to a giant. It's a considerable difference in distance.
* Going to Little <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kyo</span>to (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょ](https://jisho.org/search/きょ)</span>) is a short <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> distance</span> for a giant but a long <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> distance</span> for you.
