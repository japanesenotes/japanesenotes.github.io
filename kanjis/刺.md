## Mnemonics
 * There is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> head</span> pinned to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> by a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span>. This person has been <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stab</span>bed! They were stabbed so hard that they were pinned to the tree here.
* Imagine how much force you would need to stab someone to have the knife and go all the way through them and pin their head to a tree. That's a lot of force.
* You want to know who did the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stab</span>bing, so you look around to see if the stabber is still in the area. But all you see is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>). Sheep can't stab people, right? They have hooves and probably can't pick up knives... right?
* Imagine getting closer to the sheep and seeing blood on its wool. You squint your eyes and see some knives strapped to its back. Even closer and you see a little sign around it's neck that says, Hello, I'm the Stabbing Sheep. Uh oh.
