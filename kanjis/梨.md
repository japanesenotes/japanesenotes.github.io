## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grain</span> you cut off a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pear</span>. I don't know if you've ever seen Asian pears, but they're pretty big and sturdy. You can't just pick them off of the tree, you need the help of a knife. That's why this is a pear, and not an apple or peach or something else.
* Imagine standing below a tree full of pears. You take your knife and carefully cut them all down, one by one.
* As you cut the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pear</span>s down, you can't help but <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gnash</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なし](https://jisho.org/search/なし)</span>) your teeth. You want to eat these pears right now. You gnash and grind and wait though, because you want to have them all down before you start the feast.
* Imagine a beautiful, ripe pear in your mind. Now gnash your teeth. Mmm. You want to eat a pear right now, don't you?
