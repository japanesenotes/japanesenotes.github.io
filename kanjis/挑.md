## Mnemonics
 * When your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> finger</span>s move like that, you know it's an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> omen</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> challenge</span> that will face you soon in the future.
* What kind of challenge is it? If you look closely at your fingers sometimes you can figure out the challenge that is to come based on their movements.
* In your finger, you see a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> challenge</span>. And... if you look closely, you can see the fast movements of your fingers forming the outline of Mrs. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chou</span>'s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょう](https://jisho.org/search/ちょう)</span>) face. Oh no, the challenge is going to be Mrs. Chou!
* Whenever you see an omen (radical), there's a good chance that Mrs. Chou will be a part of it. This is not a good sign.
