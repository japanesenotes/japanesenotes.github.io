## Mnemonics
 * Put a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> guard</span> at your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gate</span> to get a good <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inspection</span> of your neighborhood going. The guard will stand there all day inspecting everything and then report it all back to you. You won't have to do any of the inspection yourself!
* Imagine the guard doing his inspection in front of the gate all day long. He should have a nice report for you once he's done.
* His <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inspection</span> is complete, but it looks like he's used an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> etch</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [えつ](https://jisho.org/search/えつ)</span>) a sketch to record all the results. That's not really helpful. If you shake it all the inspection results will disappear!
* If you hire a guard to stand at your gate and conduct an inspection of your neighborhood, make sure you tell him not to use an etch a sketch!
