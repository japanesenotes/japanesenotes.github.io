## Mnemonics
 * <div>When <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> comes your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> direction</span>, the trees must <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> release</span> their leaves for the coming cold.</div>
* Picture winter heading straight for you and frosting everything over. Now picture the leaves being released by the trees.
* The trees <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> release</span> all of their leaves onto your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ho</span>me (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほう](https://jisho.org/search/ほう)</span>). Slowly, you watch in horror as your home is consumed by the released leaves. They enter in through the windows, doors, and the chimney.
* Release my home from this leaf prison! you shout at the now bare trees.
