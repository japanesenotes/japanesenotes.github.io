* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> elegant</span> fang makes the turkey look more like a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ga</span>rgoyle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [が](https://jisho.org/search/が)</span>) than a turkey. In fact, you haven't seen it move at all. Maybe it is just an elegant gargoyle!
