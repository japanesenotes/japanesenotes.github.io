## Mnemonics
 * If you try to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> things with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span>, the police will put you in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> net</span> as your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> penalty</span> for breaking the knife laws. You can't just go up to other people and say things with a knife out.
* Imagine getting so mad that you use a knife instead of words to say what you're trying to say. A net falls over you and pulls you down. The knife goes flying. This is your penalty for acting like a crazy person.
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> penalty</span> for breaking the law isn't over. Now that you're stuck in a net, you can't fight back when they hit you with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bats</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばつ](https://jisho.org/search/ばつ)</span>). 
* If you don't want to be punished with bats, maybe next time don't use a knife instead of your words.
