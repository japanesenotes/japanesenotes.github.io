## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tiger</span> needs to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> think</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> consider</span> its actions before it attacks. Tigers are smart hunters, so they need to consider all options and really think through a situation.
* Look at this tiger as it approaches you. Think what things it has to consider. It has to consider how big of a threat you are and so on. You need to consider how you’re going to escape from this tiger.
* It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> consider</span>ing you for so long that it takes out a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ro</span>be (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りょ](https://jisho.org/search/りょ)</span>), a pipe, and an armchair and starts puffing away, staring intently at you. You didn't even know tigers could wear robes, but this one seems to use it to help itself think.
* Consider this! Tigers look great in robes.
