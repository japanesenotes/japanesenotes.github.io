## Mnemonics
 * You hold the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> festival</span> up with your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> but it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grate</span>s on them. The roof is heavy, and you have to walk to keep up, so the roof is grating on them really, really badly.
* Have you ever been to a Japanese festival? There's always one of those portable shrines that are basically just roofs people hold up. That's what you're trying to hold with your fingers as the whole thing grates on them.
* Just when you thought the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grat</span>ing couldn't get worse, someone <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sat</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さつ](https://jisho.org/search/さつ)</span>) down on the roof! AHG! It hurts!
* Picture a very large person that decided to sat down right on top of the roof you've been carrying through the festival. The weight makes the grating so much worse, you can feel the skin coming off of your fingers.
