## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Crab</span>s in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> make a great <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foundation</span> for a seaside hut. It's right on the seashore, where all the crabs dig their holes in the dirt. But as they get old and die, their bodies form a strong base. Perfect for the foundation of a building like this!
* Do you live on the beach? Maybe the foundation of your house was made from crabs in dirt too. Why don't you go outside and check?
* Remember, a good <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foundation</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>) to a good house. No, literally. You have to use a piece of the foundation to make the key to your house.
* Keys to houses are always made out of a piece of the foundation it was built upon. How else would they be unique from one another?
