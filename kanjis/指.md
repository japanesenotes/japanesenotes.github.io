## Mnemonics
 * Try to use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spoon</span> out some of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> and you'll come back with just one <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> finger</span>.
* Look down at your finger and the burned stumps where the rest of your fingers used to be. It hurts. And you're sad. But at least you still have one finger left.
* Don't worry, you aren't the only one out there with just one <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> finger</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>) only have one finger too. I mean, they're hooves, which are really just a single animal finger. It's just big and kind of flat.
* Picture sitting with a sheep. It's right across from you, staring into your eyes. It reaches out its sheep finger hoof and you reach out with your finger. They touch. It's magical.
