## Mnemonics
 * If someone is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sick</span> feed them <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> charcoal</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> heal</span> them. Okay, so maybe you shouldn't feed it directly to them, but charcoal has amazing water filtration powers. So put charcoal in their water and the water will heal them right up.
* Imagine being sick. Like sick as a dog sick. And then you take some charcoal, put it into your drinking water, and then you're healed!
* You aren't the only one that needs to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> heal</span>ed, so you take your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> row</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りょう](https://jisho.org/search/りょう)</span>) boat out onto the lake where your town gets its drinking water and you dump a bunch of charcoal into it! Now everyone will be healed when they drink.
* Picture yourself rowing your row boat into the lake with huge chunks of solid charcoal. You carefully break them up and toss them over the side, so you can heal everyone.
