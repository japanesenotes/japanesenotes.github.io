## Mnemonics
 * There is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mountain</span> on top of a bunch of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> with a steep <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cliff</span>. This is a bit redundant, but the mountain and the dirt just make the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cliff</span> even bigger and steeper and scarier.
* Imagine a cliff. Now add two big helpings of dirt and a mountain to the top. It's still a cliff, it's just more cliff than before.
* As you’re peering over this tall <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cliff</span>, somebody behind you shouts, “Hey, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> guy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がい](https://jisho.org/search/がい)</span>)!” This startles you and you tumble down the cliff. Apparently so did he, because you can hear him saying, Hey guy! OOF! Are you okay? OOF! Guy? Guy!!!” as you both fall.
* Imagine falling down this huge cliff and the last words you have to hear before you splat on the ground is someone yelling Guy at you over and over. What a way to go.
