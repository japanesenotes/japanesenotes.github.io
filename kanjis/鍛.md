## Mnemonics
 * You want to turn your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gold</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> comb</span> into a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> weapon</span>, so you throw it into the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> forge</span>.
* Once the gold comb has melted down in the forge, you can forge it into whatever weapon you want.
* You're trying to work the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> forge</span>, but it's harder than you thought. You end up forging outside all day and get a wicked <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たん](https://jisho.org/search/たん)</span>).
* Most people who do forge work have tans. And now you know why.
