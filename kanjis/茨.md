## Mnemonics
 * If you look at <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> the first thing you notice are the leaves and petals themselves, then the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> next</span> thing you notice are the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> briar</span>s. You never see <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thorn</span>s first, only after you've looked at the flowers. 
* Imagine what you see next after looking at the pretty flowers. The briars are what you see next. Spiky and sharp. It would have been nice if you had seen them first.
* When you see the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> briar</span>s you can't help but yell, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Eee! Ba riars</span>! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [いばら](https://jisho.org/search/いばら)</span>)! You pause funny because you prick your finger on one while you're yelling. Ouch!
* Imagine seeing the briars and yelling out Ba RI ars! as you prick your finger on one.
