## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> that hits at <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> night</span> leaves even more <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fluid</span> than normal. It's dark at night, so the sun isn't there to help evaporate all that tsunami <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> liquid</span>.
* Picture the dark fluids from the tsunami flowing by your window at night. You look out and the liquid is shining in the moonlight. It looks like an entire sea is out there!
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fluid</span> stays in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 駅</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [えき](https://jisho.org/search/えき)</span>) longer than anywhere else. All of those tsunami liquids pour deep inside the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [駅](https://jisho.org/search/駅)</span> late at night and the sun still can't reach them to help evaporate them during the day. It's a real *night*mare.
* Picture the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [駅](https://jisho.org/search/駅)</span> filled to the brim with fluids and liquids. Maybe if you swim, you'll be able to catch your train.
