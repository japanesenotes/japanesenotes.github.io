## Mnemonics
 * You want some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> to put on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> canopy</span> above your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> helicopter</span> to keep the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bird</span>s away, so you ask people what they would <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> recommend</span>.
* You've bought flowers before, but you really don't know which ones would work best to stop birds from landing on the canopy and pooping on your helicopter.
* You ask for a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> recommend</span>ation from the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cen</span>taur (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span>) that owns the local flower shop. Now he's walking around your helicopter canopy and staring at the birds, nodding.
* I hope the centaur recommends a cheap flower... but with your luck flowers that keep birds away will cost a fortune.
