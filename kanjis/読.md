## Mnemonics
 * You have to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> what you’re <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sell</span>ing because people don’t like to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> read</span>. If they walk right by and don’t read, you better say what you have for sale so they’ll know! Read it out loud to them.
* Imagine reading what you have for sale out loud to people walking by because they’re too lazy to read it for themselves.
* What are you forced to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> read</span> aloud to sell? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Yo-</span>yo (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よ](https://jisho.org/search/よ)</span>) instructions! You’d think they’d be self explanatory, but there are actually a lot of rules and tricks that you have to read to get good at yo-yoing. Read all of these out loud so you can sell them.
* Imagine reading through your list of yo-yo tricks. Do you know how to pronounce those weird yo-yo names?
