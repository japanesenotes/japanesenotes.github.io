## Mnemonics
 * You have a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> small</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span>. The thing about small slides is that they can only fit a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> few</span> people at a time.
* Imagine a small slide (how could you not, after you see the radicals?) with only a few people on it, trying to move forward. Only a few people are required to create a slide traffic jam, though. :(
* Why is there <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a little</span> traffic jam on the slide? Because the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>) is using the slide and he loves little things. He's forcing everyone to stop and watch, even though there are people backed up behind him. How inconsiderate.
* Imagine this in your head. A traffic jam on a little slide, all because the shogun is using it. Picture some caution tape, orange cones, and Japanese secret service members all making sure no one gets close to the shougun while he slides. A few people are crying. They want to slide, they want to leave.
