## Mnemonics
 * If what you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> comes out <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> blue</span>, everyone knows that means you made a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> request</span>. You request a favor and the words slide out of your mouth in a bright, blue blob. They hover in front of you for a few seconds, before splashing onto the person you made the request to.
* Picture this blue, slimy request. You could have done that thing by yourself, but you requested it of someone else, and now it's all over and everyone can see it.
* The next time someone <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> request</span>s something from you, take out your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sa</span>ber (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せい](https://jisho.org/search/せい)</span>) and slice it in half!
* Now they have the blue request gunk on them, and you can walk away as your already-blue sword absorbs the rest. Oh, and you don't have to fulfill the request (bonus!).
