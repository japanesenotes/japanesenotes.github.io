## Mnemonics
 * This kanji uses a modified <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> jet</span> radical. The front area of the wing is wider than the middle area of the wing. This may seem counterintuitive, but by doing this they can fit so much more jet fuel. The jet zooms off and keeps going for a long, long time, until it reaches the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> end</span> of the earth.
* Imagine the end of the earth being like how they imagined it pre-Columbus era. Just a big drop going off into space, giant waterfalls plummeting down. Your crazy jet has made it to the very end! Congratulations!
* When you get to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> end</span> of the world, you land your jet and put out a few <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mats</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まつ](https://jisho.org/search/まつ)</span>) to sit on so you can view the sights. 
* It's surprisingly dirty down here, because all the water takes the garbage this way. That's why you sit on these mats you brought.
