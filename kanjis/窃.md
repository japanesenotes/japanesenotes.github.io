They were just left in that hole after all, it's not like anyone was using them. And even if they were, they'll never know you were the one to steal them, right?

This particular set is from the Seven Samurai movie. Yes! What a great steal!
* Imagine your delight as you look up the different sword sets online and realize you happened to steal the best one!
