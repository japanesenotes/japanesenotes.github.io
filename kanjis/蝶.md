 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> insect</span> that is amongst all the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> world</span>'s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span>s is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> butterfly</span>. They are always hanging around trees, those butterflies.
* Imagine any tree in the world with different kinds of butterflies fluttering around. Then go to another tree in the world that looks completely different. Once again, butterflies! They really are fluttering around every tree in the world.
* As you look at a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> butterfly</span>, fluttering around a tree, a hand reaches out from the tree and grabs it, then starts plucking the wings off. An evil laugh comes from inside the tree, and you know it's Mrs. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chou</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょう](https://jisho.org/search/ちょう)</span>). 
* She grabs another butterfly and starts pulling off wings again, though this time you can see her evil face looking at you while she does it. I hate butterflies, she says. They are always dying in my tea.
