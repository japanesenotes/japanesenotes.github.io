## Mnemonics
 * A small <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> comes in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> morning</span> with the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span>. That just means the ocean gets bigger when the moon's out, and that my friends is simply the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tide</span>.
* The moon does affect the tides a bit, so you can imagine the tsunami as the water getting bigger whenever the moon is out. That's just the tide.
* You go check out the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tide</span>. The water is coming in a little stronger, and something washes up on the shore. It's a body! You roll the body over and it is Mrs. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chou</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょう](https://jisho.org/search/ちょう)</span>)!
* She wakes up and says, If only you came at low tide then I would never have been saved! She jumps up and runs off, yelling something about destroying the world.
