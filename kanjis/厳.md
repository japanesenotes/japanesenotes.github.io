## Mnemonics
 * If you see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grass</span>y <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cliff</span> with an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> elf</span> under it in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span>, it's because their parents are so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> strict</span>. When elf kids misbehave they're supposed to go stand under grassy cliffs to think about what they've done.
* Only really, really strict parents would make their kids do that in the middle of winter! It's cold!
* One of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> strict</span> parents of this elf kid is... <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Gen</span>ji (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [げん](https://jisho.org/search/げん)</span>)?! Looks like he had another illegitimate kid... this time with an elf.
* Oh Genji, if only you were as strict about using protection as you were on your elf child.
