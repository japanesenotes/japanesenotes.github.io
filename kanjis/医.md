## Mnemonics
 * You're in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cage</span> and you've been shot by an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> arrow</span>. Obviously things are looking pretty bad. You need some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> medicine</span> if you hope to live.
* More specifically, antibiotics. Your wound is festering pretty badly.
* When we need to remember the sound <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span> we use the word Eagle.<br />You need your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> medicine</span> really bad. Then, you look up. There's an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>) flying overhead. He has a package. It's medicine! You're saved!
* Or, so you think. He just keeps circling and circling. Feel some hate for the eagle. Why isn't he dropping the medicine? You don't have long to live!
