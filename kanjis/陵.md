## Mnemonics
 * The only <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span> you'll get <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> frostbite</span> in is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mausoleum</span>. Mausoleums and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tomb</span>s weren't made for living people, so they aren't insulated from the cold. No one cares if a dead body gets frostbite.
* Unfortunately, you're realizing this because you thought a mausoleum would be a good hiding place from the winter cold. Spoilers, it's not.
* You need to escape this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mausoleum</span> now but the only way out is on a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> row</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りょう](https://jisho.org/search/りょう)</span>) boat over a creepy frozen pond. You've heard of these mausoleum row boats before, and you're pretty sure they're cursed.
* Imagine taking your frostbitten fingers and trying to get away from the mausoleum in this row boat. It looks like it was made of bones and it is not very seaworthy. But you row with all your might, because you don't want to end up a permanent fixture in this tomb!
