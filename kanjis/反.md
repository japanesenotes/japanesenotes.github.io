## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span> is in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cliff</span>. If someone has a stool deep inside a cliff, they are most likely pretty <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> anti</span> society, hiding away like that.
* Imagine someone who looks super antisocial (and a little feral). Ask them why they're sitting on this stool inside a cliff... they reply because they hate people. They are anti people!
* Turns out, when you go to this guy and pull off his beard, he's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Han</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はん](https://jisho.org/search/はん)</span>) Solo, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> anti</span>-hero from Star Wars! What is Han doing here, so hidden away? He's obviously hiding from Jabba because he doesn't want to get frozen in carbonite again.
* Make sure you get to the point where you pull this anti-social guy's beard off, to reveal Han Solo beneath. Be surprised... not just because he's Han Solo, but because he's real, too! Maybe you can yell out Han! Your people need you!
