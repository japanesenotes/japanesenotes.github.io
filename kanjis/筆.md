## Mnemonics
 * Out of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bamboo</span>, you make a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> brush</span> – a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> writing brush</span>. This is no ordinary brush, mind you. It is a brush specifically designed for writing elegant characters. And it’s made from bamboo!
* Imagine yourself using this bamboo writing brush. Do you know many kanji? Of course you do! Imagine yourself writing them all with this nice writing brush. It’s actually fun to write things with it!
* Once the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> writing brush</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hits</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひつ](https://jisho.org/search/ひつ)</span>) that paper, it’s like you transform into a totally different person. All of a sudden you’re a master calligrapher, writing anything and everything in a most beautiful fashion. Once that brush hits the paper, it’s on!
* Imagine the sound the brush makes when it hits the paper. It’s a bit of a plop, and then kind of a scratching sound as the brush bristles move around. Really focus on this sound that the brush makes when it hits the paper.
