## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> animal</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span>? He's just this guy who lives in the forest and thinks he's king of all the animals. He's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lunatic</span>, though.
* While we're speaking of animals, he's absolutely bat sh*t crazy.
* You might see that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crazy</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lunatic</span> hanging around the outskirts of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> きょうと</span>. He'll lurk near your trash cans and scream, I AM THE ANIMAL KING! and run away with some orange peels.
* I think he maybe got too friendly with some raccoons and beavers and went crazy. Watch out for him if you live in <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょうと](https://jisho.org/search/きょうと)</span>, rabies is no joke.
