## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grain</span>'s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> child</span> will grow with the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seasons</span>. In spring the grain is born, it grows in summer, is harvested in fall, and dies in winter.
* Watch the grain children live their entire lives throughout the seasons. Though there are 72 seasons in Japan, so the life of a grain is actually really long there.
* All of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seasons</span> have their own special <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>). As they change, that season's key appears and unlocks the next step in the grain's life.
* Picture these seasonal keys floating through the sky, unlocking the weather changes, the growth of new grains, and the aging of us all.
