## Mnemonics
 * When you drive a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> car</span>, everyone under your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> is putting their <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> life</span> in your hands, even if they don't say it with their <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span>—it's still under your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> control</span>.
* It's really important to remember how many things are under your control when you operate a vehicle. It isn't just the people in your car either, it's everyone and everything in your way too.
* You have to maintain <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> control</span> of your car or you'll hit a bunch of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cats</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かつ](https://jisho.org/search/かつ)</span>). The roads are full of cats at all times. And if you lose control of your car for just a second, you'll hit at least two or three cats.
* If you don't want to think about hitting adorable cats with your car, you better maintain control. You're responsible!
