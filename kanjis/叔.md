## Mnemonics
 * There were lots of things that were <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> above</span> you when you were <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> small</span> that you would need a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span> to reach, so you just asked your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> aunt</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> uncle</span> to get them for you.
* Your parents didn't want you having those things, which is why they put them up high, but your aunt and uncle would always spoil you and get them for you.
* You ask your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> aunt</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> uncle</span> to help you reach your special <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> o</span>bi (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [お](https://jisho.org/search/お)</span>) from high up in the closet. 
* You aren't supposed to wear your obi unless it's a special occasion, but your aunt and uncle don't know that. Now you can run around with it on your head and your parents can't stop you by putting it up high!
