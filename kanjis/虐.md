## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Tiger</span>s and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> wolverine</span>s have one big thing in common and it's that the government likes to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> oppress</span> them. It doesn't matter if you're the animal or a mutant X-Men hybrid. The government will go out of its way to oppress you if you are one. 
* Imagine being a tiger or a wolverine or a tiger-wolverine and being oppressed by the government just because you're different. Imagine being stuck in a cage. Not being allowed to vote. It's awful!
* Tiger and wolverine people are so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> oppress</span>ed that the only thing they're allowed to amuse themselves with is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Gak</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎゃく](https://jisho.org/search/ぎゃく)</span>). You know, that weird goo they made us play with when we were kids? Well that's not so fun when it's all you have.
* Imagine being a tiger/wolverine girl and being so oppressed that you can only sit in a cage, playing with goopy Gak all day. This blows...
