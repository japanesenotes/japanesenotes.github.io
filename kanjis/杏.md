## Mnemonics
 * What does a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> make that you'd want to put in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span>? An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> apricot</span>! Apricots are also about the size of an open mouth, so they kind of look like mouths hanging down under the trees. You can bite them right off the tree with your own mouth!
* Picture the mouth sized apricots hanging down off the tree. Imagine using your own mouth to bite them down. Just don't swallow the pit!
* After you put the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> apricot</span> in your mouth you realize that this tastes really familiar, but not pleasant. It tastes just like the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> an</span>chovies (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あん](https://jisho.org/search/あん)</span>) from the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> zoo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ず](https://jisho.org/search/ず)</span>) smell. How did that happen? You don't like apricots anymore.
* Imagine trying to eat the bite sized apricot and spitting it out after the taste of anchovies from the zoo fill you up.
