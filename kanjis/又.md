## Mnemonics
 * You're sitting on your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> again</span>!!?
* There's someone you know who carries a stool around with her all the time. Why? Because she's super pregnant and can't walk too far. You're walking with her, but she has to stop every few feet and sit on her stool, again and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> again</span>. Feel irritated about this, because it will help you to remember the meaning of this kanji better. Imagine this scene taking place several times as you're trying to walk to your destination together, but she's too slow and it's super-duper irritating.
* So, she's really pregnant, and carrying a stool, sitting on it again and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> again</span>. Where are you two going? Where would a super preggers person go? Well, she needs to go to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mata</span>nity (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [また](https://jisho.org/search/また)</span>) store to get new clothes for her giant baby stomach.
* I know mata and maternity are a bit of a stretch, but the goal is to get you to the memory of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [また](https://jisho.org/search/また)</span> in your head, so they don't necessarily need to be exactly the same. If this can get you to the correct memory in your head, then it does the right thing, and that's good. So, make that your goal and you'll probably remember the reading for this kanji!
