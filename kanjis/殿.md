You all bow and say, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Milord</span>, this gift is for you. Because that's the proper way to address your lord.
* When you address your lord you better say milord, otherwise you might get beheaded with the weapon you're all giving him.
* As you give the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lord</span> his weapon together, you see his face turn into a frown, What's wrong, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Milord</span>? you ask. THERE'S A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> DEN</span>T (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [でん](https://jisho.org/search/でん)</span>)! he bellows.
* Oh no, oh no, oh no! Now the lord is running around with his dented weapon trying to put dents in all of you. You don't want a dent in your head! Run!
