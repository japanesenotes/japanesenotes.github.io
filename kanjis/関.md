## Mnemonics
 * The gate of horns leads to heaven where you will meet the people you are RELATED to.<br><br>This <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gate</span> of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span> will take you to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heaven</span>. These horns are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> related</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> connected</span> to heaven in some way.
* Perhaps they are related to heaven because the devil has horns? Perhaps they are connected to heaven because these are the horns of heaven's enemies? The real reason they're connected will be revealed in the reading mnemonic.
* They are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> related</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> connected</span> to heaven because these are the horns that Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>) made from his enemies. God said he could come into heaven if he made a gate of horns, so that's what he did.
* Imagine Genghis Khan taking horns off his enemies, and making a gate to heaven. The horn gate is connected to both heaven and Genghis Khan in that way.
