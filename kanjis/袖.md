## Mnemonics
 * A mix of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spirit</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> reason</span> helped you invent the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sleeve</span>. Your spirit told you your arms were uncomfortable, stuck to your sides under that shirt. Reason told you that maybe, just maybe, if you made holes for your arms something good would come out of it. And that's how sleeves were born!
* Your spirit and your arms are free! Imagine how unreasonable no sleeves were. How on earth did you survive without them?!
* To make the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sleeve</span> holes you took your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shoe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅう](https://jisho.org/search/しゅう)</span>) and kicked a hole through your shirt. Then you did it again on the other side, because you have two of those weird arm things.
* You also take the extra fabric that helped make your sleeves and turned them into another pair of really light shoes, since they're shoe shaped from the whole process anyway. Waste not!
