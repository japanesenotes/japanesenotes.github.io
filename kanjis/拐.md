You can't see anything about them, since they're all covered up. All you see is their angry mouth and the sword they keep putting near your fingers. 
* Imagine you've been kidnapped. And the person who kidnapped you is going to cut off some of your fingers and mail them to your parents if they don't pay the ransom soon enough. You don't want your fingers to be cut off with a sword! Help!
* You've been <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kidnap</span>ped and your kidnapper has asked for one thing in exchange for your safe return: a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ka</span>yak (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かい](https://jisho.org/search/かい)</span>). Kayaks are expensive. And it's way easier for this dude to kidnap you and demand your family buy one and give it to them than for them to work for one.
* If your parents don't send in the kayak to your kidnapper soon, you're gonna lose some fingers. Come on guys, just get the kayak already!!!
