## Mnemonics
 * You're sewing something with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> but you and your creation get <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> frostbite</span> while you're still working. Luckily the snowflakes freeze themselves into the cloth and turn into a pretty <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> design</span>. They swirl around and press a unique snowy design into the fabric. This is nice for you because you can't sew anymore with your frostbitten hands.
* Imagine holding your creation in your frostbitten hands as the snowflake design starts to appear. The design gets more and more complicated the longer you watch, twisting this way and that, like it's dancing in front of your eyes.
* As you watch the snowflake <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> design</span> form you realize they're moving in a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rin</span>g (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りん](https://jisho.org/search/りん)</span>) pattern. Rings inside bigger rings, linked with smaller rings.
* Try to picture this ring design in your head. It's something no human hands could have made, frostbitten or otherwise.
