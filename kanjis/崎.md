## Mnemonics
 * On top of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> big</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mountain</span>, wearing a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lip ring</span>, you see a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cape</span> jutting out into the ocean. You’re wearing a lip ring because you’re a cool and edgy guy who likes to climb big mountains. From the top of the big mountain, you see a cape.
* You’re tired from just climbing up the big mountain but the view is worth it. Feel the wind blustering around you as you take in the beautiful scenery, including the cape.
* Atop the big mountain overlooking the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cape</span>, you start to play what you call hacky <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sacky</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さき](https://jisho.org/search/さき)</span>). Most people say hacky sack, but you’re edgy and cool and have a lip ring so you say sacky instead.
* See yourself doing your hacky sacky thing on top of this big mountain. Concentrate to keep the hacky sacky in the air as it’s a long way down.
