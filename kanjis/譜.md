## Mnemonics
 * If you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lineup</span> of your family members that have lived on this earth under the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span>, you're really explaining your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> genealogy</span>.<br />This kanji has a second meaning too. It means score. So if you're <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span>ing the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> line up</span> of what happened today under the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> you're really just saying the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> score</span> of a game. So which is it? Are you talking about the past or something that happened today? That's what makes the difference.
* Say the line up of what happened under the sun. It's the genealogy of your family or the score of your game!
* if you can't tell the difference between your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> genealogy</span> and a game's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> score</span> you're a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foo</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>) and I can't help you. You aren't a fool, are you? You know the difference.
* Your family genealogy and your game's score aren't even close to being the same thing. Memorize these or everyone will think you're a fool.
