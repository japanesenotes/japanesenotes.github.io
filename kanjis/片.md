## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> one sided</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> one sided</span> kanji are the same!
* Know your radicals, yo!
* Think of anything that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> one sided</span>. A battle. A sports game. A relationship. What makes them so one sided? One side always has a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cata</span>pult (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かた](https://jisho.org/search/かた)</span>).
* Imagine a one sided situation that you've had. Now imagine the winning side with a catapult. For example, a baseball game where one team is destroying the other. That's because instead of a pitcher, they have a catapult.
