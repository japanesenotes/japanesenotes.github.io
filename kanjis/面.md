## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> face</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> face</span> kanji are the same! But this isn't just a face like the one you're looking at your computer/phone with. It's the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> surface</span> kind of face too!
* The next time you look at your face, also notice how much surface area it has.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> face</span> you're looking at, that has a lot of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> surface</span> area, belongs to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> men</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [めん](https://jisho.org/search/めん)</span>). Not a single man, but all men put together. It's hundreds of thousands of men's faces in a row.
* Look at the face of all men put together. Measure how much surface area they all take up.
