## Mnemonics
 * Looking up to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cliff</span>, you see the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span>s, and the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> shining down on them. Using the sun and the trees (up there on the cliff), you've devised a method to tell what time of the year it is, based on where the shadow from the trees fall. After a while, you develop a bigger system. This system is a whole <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> calendar</span>.
* Look at the different shadow patterns. Know what they all mean. This is your very own calendar system.
* Remember the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [歴史](https://jisho.org/search/歴史)</span>, which means history? Using a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> calendar</span>, you too can remember history (otherwise, who knows when these things happened). So, the reading for this kanji is the same as the reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [歴史](https://jisho.org/search/歴史)</span>'s beginning, because they're related.
* Make sure you make the connection between the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [歴史](https://jisho.org/search/歴史)</span> and this kanji. If you do, it'll be much easier to remember the reading of this kanji.
