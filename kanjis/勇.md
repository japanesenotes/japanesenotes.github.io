## Mnemonics
 * When a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mama</span> stands with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> man</span>, it gives him <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> courage</span>.
* When all alone, though, the man has no courage. It helps when his mama is there to back him up. Imagine a man's mama standing there with him, saying you can do it, boy while giving him reassurance.
* A man needs <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> courage</span> to stand up to all the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> you</span>ths (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆう](https://jisho.org/search/ゆう)</span>) of the world.
