## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grain</span> is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> certain</span> to keep a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> secret</span>.
* Imagine telling a piece of grain your deepest, darkest secret.
* If someone finds out your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> secret</span> (not from the grain though, it will certainly keep it) then your entire face will fill with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hea</span>t (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひ](https://jisho.org/search/ひ)</span>).
* This works both ways too. If someone tells you a secret, that same heat fills you up. Now whether this heat is from embarrassment or the rush of getting to be part of a secret is up to you to figure out.
