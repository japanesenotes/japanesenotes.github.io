## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> pushes all the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fish</span> closer to land, making for some easy <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fishing</span>. The tsunami starts out in the middle of the ocean and pushes all the fish towards the coast where everyone does their fishing. With all the fish pushed closer to land and closer together, it’s very easy for people to go fishing in one spot and catch a lot of fish.
* Imagine going fishing for fish in a fishing spot after a tsunami. There are SO many fish here. Your hook barely touches the water and there’s already a fish on it. Man, fishing like this is easy! Smell the smell of fish and sea air around you.
* To get to the best <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fishing</span> spot you need to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> go</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎょ](https://jisho.org/search/ぎょ)</span>) <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> row</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りょう](https://jisho.org/search/りょう)</span>) out to the middle of the ocean. You go by means of rowing. To get to the fish and do the fishing, you need to go and row out to sea.
* Go! Go row! Go and row for the fishing! How do you go? You row! The row part should be pretty easy to remember since you gotta row your boat out to sea, but if you’re having trouble with the go part, just remember that it has the same reading as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [魚](https://jisho.org/search/魚)</span>.
