## Mnemonics
 * On every <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> boat</span> there is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> table</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lid</span> on it that's used for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> navigation</span>. When you take the lid off, there is a big map, a sextant, and some little boat miniatures. All the navigation tools.
* You forget to put the lid back on the navigation station and all those tools and boat pieces go flying around the boat and into the water. Oops.
* You watch the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> navigation</span> equipment roll away and then you feel a slap on the back of your head. Ouch! You turn around and there stands <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>, who you took with you as the navigator of this expedition. And, you just lost all his stuff!
* Picture this seafaring <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> angrily chasing you around the ruined navigation station, trying to hit you with a telescope.
