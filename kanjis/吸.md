## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> is like an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> escalator</span> you use to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suck</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inhale</span> things into your body.
* If you're ever having trouble remembering how to suck or inhale, just picture an actual escalator that leads into your mouth. That'll definitely help.
* Use this mouth ability to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suck</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cu</span>cumbers (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きゅう](https://jisho.org/search/きゅう)</span>) into your mouth. Cucumbers are shaped like cylinders so you can suck them into your mouth like this. Just as nature intended.
* You can inhale a cucumber too, I suppose, but don't tell anyone I told you to.
