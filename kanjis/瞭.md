## Mnemonics
 * Rub <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> charcoal</span> under your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eye</span>s if you want to see <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clear</span>ly. Sports players also rub charcoal under their eyes to see nice and clear in the bright sun.
* You can even rub charcoal in your eyes if you really want to clear them up, but you should probably only do this under the supervision of your eye doctor.
* You have to have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clear</span> vision because you're about to go out in your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> row</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りょう](https://jisho.org/search/りょう)</span>) boat. The light off the water shines right into your eyes and you need the charcoal to clear that up for you. Otherwise you'll end up crashing into the shore or going over a waterfall to your death.
* Imagine how dangerous it would be not to have clear vision while you row around in a row boat. You might even smack yourself in the face with your own oars.
