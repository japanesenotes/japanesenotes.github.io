## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> boat</span> has <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fins</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span>! It's still a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boat</span> though.
* Picture this boat. It's still a boat, but there is a big mouth on the front and it has fins that it paddles forward with.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boat</span> belongs to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cen</span>taurs (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span>). That's probably why you've never seen a boat like it before.
* Picture this mouth and boat with a bunch of centaurs riding in it. Centaurs have a lot more parts than humans, so it makes sense that their boats have more parts (animal ones) too.
