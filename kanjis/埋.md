## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> next to your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> village</span> is where you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bury</span> the dead. People don't live forever, so every village has a patch of dirt specifically used for burying dead things.
* Imagine the village where you grew up. Can you see the dirt area where all your ancestors were buried?
* You don't just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bury</span> dead relatives here. You also buried your dead pet <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> u</span>ni (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span>) in that dirt. You thought having an uni as a pet would be a good idea. Too bad uni need water to survive.
* Imagine crying as you bury your pet uni. Your tears can't save it now. (Though it is a bit ironic, since it needed salt water.)
