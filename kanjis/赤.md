## Mnemonics
 * The radical for <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> red</span> and the kanji for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> red</span> are the same thing!
* What a lucky ducky - as long as you know your radicals, you'll know this kanji's meaning as well!
* Think of Fozzie Bear. He says Wakka wakka wakka a lot. Now, think of an evil, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> red</span> (and I mean totally red) Fozzie Bear. He drops the w and just says <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Aka</span> Aka Aka, because he's totally evil.
* You'll have to think of him as really, really red, though. Like, a glowing, searing kind of red. Red enough for you to associate red with this evil Fozzie Bear. If you do, then you'll be good to go (as long as you know his catch phrase as well).
