## Mnemonics
 * Give <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> genius</span> and they'll have no problem accumulating <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wealth</span>. Geniuses can make loads of money out of pretty much anything, so shellfish are like easy-mode.
* Picture the genius huddled over a pile of shellfish, muttering about all the wealth he'll amass once he's done.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wealth</span> comes pouring in, once the genius's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cy</span>borg (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さい](https://jisho.org/search/さい)</span>) is unveiled. It's a half-man, half-shellfish cyborg that's making him rich! It can even play the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> xy</span>lophone (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ざい](https://jisho.org/search/ざい)</span>)!
* You'd be wealthy too if you sold that cyborg you made. It may not have any shellfish in it and it can't play the xylophone, but you could change that...
