## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Flowers</span> that you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> oversee</span> are always <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> indigo</span>. You aren't sure why though...
* Imagine if every flower you were supposed to oversee was indigo. Indigo everywhere!
* Wait, maybe these flowers are only <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> indigo</span> because there is something wrong with your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eye</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あい](https://jisho.org/search/あい)</span>)! Maybe your eyes are indigo and that's why it's all you see!
* Can you imagine having indigo-only seeing eyes? I can. Because of this awesome mnemonic.
