## Mnemonics
 * In this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span> there's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> small</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> that's <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> small</span>. They keep this small, small sun inside of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crevice</span>.
* You wouldn't want to keep a sun out in the open, even if it's small (and small). You'd put it inside something, like a crevice. Imagine walking into the building and seeing the small sun right inside, in a crevice.
* They keep the sun in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crevice</span> because this is a place where people <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ski</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すき](https://jisho.org/search/すき)</span>).
* If the sun were out in the open, it'd melt all the snow, making it hard to ski here. So they hide the sun away in a crevice so people can ski.
