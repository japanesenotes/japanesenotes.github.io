## Mnemonics
 * If a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> wrap</span>s around itself, the resulting wave will create a lot of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bubbles</span>. You know how tsunamis wrap around once gravity kicks in, right? Well when that wave crashes, a whole lot of bubbles are created.
* Picture the bubbles bursting out of the wrapped up tsunami as it crashes down. The air that the tsunami sucked in while it was wrapping up come out as bubbles big and small.
* One of the biggest <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bubbles</span> heads straight for your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ho</span>me (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほう](https://jisho.org/search/ほう)</span>), engulfs it, and picks it up into the air!
* Watch helplessly as your home, now trapped in a bubble, floats away into the sky.
