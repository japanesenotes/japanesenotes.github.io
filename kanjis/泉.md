## Mnemonics
 * Water from FOUNTAINs is white.<br><br>White <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> water</span> shoots out from a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spring</span> in the ground. Due to the force the water shoots from the spring, the water looks white with all the air bubbles.
* Imagine these geysers and the white water shooting from the springs under the ground. Now imagine yourself standing over one when the water shoots out. You’d get super wet and probably knocked over due to the force of the spring water. Imagine this happening to yourself.
* The only creature powerful enough to withstand the force of these white water <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spring</span>s is the mythical <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> centaur</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span>). His horse body allows him to be stable and withstand the white water shooting up from the spring. Centaurs are pretty impressive creatures.
* Imagine this centaur standing over the white water. It’s just like a shower for him! Hear him laughing with mirth as the whoosh of the spring water washes him down.
