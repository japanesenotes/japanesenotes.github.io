## Mnemonics
 * This <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span> is full of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> car</span>s because it's an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> army base</span>. The cars (and tanks and planes) need to be ready to go at any moment just like the soldiers.
* Picture a giant army base housing all of the different cars the army needs at any given time.
* All of the people in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> army base</span> are wearing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> jean</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じん](https://jisho.org/search/じん)</span>). You thought soldiers were supposed to wear uniforms, but it looks like when they're on the base they have to wear jeans.
* Jeans are pretty durable, now that you think about it. And if the soldiers are working on these cars in the base while they're there, it makes sense to wear a nice pair of jeans.
