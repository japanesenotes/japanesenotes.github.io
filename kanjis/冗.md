## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> forehead</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> table</span> is completely <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> superfluous</span>.
* Seriously, you don't need a forehead table. It's totally unnecessary to have a table made of foreheads and is a superfluous purchase. First of all, getting all those foreheads is a waste of people. Second, forehead tables aren't very strong. Superfluous, superfluous, superfluous.
* The only person you know with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> superfluous</span> forehead table is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Jou</span>rm (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょう](https://jisho.org/search/じょう)</span>), the ten foot tall, simple farmhand. 
* Now that you think about it, it's really odd. You went to his house and saw this forehead table. Then Jourm said, Ah this? It's a superfluous purchase. Don't mind it. You've never heard him say any word above a third grade level, let alone a fancy word such as superfluous. Also, the table made of foreheads is a bit... strange. You'll have to keep your eye on Jourm.
