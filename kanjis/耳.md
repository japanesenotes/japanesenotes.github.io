## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ear</span> radical and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ear</span> kanji are the same in looks as well as meaning.
* Study those radicals hard to make sure you know your kanji as well!
* Put your hand to your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ear</span> and sing... <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Mimi</span>mimimimiiiii! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みみ](https://jisho.org/search/みみ)</span>) and listen to your tone with your ear.
* This is sort of a stereotypical singer sort of image. Make sure you concentrate a lot when you're listening to your mimimimiiii tone. In fact, why don't you do it out loud right now - make a little fool of yourself. It's fun, and it'll help you to remember!
