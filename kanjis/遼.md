## Mnemonics
 * You got off your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> to load some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> charcoal</span> onto it, when it suddenly took off into the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> distance</span>! That's some powerful charcoal.
* Your scooter is charcoal powered, but it looks like you put too much in there and it drove off into the distance without you.
* You chase the scooter into the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> distance</span> when you see it heading for a lake. Oh good, it should be stopped by the water. But wait! In the distance you see your scooter drive onto a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> row</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りょう](https://jisho.org/search/りょう)</span>) boat and... row itself through the water?! No!!
* In the distance you can still make out the shape of your scooter, now on a row boat, fading away and completely out of reach.
