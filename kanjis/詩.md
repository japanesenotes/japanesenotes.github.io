## Mnemonics
 * Special saying = poem<br><br>What you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> at a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> temple</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> poem</span>. It has to be a poem, because if you say anything else it's just plain disrespectful. All of the monks and priests at this temple have to read and recite poems all day, and if they can do it forever, you can while you're visiting.
* Picture all of the people at the temple reciting poems together. You join in too, and it's a really powerful moment!
* As you recite a long <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> poem</span> at the temple you see a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>) in the crowd. It's opening and closing its mouth like it wants to say the poem too.
* You turn to the person next to you and realize you have to say everything in poem form.<br />Excuse me<br />I'm not a creep<br />so hear my plea<br />is that a sheep?
