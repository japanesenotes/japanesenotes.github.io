## Mnemonics
 * If you have <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> seven</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> swords</span>, there's only so much you can do with them. The main thing? Probably using them to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cut</span> something.
* Take these seven swords and swing them around. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Cut</span> everything in your path, including yourself. Then, think about how dumb it was to try to use seven swords at once, and then feel the pain of the cut you gave yourself. Ouch, ouch ouch.
* Because having seven swords for yourself is too much, you decide to take the swords and divide them up amongst pairs of people. You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cut</span> them into pairs, and give <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sets</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せつ](https://jisho.org/search/せつ)</span>) to everyone who needs them in the village.
* Just make sure you think about how you need to give them away in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sets</span>, and not anything else. This is the most important thing to think about in your head as you're trying to establish the mnemonic for your kanji reading memory. It's gotta be sets.
