## Mnemonics
 * There’s a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stone</span>, a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span>, another <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span>, and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> coat rack</span>. That stone and two trees will make the perfect <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foundation</span> for a house to put that coat rack in! This stone is flat and heavy and both of the trees are flexible and durable.
* Imagine making a foundation with the stone and the two trees so you’ll have a place for your coat rack. Feel the wood grain and cold stone against your skin as you move them around to form the foundation.
* After you finish the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foundation</span>, the only step that's left is to wash the entire thing with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> so</span>ap (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そ](https://jisho.org/search/そ)</span>).
* Imagine getting on your hands and knees, rubbing a bar of soap all over the foundation you built. The soap gets into all the nooks and crannies in the wood and stone. Now if a coat falls off the coat rack onto the floor, you just add water and poof! Clean!
