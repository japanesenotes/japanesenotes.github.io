## Mnemonics
 * Try to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> something to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lifeguard</span> and you'll just end up getting a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lecture</span>. 
* A lifeguard's favorite part of the job is telling people what to do, where to swim, when to get out of the water, and they love saying it in a bunch of words.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lecture</span> loving lifeguard is none other than <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>! I mean, look how long winded the stuff on this site is? Can you imagine him trying to give you a talk about proper swimming etiquette?
* Close your eyes and picture <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち]([こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち)</span> lecturing you. Ugh, it's the worst!<br />Hint: when you see the lifeguard radical, the reading is probably going to be <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)</span>.
