## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> you made out of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grain</span>s and are about to ride down the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stairs</span> is completely <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> transparent</span>. You mashed the grains down so fine that you can see through them! And then you made them into a scooter.
* Picture this transparent scooter. Well, it's actually a bit hard to see, because it's see-through. I guess imagine the outline and the feel, as you perch at the top of your stairs.
* You slip, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> transparent</span> scooter scoots down the stairs without you and into the streets of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> とうきょう</span>. Nooo! Transpa-scootie come back!
* Almost immediately you lose track of the scooter because it's transparent. All you see is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span> in front of you. And no scooter. Maybe this is why people don't make transparent vehicles.
