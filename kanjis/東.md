## Mnemonics
 * Behind that <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> is rising in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> east</span>. The sun always rises in the east, so if you head that way, past the tree, you'll be going east too.
* Picture the sun behind the tree, don't picture the sun alone, you'll burn your eyes. It's slowing coming up behind it. Now think: where does the sun rise? In the east!
* You walk <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> east</span> for a few hours until you finally come to a city. It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> とうきょう</span>. Oh! <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span> is in the east. I get it now!
* When you think about East Japan think about <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span>. And if you're bad at geography, just look at a map for a while. Or, stand outside in the morning, watch the sun rise behind the trees, and point that way. That's east, it's where <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span> is!
