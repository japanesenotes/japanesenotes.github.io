## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> came in and buried your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span> so now you have to use a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spoon</span> and dig it out of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mud</span>. The tsunami knocked your flag over and then covered it in mud, so you gotta use your spoon to dig it out.
* Imagine using a spoon to dig your flag outta all this mud. So much mud! Feel its cold, soiled wetness on your hands as you dig away.
* The time of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> day</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [でい](https://jisho.org/search/でい)</span>) is high noon, so the sun soon dries the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mud</span> and makes it harder to dig through. It just might take you all day to spoon your way through this mud.
* Imagine yourself out in the day, continuing to dig through the now hardened mud. Feel your arm getting tired as day slowly turns to night.
