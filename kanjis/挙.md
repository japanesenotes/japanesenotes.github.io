## Mnemonics
 * RAISE = Hand plus some indication of up...<br><br>If there’s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grass</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fins</span> in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hand</span>, you need to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> raise</span> that hand up to the sky. You’re in the middle of a fisherman’s ritual, which can only be performed on grassy ground. You take fish fins from the previous year, and raise them up to the sky in order to ensure a good fishing harvest.
* Feel the grass in your toes and the fins in your hand as you raise them up to the sky. See the sun glistening off the fins as you raise them up in the air.
* This ritual only works in one part of the world however. It absolutely must be performed in Little <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kyo</span>to (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょ](https://jisho.org/search/きょ)</span>). The way Little Kyoto lines up with the sun and the sky and all that astrological junk makes it the best place for you to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> raise</span> fish fins up in the air.
* Imagine yourself going through the same process as before, only this time imagine yourself in Little Kyoto. Little Kyoto is really little, so make sure you're in the right spot.
