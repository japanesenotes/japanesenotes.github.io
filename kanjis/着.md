## Mnemonics
 * Which glasses does the KING with HORNS WEAR to cover his lower EYE? ASLO, WHY IS THE EYE AT THE BOTTOM????<br><br>A cyclops <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span> with one <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eye</span> and great big <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span> slides down a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span> because he wanted to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wear</span> special slide pants. Even though this horned, one eyed king is royalty, he still has to wear the proper safety equipment while on a slide. Luckily, the king enjoys wearing them, so all is well.<br>This word means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> arrive</span> too. Just imagine the king from the mnemonic arriving in his weird clothes to court, and everyone thinking, Why did he arrive wearing that??
* Imagine this one eyed king sliding down the slide wearing all this safety equipment. He’s wearing padded pants, elbow guards, the whole shebang. He looks ridiculous wearing all these things.
* The king <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> arrive</span>s at the bottom of the slide and holds out his hand for some new clothes to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wear</span>. He can't just wear the same thing more than once, you know. But you're out of clothes, so you take out a piece of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chalk</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちゃく](https://jisho.org/search/ちゃく)</span>) and draw the clothes on him. He's like that famous guy who can't see that he isn't really wearing clothes. But this time, they're drawn on with chalk.
* Imagine drawing clothes on the king with chalk so he has something to wear. Eww.
