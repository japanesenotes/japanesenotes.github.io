## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> boat</span> owned by a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Yoga</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> King</span> needs to be able to let him keep doing his exercises while he's on it. That's why his boat is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rowboat</span>, so he can work on his yoga arms as he gets around.
* Picture the Yoga King rowing a rowboat. Maybe he's using his legs. Maybe he's using his butt? You don't know. Yoga people are super flexible, he could be using anything to move this rowboat.
* As he rows the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rowboat</span> with his butt, you see the Yoga King eating something with his toes. They're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ta</span>ter tots (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てい](https://jisho.org/search/てい)</span>). Tater tots are the perfect snack for a rowboat. They're small, delicious, and they float if you drop them in the water.
* Go rent a rowboat and try eating tater tots in it. For fun, throw a bunch of them in the water and watch them float. Maybe you'll catch a fish!
