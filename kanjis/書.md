## Mnemonics
 * Why would you try to take a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> brush</span> to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span>? It's almost too obvious, because you want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> write</span> something down.
* Just imagine yourself sitting on the sun, writing back to your friends and family with a brush. For someone who can visit the sun, it's really weird that you are writing with a brush like this, but you're doing it just the same.
* What did you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> write</span> about? You were writing about this amazing circus <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> show</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょ](https://jisho.org/search/しょ)</span>)you just watched on the sun. You didn't expect there to be any shows here, but turns out you were wrong!
* Think of your favorite live shows and imagine them on the sun. Also imagine yourself writing back to your friends and family about said shows.
