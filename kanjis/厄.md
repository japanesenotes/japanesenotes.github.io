## Mnemonics
 * If you’re on the edge of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cliff</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> snake</span>, you’re <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> unlucky</span>. You’re hanging off the edge of this cliff and you can’t pull yourself back up when you notice a snake approaching your fingers. The snake looks like it’s gonna bite you. How unlucky.
* What will you do? You can either let go and fall off the cliff, or get bit by the snake if you keep holding on. Man, you’re unlucky.
* Even though you’re so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> unlucky</span>, you decide to take your chances and let go of the cliff. Amazingly, a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yak</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [やく](https://jisho.org/search/やく)</span>) runs below you and catches you as you fall. Saved by the yak!
* What a nice yak this is. Perhaps your luck has turned around. Perhaps you aren’t as unlucky as you thought. Your butt sure does hurt from that fall though…
