## Mnemonics
 * If you could just get your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> soul</span> to open the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> window</span> to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span>, you'll grow <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accustomed</span> to them sooner or later! I know shellfish are a bit of an acquired taste, but if you don't open that window, you'll never like them!
* Close your eyes and picture your soul. Now your soul is opening a little window inside of you that is the perfect size for shellfish of all kinds. Hopefully with exposure and acceptance you'll grow accustomed to them.
* You'll need to become <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accustomed</span> to eating shellfish if you want to grow up big and strong like Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>). He didn't have shellfish growing up either you know, he had to grow accustomed to their taste too, but look how successful he was!
* Force yourself to get accustomed to shellfish like Genghis Khan, then maybe you'll rule most of the planet someday.
