## Mnemonics
 * Young people nowadays have an abnormal (looking) <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> life</span>, and they spend their <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> (money) on things I don't like. So I <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blame</span> them for everything that's wrong with the world today!
* Darn those kids and their vidja games and their rap music. I blame them for everything! If they didn't eat so much avocado toasts I'd be able to have another mansion!
* Those who <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> blame</span> everything on the people who live lives they don't recognize also seem to find them <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sexy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せき](https://jisho.org/search/せき)</span>). Which is ridiculous if you think about it. How can you find someone sexy and then also judge everything they do and blame them for things?
* I dunno, I think there might be a lesson somewhere in this mnemonic, but you'll have to look really hard to see it.
