## Mnemonics
 * If you see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> wolverine</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> water</span> playing with a piece of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span>, there’s no doubt that it’s <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> green</span>. Wolverines love green thread. Almost as much as they love the water.
* Picture this wolverine playing with the green thread. It’s like a little kitten with yarn. That wolverine loves that green thread. Picture how cute it is as it plays with the thread and coos in happiness.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Midori</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みどり](https://jisho.org/search/みどり)</span>) is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> green</span> colored melon liqueur with a sweet, fruity taste. This wolverine is too young to drink alcohol like Midori, so he just sticks to drinking water.
* If you’ve ever had Midori before, imagine that taste. It’s also green, so that’s an easy way to remember this kanji. If you haven’t had it, just picture the taste of melon and imagine that flavor on your tongue.
