You can understand everything the people want, and you know how to give it to them because you listen to their hearts so well.
* Close your eyes and open your ears. Feel all of the wise things fill you.
* All of these <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wise</span> things are stored in your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>), not your brain.

* Picture your wise soul, living inside your body. Somehow it just seems to know what the public really wants. It's like your soul is connected to their souls, granting you this wisdom.
