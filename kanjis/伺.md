## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> is also a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> director</span> so you need to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pay respects</span> to him before you can start filming. He’s a huge big-shot and you don’t want to offend him by not paying the proper respects, so you make sure to bow every time you go on stage.
* Imagine bowing really really low as you walk on set. Don’t look him in the eye! He might get upset. Just do as you’re told!
* The name of the director is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ook Aga</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うかが](https://jisho.org/search/うかが)</span>). Ook Aga is a caveman which is why everyone has to be really careful and make sure they <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pay respects</span> to him. Ook Aga doesn’t know how to live in a civilized society so your phones and clothes scare him. You have to bow really low and respect what he says, moving slowly, so that he continues to direct you and won’t run away or hurt anyone.
* Imagine Ook Aga looking down on you and you bow, slowly walking onto the stage. Oh no, your cell phone is ringing. He’s grunting Ook Aga Ook Aga and looking around angrily. Quick, put it away and pay your respects harder!! Bow, BOW!
