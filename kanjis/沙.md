## Mnemonics
 * People think <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span>s are only made of water but they have a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> few</span> pieces of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sand</span> in there too. There's actually more sand in the ocean than most people think. And tsunamis can't just have water and sharks in them. A few grains of sand will always slip in.
* Imagine how those few grains of sand feel to get swept up into a tsunami. They didn't ask for this. They just wanted to stay at the bottom of the sea.
* How do I know there's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sand</span> in there? Because I <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> saw</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)</span>) them! 
* I saw the sand, stop doubting me!
