## Mnemonics
 * This <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> odd</span>, but that's what makes it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beautiful</span>. It's a little frayed, it's a little miscolored, but that's what makes it appealing to you.
* If something is a bit odd, it's usually beautiful in its own way, just like this beautiful thread.
* You take this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beautiful</span> thread and lock it up with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>). You want to keep it all to yourself, you want its beauty to be for your eyes only!
* To remember that there's a beautiful thread hidden away, you tie a not-as-beautiful thread to the end of the key.
