## Mnemonics
 * If someone tries to dig up <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> private</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> on you, tell them no thanks, that stuff is in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> past</span>. Some things should stay in the past. Not everyone needs to know everything about your life and your past.
* Keep your private dirt in the past. It's better for everyone.
* To remember the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょ](https://jisho.org/search/きょ)</span>, we'll use Little Kyoto. This will differentiate <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょ](https://jisho.org/search/きょ)</span> from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょ](https://jisho.org/search/きょ)う</span>, which is regular-sized Kyoto. Get it? You decide to bury all this private dirt from your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> past</span> in Little <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kyo</span>to (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょ](https://jisho.org/search/きょ)</span>). That stuff is from when you were just a little <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 子</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span>) and you don't like to think about it.
* Imagine physically, literally burying your past <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span> self. If you hide it in Little Kyoto, no one will ever be able to dig it up.
