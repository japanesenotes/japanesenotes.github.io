* Tying two fingers together with a good luck thread is very common where you're from.
* After you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bind</span> your fingers, the good luck starts pouring in. Literally. Suddenly <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ketsu</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けつ](https://jisho.org/search/けつ)</span>) starts pouring down from the heavens.
* This ketsup is exactly what you were looking for, but now it won't stop. You need to get out of this bind by untying the thread on your finger. But it won't budge. It's covered in ketsup. Help! You're going to drown!
