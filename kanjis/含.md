## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Now</span> your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> include</span> more words than ever before! With our new and improved “Mouth Now!” program, your mouth will include more words than you ever thought possible!
* Imagine how your repertoire of new words will impress all your friends and family. Don’t include them on your secret that you used the Mouth Now! program, just feel super smart with all the words you now know.
* If you buy now, we’ll also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> include</span> a handful of books by <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Gan</span>dhi (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がん](https://jisho.org/search/がん)</span>) himself. Gandhi didn’t use our program, but we’re sure if he’d had the opportunity to, he would have used it. So buy now, and get the words of Gandhi in your hands as well as your mouth!
* Since you bought the program, you also got the Gandhi books included with your order. Imagine yourself reading them and learning all about non-violent resistance. Fascinating.
