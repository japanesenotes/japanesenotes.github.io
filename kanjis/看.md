## Mnemonics
 * Put your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hand</span> over your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eye</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> watch over</span> others.
* You know that way cartoon characters and pirates watch out below them, with their hand shading their eye? That! Now imagine doing that right now.
* As you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> watch over</span> your friends and neighbors you see movement in the distance. Oh no, it's Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>) and his army!
* Welp, nothing much watching over them will do now. Genghis Khan is probably going to take over your town, so I guess you can watch if you want but... I wouldn't.
