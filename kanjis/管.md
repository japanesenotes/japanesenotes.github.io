## Mnemonics
 * On your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bamboo</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bear</span>. It is pulling the bamboo off, because it wants to use it to make a long <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pipe</span>.
* Bamboo is great for pipes, and the only place for the bear to get it is your roof. So, that's why it's there.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pipe</span> will be for Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>), who would like some pipes for his house.
* Watch the bear take away your bamboo. Follow it to Genghis Khan's house. There, the bear installs the pipe in Genghis Khan's bathroom.
