## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> master</span> has the power to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pour</span> water wherever he pleases. Tsunami masters are masters over the most powerful water force in the universe, so it makes sense that they have the ability to pour water at will, wherever they please. Best not tick off the master, unless you want a tsunami poured on your head.
* Picture yourself as this tsunami master. You’re like a water bender from Avatar, only more awesome. Feel the cold wet water pouring out of your fingertips as you create water out of nothing. Imagine what it would be like to have this power.
* If <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chew</span>bacca (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちゅう](https://jisho.org/search/ちゅう)</span>) was trying to attack you, you’d be able to defend yourself easily. Simply <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pour</span> a tsunami on him and Chewbacca would surrender in a heartbeat. Chewbacca doesn’t like having water poured on him, especially not all the water from a tsunami.
* Imagine Chewbacca soaking wet. All his fur is matted down and he looks pretty depressed. He smells like wet dog too. Smell this smell in your nostrils as you imagine how pathetic this drenched Chewbacca feels.
