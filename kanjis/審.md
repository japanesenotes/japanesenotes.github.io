## Mnemonics
 * You're about to enter a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> that has your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> number</span> on it so you can face the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> judge</span>. You've been sitting here for what feels like hours, waiting for your number to come up. Finally the time has come—the judge will see you now.
* Picture the judge sitting under the roof. Your number is sitting on his big desk, next to the gavel.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> judge</span> is not happy with you. He tells you to come closer and when you do, he takes his gavel and hits you in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shin</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しん](https://jisho.org/search/しん)</span>). Ouch!
* You try to ask the judge what his ruling is, but he just hits you on the shins again!
