## Mnemonics
 * You go to buy a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> table</span> but it looks it has water damage from <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span>s of water hitting it. This makes it a pretty <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mediocre</span> table. The water drops haven't really damaged it that much, it still stands and you can use it, but it's kinda ugly, so it's just mediocre.
* You didn't expect to see water drop damage on this table so now your mood is mediocre too.
* You weren't expecting to see such a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mediocre</span> table so you go up to the guy who's selling it and say, Hey, I have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bone</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼん](https://jisho.org/search/ぼん)</span>) to pick with you! But he doesn't think there is a bone to pick at all, he doesn't think the table is mediocre like you do.
* Imagine having a bone to pick with someone because they're trying to sell you something mediocre and they just won't listen. Now you have a bone to pick with the person who recommended this guy to you!
