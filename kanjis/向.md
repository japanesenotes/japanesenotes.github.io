## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> hits your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> head</span> and goes into your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span>. Where did it come from? Ah, it came from <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yonder</span>, you say, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> facing</span> that way.
* Yonder is a bit of a weird word, but it fits the meaning of this kanji quite well. You'll have to trust me that it's more useful in Japanese than it is in English. When you imagine through this mnemonic, make sure the drop comes from the side and hits you in the head with quite a bit of force. That means it came from a far distance thus making you look over yonder.
* Who shot this drop at you from <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yonder</span>? You look over yonder, and see a figure. It is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>.
* Who is that over yonder! you yell.<br />It is I, (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span>), he yells back. I shot at you over yonder because you weren't doing your kanji reviews often enough and you're taking up space on our database.<br />But I'm paying you!<br />Oh, that's true. Well, I'm going to walk over yonder and leave you alone, then.
