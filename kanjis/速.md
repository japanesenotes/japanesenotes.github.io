## Mnemonics
 * <br>If you find a bundle of money on the road, pick it up<strong>&nbsp;quick</strong>&nbsp;before anyone notices.<br><br>You jump on your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> with a big <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bundle</span> to go as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fast</span> as you can! You have a bundle of pizzas in here, and they need to be delivered as fast as you can get them there!
* Imagine how fast you can go on your scooter holding this bundle. It's way faster than trying to go on foot, that's for sure!
* You were going so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fast</span>, you only put on <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sock</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そく](https://jisho.org/search/そく)</span>). So now you're barreling down the street at top speeds in just your sad, white socks.
* Imagine riding the scooter as fast as you can in just your socks. You can feel the wind pulling them off your feet!
