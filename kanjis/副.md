## Mnemonics
 * That <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scarecrow</span> with the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> vice</span> president. Yeah, I know how he looks, and I'm pretty sure he does some murdering on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> side</span>, but you didn't hear that from me.
* I don't know how we managed to get a knife-wielding scarecrow as a vice president, there's a side of politics I don't get, I guess. I mean, just look at him up there. If something happens to our president we're stuck with that thing.
* It's the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> vice</span> president's turn to speak at the podium and he just clears his throat and yells, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> F**k</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふく](https://jisho.org/search/ふく)</span>) you! to the crowd, holding up his knife. They cheer.
* What's going on? Normally if a vice president yells f**k you there would be... I dunno... consequences? What's happening?!
