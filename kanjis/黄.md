## Mnemonics
 * The radical <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> yellow</span> and the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yellow</span> are exactly the same!
* 
* You're in a room, surrounded completely by <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yellow</span>. You can't get out. Somewhere in the room is a yellow <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>) but you can't find it, because everything looks the same. You crawl around trying to find this tiny thing so that you can escape.
* The walls are coming in closer, too. Make sure you feel a bit of peril as you look for this key. The walls have a slight opening at the bottom too, so if you don't find it before the wall goes over it, the key will be lost forever, and you'll be smushed!
