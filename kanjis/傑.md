## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> does a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dance</span> on top of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> to show his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> greatness</span> to everyone around. If he dances all the way up there on top of the tree, then no one can deny his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> excellence</span>!
* Look upon your leader's greatness! he shouts, doing a jig around on the branches.
* If you don't recognize the leader's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> greatness</span> he will throw <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ketsu</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けつ](https://jisho.org/search/けつ)</span>) all over you (it's a special mix of ketchup and catsup). And it's ketsup because it looks like blood. The blood he'll spill if you don't look up and clap at his great dancing.
* Oh leader, your greatness is so... great! you shout up at him. He's holding the ketsup bottle over your head and staring into your eyes as he dances in the tree. He isn't sure if he wants to dump it on you yet. He isn't sure if you really recognize his excellence.
