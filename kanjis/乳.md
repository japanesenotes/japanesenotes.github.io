## Mnemonics
 * Giving <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cleats</span> to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> child</span> carrying an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> umbrella</span> is the best way to gather <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> milk</span>. You don’t have any containers, so the child has to hold milk in the upside-down umbrella. The cleats are so the child can run back and forth to transport the milk around.
* See this child running in his cleats. Picture him holding the umbrella upside-down, milk sloshing all about as he runs.
* But where is this child exactly? He’s in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> New</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にゅう](https://jisho.org/search/にゅう)</span>) York City. What’s he doing in New York City you ask? Well, he's milking a cow. Why is there a cow to be milked in New York City? Good question. It’s the end of the world and New York City is the last remaining civilization. This is how people live now. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Milk</span> is important.
* Imagine post-apocalyptic New York City. Milk is a hot commodity here so it’s important not to spill any of the milk. Imagine yourself carrying the milk in the umbrella and being careful not to spill any of it.
