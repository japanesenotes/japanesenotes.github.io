## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> loiter</span>ing <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mountain</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> is an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> indication</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sign</span> of something to come.
* We don't want to focus too much on what the indication / sign actually is, though, because it will take away from the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> indication</span> part (which we want to remember). So, focus on the fact that this is some kind of indication that's important, but you don't know what that indication means or is... because we'll use that with the reading.
* When you spot a loitering mountain king in the winter, you know it's an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> indication</span> that soon Mrs. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chou</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょう](https://jisho.org/search/ちょう)</span>) will appear. It's like a Groundhog's Day kind of situation, but instead it means Mrs. Chou is about to come out, perhaps early for the season.
* Imagine an announcer watching the loitering mountain king, There he is... and it's still winter. We all know what that means. It's a sign that Mrs. Chou will be coming out of hibernation soon. Then, you can imagine her bursting forth from the mountain, running down her street.
