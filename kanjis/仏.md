 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> private</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Buddha</span>. You don't feel the need to tell everyone. But when you're alone you give your time to Buddha and let him lead your life.
* Imagine being in the privacy of your own home, your own room, and saying to yourself, Yes Buddha, you're my leader.<br />Or, if that irks you, don't. Your religion is your own private right, yo.

Your Buddha is wearing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boots</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶつ](https://jisho.org/search/ぶつ)</span>). They're big and rubber, and they look fabulous on him.
