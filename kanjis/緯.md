## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> that goes through <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Korea</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> latitude</span> line splitting up North and South Korea.
* Why thread? Back in the old days globes were sewn together with cloth and thread, so there was a literal thread dividing the Koreas!<br />Or you can just picture an actual, super long piece of thread going around the entire globe. That works too.
* The only way you can see this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> latitude</span> line is to ride an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>) over it. The line isn't visible from a car, you're too close, and a plane is too high. You have to see it from an eagle's point of view.
* Imagine being an eagle yourself, flying around the entire globe, following the latitude line that splits Korea down the middle.
