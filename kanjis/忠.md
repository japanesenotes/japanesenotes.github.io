## Mnemonics
 * Those that are in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> middle</span> of your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span> are the ones you have the most <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> loyalty</span> towards. The middle of your heart is the most sacred, special place for people, so it makes sense that those you keep in the middle of your heart are those you are most loyal to.
* Who do you feel the most loyalty towards? Imagine them in the middle of your heart. Feel them in your chest. Imagine them, literally inside the middle of your heart.
* You pictured <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chew</span>bacca (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちゅう](https://jisho.org/search/ちゅう)</span>), didn’t you? No? Well you should have. Chewbacca deserves everyone’s <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> loyalty</span>. Chewbacca is super loyal to you, so he deserves your loyalty back.
* Chewbacca is very loyal. Focus on your loyalty to Chewbacca. Picture him right in the middle of your heart and hear his Chewbacca yell. Also keep in mind that this kanji shares its reading with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [中](https://jisho.org/search/中)</span> which is also included in this kanji.
