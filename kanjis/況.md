## Mnemonics
 * There’s a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> coming and your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> older brother</span> is in no <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> condition</span> to escape. Your older brother has brittle bone syndrome so there’s no way he’ll be able to escape the tsunami in time in his condition.
* Imagine your poor brother and the condition he is in. His glass bones and paper skin make it impossible for him to move very fast. Imagine the sad face he makes when he realizes his fate.
* His <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> condition</span> gets worse and you have to travel all the way to his home in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> きょうと</span> to get him out.
* This is also, incidentally, where the tsunami's condition is the worst, so you better get to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょうと](https://jisho.org/search/きょうと)</span> quick!
