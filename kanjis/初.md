## Mnemonics
 * If you want a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spirit</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sword</span>, you have to be the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> first</span> one to find it. Do you really think the first person to come across a spirit sword wouldn't want it?! No. So if you're any place but first, you're not getting anything.
* Imagine it like commenting on Youtube or Facebook. If you can say FIRST, first, well congrats. You win the internet spirit sword.
* If you were lucky enough to be the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> first</span> one to find the spirit sword, you should open up a small <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> show</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょ](https://jisho.org/search/しょ)</span>) to show it off! And then you can make yourself the first in line every day to see the show.
* This is the first show of this type, anywhere in the world!
