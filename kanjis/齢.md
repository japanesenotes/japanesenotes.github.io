## Mnemonics
 * You get <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tooth</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> orders</span>. You get these tooth orders various times in your life, depending on your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> age</span>.
* You get baby age tooth orders (to get your first teeth). You get child age tooth orders (to get your adult teeth). Then you get old age tooth orders (when you start loosing your teeth). There are tooth orders for every age.
* Gaining and losing teeth aren't the only things dependent on <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> age</span>. There is also an age in which you get your first <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ray</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れい](https://jisho.org/search/れい)</span>) gun.
* Decide what age you have to be to get your first ray gun, and then imagine getting it when you hit that age. Perhaps you use this ray gun on your teeth, to keep them clean.<br />Hint: when you see the radical <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> orders</span> it's fairly likely the reading will be <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れい](https://jisho.org/search/れい)</span>.
