## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Dry</span> an already <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dry</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> to create a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bookmark</span>. The more you dry the tree, the flatter it becomes, making it the perfect way to mark your spot in a book without needing to fold a page or write on it.
* To be fair, books are just dry trees in a way, but bookmarks are actually dry, dry trees that have flattened out and turned into chunks.
* What are you bookmarking anyway? Look down and see yourself putting one of the tree <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bookmark</span>s on a page in your notebook that says <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> She owe</span>s me <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ree</span>ds (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しおり](https://jisho.org/search/しおり)</span>). Oh yeah, you had to make this bookmark in the first place because your friend took your reed bookmarks and didn't give them back.
* What does she owe you? Open the page to your bookmark and see she owes reeds!
