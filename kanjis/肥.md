 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> who stays in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bed</span> all day every day will soon become <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> obese</span>. A healthy moon needs movement and exercise to stay fit and not become obese. If a moon stays in bed all day, they’ll be sure to grow obese over time.
* Imagine this moon in bed, slowly getting bigger and bigger, becoming more obese every day. Hear the sound of the bed creaking and cracking as the moon grows larger and larger.
* But once the moon gets <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> obese</span> enough, he turns into a super <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> he</span>ro (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひ](https://jisho.org/search/ひ)</span>)! He is, super obese moon! The most obese hero in all of history.
* Imagine super obese moon the super hero. His powers are rolling and sitting on things. See super obese moon in his little cape and marvel at the fact that he’s even capable of movement.
