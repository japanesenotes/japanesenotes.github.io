## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hole</span> leading to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> private</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span> of your house is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> window</span>. Or maybe it's just the window to your soul, and not your house. Like the poetry people say.
* Imagine someone looking into a hole that shows your private heart. That's a window. A window you probably should have kept closed. Now everyone is looking in.
* You realize that a ton of people are looking into your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> window</span> and seeing all your private things. This makes you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mad</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まど](https://jisho.org/search/まど)</span>)! What right do they have to know your private thoughts and desires?!
* Look out your window back at the faces. Try to express how mad you are at them with your face through the glass. Make as many mad faces that you can think of.
