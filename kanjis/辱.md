## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> landslide</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> measurement</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> humiliate</span>s you. You told everyone you couldn't come to work, that your house had been destroyed and your car was carried away, but then scientists measured the landslide, and it only went a few feet.
* Honestly, that's what you get for lying. But it doesn't make it any less humiliating even if you deserve it.
* Your friends and coworkers <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> humiliate</span> you more by making <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> joke</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょく](https://jisho.org/search/じょく)</span>). Uh oh, I heard it might rain later, I hope you don't drown in the inch of water that's coming!
* Imagine all of the cruel jokes people say to humiliate you. Feel your face burn and your stomach flip.
