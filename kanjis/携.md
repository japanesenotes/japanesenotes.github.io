## Mnemonics
 * Use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> to shoo a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> down the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stairs</span> and into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> portable</span> carrier. You've been trying to get this turkey into the carrier so you can transport it for like, the past hour. You finally got it done with the help of gravity. And, you know, smacking it a bit in the butt with your fingers.
* Turkeys aren't portable on their own. I mean you could pick one up I guess, but it will bite and poop on you. So get it in a portable carrier first.
* You needed the turkey to be more <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> portable</span> because you're going to be bringing it to a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>ke (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けい](https://jisho.org/search/けい)</span>) shop to turn it into a cake. You aren't cooking it! Geez, what's wrong with you? No, you're making a cake OF it, for its birthday. The baker needs to see it for reference.
* Imagine getting a portable turkey cake made of your pet turkey. It's made of turkey friendly cake mix.
