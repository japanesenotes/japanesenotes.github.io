## Mnemonics
 * The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> book</span> first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> book</span> as well.<br />Take note that the second, third, and fourth meanings of this kanji are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> origin</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> real</span>, and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> main</span>. You can figure this out by thinking about how books mainly have their origins in real life.
* Make sure you know those radicals, yo! And good luck with all the meanings (sorry sorry sorry).
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Book</span>s are one of the best ways to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hone</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほん](https://jisho.org/search/ほん)</span>) your intellect, you know?
* Just think about books and how you use them to hone your skills. Or read a book about honing things. Like swords.
