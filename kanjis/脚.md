## Mnemonics
 * If you've been to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> past</span>, you had to get the special <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stamp</span> on your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> leg</span>.
* This leg stamp not only proved you went, but lets everyone around you know you've been to the moon before!
* You've only met one other person with the same mark on their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> leg</span> and it was <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kyaku</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きゃく](https://jisho.org/search/きゃく)</span>) the customer. Kyaku visits many places all over the world, so it only makes sense that they've also been off-world too.
* Picture Kyaku lifting up their pant leg and showing you all the stamps from all the different places they've been. There are even some planets on there!
