## Mnemonics
 * You see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> helicopter</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> jackhammer</span> tied to it. You look closer, because this is an odd sight, and realize that there is a sign here too. It's telling you to beware of helicopters and jackhammers in this woods. It's a poorly made <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> signpost</span>!
* This is not the best signpost you've ever seen, but it's better than nothing at all, you suppose.
* As you look at this weird <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> signpost</span> you notice a button. You press it because it will supposedly tell you more about these dangerous helicopters and jackhammers. Instead, it just yells out in a loud obnoxious voice: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> HEYO</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひょう](https://jisho.org/search/ひょう)</span>)!!
* Press it a few more times and hear the sound in your head. Also spell it out in kana as you hear it as a nice little additional visual.
