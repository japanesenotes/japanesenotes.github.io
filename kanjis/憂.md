* Their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grief</span> intensifies because all of the foreheads they lost belonged to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> you</span>ths (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆう](https://jisho.org/search/ゆう)</span>). Dead youths everywhere. Now there's no one left to repopulate the world.
