## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Viking</span> who knows how to use a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bathtub</span> will have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> manage</span> all the baths for the other Vikings. Vikings aren't so great with bathing... if you can get one Viking to figure it out he has to manage the rest of them.
* Picture a Viking trying to manage his Viking friends so they'll use the bathtub properly. He has to manage which people go in when, how hot or cold the water is, and provide all the soap. It's a very important job.
* The poor Viking trying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> manage</span> all the others keeps having to confiscate <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a</span>corns (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [えい](https://jisho.org/search/えい)</span>). You can't take baths in acorns and wood, it has to be water! he shouts.
* Some of the Vikings managed to fill their bathtubs with acorns and are trying to rub themselves clean with them instead of water...
