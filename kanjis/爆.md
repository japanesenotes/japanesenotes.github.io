## Mnemonics
 * If you combine <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fire</span> with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> violence</span>, it will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> explode</span>! A fire, once full of violence, will surely explode. The fire can’t handle all that violence so the fire just rumbles and shakes and then finally explodes. BOOM!
* Imagine the fire explode. Feel the heat of the fire and the explosion. It’s very violent. BOOM BOOM BA-BOOM!
* As you watch the fire <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> explode</span>, you start to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> back</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばく](https://jisho.org/search/ばく)</span>) away. I don’t blame you. You need to back away or else you’ll get caught in the violent explosion. Back away a little more just to be safe.
* Imagine yourself as you back away from the explosion. As you back away, see the fire dance and feel the heat of the explosion on your face.
