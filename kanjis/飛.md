## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fly</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fly</span> kanji are exactly the same! Awesome!
* 
* When you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fly</span>, you generate a lot of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> he</span>at (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひ](https://jisho.org/search/ひ)</span>) because you’re moving so fast through the atmosphere. Normally this heat would be a nuisance, but you’re a superhero so it doesn’t bother you. This is actually the reason you’re able to fly – you’re a superhero and super resistant to heat.
* You’re flying through the air super fast. Feel the air rushing past you as heat builds up all over your body from rocketing through the air so fast.
