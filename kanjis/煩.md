## Mnemonics
 * Set <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fire</span> to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> geoduck</span> if you want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> annoy</span> it. Fire won't kill a geoduck, but have you ever been on fire? It's not really pleasant. So you'll just annoy it pretty badly.
* Imagine how annoyed you would be if someone set YOU on fire for no reason. The geoduck has every reason to find you annoying, dude.
* You know who loves <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> annoying</span> geoducks more than anyone else in the universe? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Han</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はん](https://jisho.org/search/はん)</span>) Solo! If you watch Star Wars closely enough you can see him shooting geoducks with his blaster and catching them on fire for fun. 
* Think how annoying it must be to be a geoduck when Han Solo comes around.
