## Mnemonics
 * The self radical is a bit modified, with things sticking out, but that’s because it’s falling down a slide.<br />Sure, it’s your<span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> self</span> who’s tumbling down the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span>… at least that’s how it feels to you. Who are you? What are you? All you know is you’re <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> somebody</span>, but you don’t know who that somebody is.
* Apparently, you’re having some kind of internal crisis. Come up with a rough one and you’ll remember this kanji better.
* You’re falling down this metaphorical slide… And then you hit something… and you hit it really hard. It’s your metaphorical <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shin</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しん](https://jisho.org/search/しん)</span>). You split it in half and it’s at a right angle. The pain is incredible (shins have a lot of nerves!). It may have been broken, and you may not be able to walk correctly again… metaphorically speaking, that is.
* Just make the tumble and shin hit as painful as possible in your imagination and you’ll surely remember this kanji’s on’yomi.
