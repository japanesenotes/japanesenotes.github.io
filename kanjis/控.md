## Mnemonics
 * Raise your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sky</span> to symbolize that you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> abstain</span> from something. If someone offers you fur coats, raise your fingers to abstain. If someone tries to get you to bully someone, raise your fingers to abstain.
* Abstaining from doing what other people are doing is important sometimes. So make sure you never forget the universal abstaining symbol.
* This symbol to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> abstain</span> comes from the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hica</span>tee (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひか](https://jisho.org/search/ひか)</span>) turtle. The hicatee is a Central American river turtle hunted for its meat, eggs, and shell. Therefore, the poor hicatee is endangered. So people started to rally around it, abstaining from hurting them anymore. They raised their fingers to the sky and shouted, I abstain from harming this hicatee!
* Picture yourself in Central America. Standing in the water, blocking poachers from the hicatee turtles. Abstain! you shout at them.
