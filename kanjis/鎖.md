## Mnemonics
 * The famous <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gold</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> triceratops</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> is good for only one thing, and that's being made into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chain</span>s. They link their triceratops horns together and form an unbreakable gold chain. You can't eat them, because they're gold. So they're only really good for their chaining together ability.
* Picture these little gold triceratops shellfish linked together by their horns in a chain around your neck. Feel them hanging there. Sparkly and cold.
* However, the only way to break the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chain</span> is to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> saw</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)</span>) it open. Once the triceratops shellfish start holding on, they never let go. So when you want to take the chain off you have to really hack at it with your saw.
* Picture the saw in your hands, sawing back and forth on the gold chain around your neck. Maybe this isn't the best fashion accessory if you have to use a saw to get it off.
