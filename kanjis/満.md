## Mnemonics
 * If a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> hits these <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> they'll <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> both</span> become <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> full</span> of water. Tsunamis carry a lot of water, definitely enough to make both of these flowers full.
* Picture both of these little flowers, happily swaying in the breeze. Then the tsunami comes, leaves, and you look back and their little cup-heads are full to the brim with water.
* As you stare at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> full</span> flowers, you decide to write a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> man</span>ga (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まん](https://jisho.org/search/まん)</span>) about them. Your head is full of manga ideas!
* Soon you have full color pages, full of stories about both of these tsunami-filled flowers and their adventures together. And when you're done, your heart is full as well. Awwww.
