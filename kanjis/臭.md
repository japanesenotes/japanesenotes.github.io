## Mnemonics
 * In German there is the saying self praise stinks (Eigenlob stinkt). So, making yourself 自 look big 大 stinks.<br><br>Wash your<span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> self</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> big</span> bar of soap if you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stinking</span> everything up.
* Seriously. If you or someone else is stinking to high heaven, embrace a big bar of self care.
* You're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stinking</span> up the room because you spent your day rolling in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 草</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くさ](https://jisho.org/search/くさ)</span>). And based on this particular stench, I'd say an animal left something in that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [草](https://jisho.org/search/草)</span> too...
* Imagine trying to use a big bar of soap on yourself to get the stinky <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [草](https://jisho.org/search/草)</span> off. But it's not working... the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [草](https://jisho.org/search/草)</span> stink is SO STRONG!
