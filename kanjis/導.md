## Mnemonics
 * Take a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> measurement</span> of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> road</span>. Hmm. It seems a bit too long. As you measure it, you continue down this road, wondering where it will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lead</span> you.
* Roads are really long, so I imagine it would take a long time to measure it (if you want to go from end to end). Imagine yourself pulling a tape measure along with you, all the while thinking, where will this lead me?
* Where does the road that you're measuring <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lead</span> you? An awesome <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dou</span>ghnut (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [どう](https://jisho.org/search/どう)</span>) shop!
* What a perfect way to end this road measuring. You're hungry. Nom nom nom. Imagine eating your fill, and taste the donuts in your mouth. You just walked a long ways!
