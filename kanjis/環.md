* Watch as the king loops the net around and around and around the zombie, keeping it completely pinned down.
* The king also explains that this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> loop</span> technique was used by Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>) when he was conquering cities. He'd loop around the entire place with a net and trap them.
* Picture Genghis Khan looping around and around just like the king is looping around and around this zombie.
