## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> woman</span> sleeps with the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span> and becomes <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pregnant</span>. Only the king wasn’t human and now the woman is pregnant with a hybrid alien baby!
* The king radical is slightly altered in this kanji, so just remember that the king is a strange alien and not human. Imagine being this woman and having this half-breed alien baby inside you. Feels weird.
* Being <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pregnant</span> with this strange creature, you need to do something to calm you down. You should play <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Nin</span>tendo (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にん](https://jisho.org/search/にん)</span>). Nintendo really calms your nerves and makes being pregnant with some mutant baby not seem like that big of a deal anymore.
* What game are you playing on the Nintendo? Maybe it’s a game where you kill alien invaders? That’s messed up.
