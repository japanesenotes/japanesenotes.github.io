## Mnemonics
 * The radical for <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gate</span> and the kanji for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gates</span> are the same!
* Know your radicals or you won't be allowed to pass.
* You're standing in front of some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gates</span>. You can't get through them, but on the other side you hear all kinds of loud <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> moan</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もん](https://jisho.org/search/もん)</span>). Are those zombie noises? Is this gate to keep the zombies out, or in?
* They start pounding on the gate, and it begins to budge. Focus in on their moaning noises, because that's the reading of this kanji, but also feel the fear as well. When you start moaning too, it seems to calm them. Go ahead and pretend you're in front of this gate, and moan out loud for me a bit. Uwhhhhhh. Muhehwhhhhhhh.
