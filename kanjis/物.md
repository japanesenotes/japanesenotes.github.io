## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> wing</span>ed <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cow</span> is flying in the air. What a strange <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thing</span>! You’ve heard of flying pigs before, but cows? This is a new and strange thing indeed! Cows with wings! What a silly thing to imagine.
* Imagine if cows could fly. Wouldn’t you be jealous of them? I mean, if a cow can fly, any old thing should be able to, right?
* You want a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thing</span> to help you fly with the cow so you put on your flying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boots</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶつ](https://jisho.org/search/ぶつ)</span>). Your flying boots are a pretty strange thing in themselves, but they're the only way you can keep up.
* Imagine a thing like flying boots. Do you believe such a thing could be real?
