## Mnemonics
 * You have an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> animal</span> for a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> husband</span> with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span> that are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> narrow</span>. This animal husband of yours is a goat. A goat with narrow horns. Why is this animal your husband? You’re weird, that’s why.
* Imagine yourself married to this animal husband with horns that are narrow. It’s a strange marriage. Listen to the goat making its goat noises as it clomps around your home. Now hug your goat husband and feel its soft fluffy coat against your skin.
* I’m not even going to get into the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sema</span>ntics (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せま](https://jisho.org/search/せま)</span>) of how this weird relationship of yours works. Nope, this reading explanation is on the straight and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> narrow</span>. Need to know basis. Classified. All that junk. There will be no discussion of the semantics between you and your goat lover.
* But that doesn’t mean you can’t imagine the semantics. The finer points of the relationship. Go ahead, imagine all the weird stuff that comes with the territory for having a goat as a husband. Use all that weird stuff to remember this kanji and its reading. Want an example? Just imagine the goat doing dishes! Goats don’t have hands! Hahahahaha!!
