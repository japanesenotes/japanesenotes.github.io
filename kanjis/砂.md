## Mnemonics
 * If you grind a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stone</span> down to more than just a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> few</span> pieces, it will become <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sand</span>. Stones that get broken up enough will become sand, and you pick up a few grains in your hand.
* Feel these few grains of sand between your fingertips. Imagine the stones that they originally came from. Nature is crazy.
* What’s in your hand? A few grains of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sa</span>nd (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)</span>)! <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Sand</span>, sand, sand!
* Just remember that stones become sand and if you remember that this kanji means sand you’ll remember how to pronounce it as well.
