## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> circumference</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> circumference</span> kanji are the same!
* Know your radicals, yo!
* Practice how to measure the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> circumference</span> of an item by using your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shoe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅう](https://jisho.org/search/しゅう)</span>). Your shoe is kind of round, and it's free. I mean it's right there on your foot.
* Try to find the circumference of your shoe and then email us with the measurement. I promise you'll never forget this kanji if you actually do it.
