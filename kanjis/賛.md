 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> husband</span> and his <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> husband</span> find a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> agree</span> to share it.
* Picture the husbands pulling a different side of the shellfish, it pops in two, and they each get a shell. They smile and high five.
* Since the husbands were able to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> agree</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> San</span>ta-san (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さん](https://jisho.org/search/さん)</span>) believes they’re both good husbands and belong on the good list. Therefore, Santa-san gives them each lots and lots of shellfish for Christmas.
* Imagine Santa-san flying over the husbands in his sleigh, raining shellfish down upon them from the sky. It warms the heart, wouldn’t you agree?
