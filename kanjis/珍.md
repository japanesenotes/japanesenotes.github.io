## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span>'s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hat</span>, not to mention the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hair</span> stuck to said hat, is incredibly <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rare</span>. If you have your hands on either of these things, you'll be a rich duck.
* Imagine yourself holding a king's hat covered in his hair. Who will you sell it to? This is such a rare item!
* Then you look closer at the hat. It's about to get even <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rare</span>r. Attached to the hair is the king's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chin</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちん](https://jisho.org/search/ちん)</span>).
* Not sure how it got there, but you'll make a pretty penny from this. The king only had one chin, so that's about as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rare</span> as they come.
