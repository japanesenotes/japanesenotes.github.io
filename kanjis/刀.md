## Mnemonics
 * The radical and the meaning of this kanji are almost the same! The radical is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sword</span>, but we're learning Japanese, so can you name a Japanese <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sword</span>? That's right, the most common is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> katana</span>, which happens to be the meaning of this kanji as well.
* The progression on this one is important. When you think sword you have to think, What kinds of swords do Japanese people have? Then you'll reach the meaning of this kanji on your own.
* So now you have this sweet <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> katana</span> in your hands and you're swinging it around like an idiot. Feel free to make whooshing noises as you swing it around. To become a master katana wielder, you decide to travel to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> とうきょう</span> (That's Tokyo!). <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span> has the best sword and katana schools in the world, so it makes sense to travel to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span>.
* Imagine trying to travel to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とうきょう](https://jisho.org/search/とうきょう)</span> with your katana. Airport security is not happy with you trying to take a katana on the plane, so you get a full cavity search. I hope you don't have any other swords hidden anywhere.
