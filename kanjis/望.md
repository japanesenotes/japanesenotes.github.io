## Mnemonics
 * DEATH star, more like DEATH MOON, you should know this is from Star Wars: A New&nbsp;HOPE<br><br>Causing <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> death</span> at every turn, the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span> sits inside his moon, getting ready to cause death on anything in his sights. Sounds a lot like the Death Star from a certain movie. One of which is Star Wars: A New <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Hope</span>.
* Now picture the death moon king as the Emperor, sitting in his Death Star. There is no hope, except for that little opening you can shoot through to destroy the whole thing. That's hope, I guess!
* The name A New <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Hope</span>, as we all know, comes from the ending where the moon king's son sends a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bow</span>ling (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼう](https://jisho.org/search/ぼう)</span>) ball into that little opening and knocks it out of the sky.
* In the end, the real hope was bowling all along. I hope you've learned a valuable lesson from this space movie.
