## Mnemonics
 * You see an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> animal</span> with some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span> trying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seize</span> them. The animal with the flowers is really tall so the turkey needs to stand on the stool in its attempt to seize the flowers.
* Look at this turkey straining itself on the stool trying to seize the flowers, grunting with effort. You think he’ll ever get them?
* The animal the turkey is trying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seize</span> the flowers from is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かく](https://jisho.org/search/かく)</span>). The cock is a lot bigger than the turkey, so that’s why the turkey needs to stand on the stool in its attempt to seize those flowers.
* Imagine this scene again only with a big cock holding the flowers as the turkey attempts to seize them. Hear the cock shouting cock-a-doodle-doo as it defends its flowers.
