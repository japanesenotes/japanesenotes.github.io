## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> arrow</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> arrow</span> kanji are the same. Sort of a straight shot to memorizing this kanji, you know?
* Just know your radicals and you'll know this kanji!
* To remember the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [や](https://jisho.org/search/や)</span> we use the word “Yankees” (like the evil baseball team, go M’s!).<br />What is this arrow doing? It’s following around all the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ya</span>nkee (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [や](https://jisho.org/search/や)</span>) baseball players, stalking them, waiting to make its move (I’ll let you decide what its “move” is).
* Imagine the arrow as a human-sized living thing with legs, arms, and clothes, though. Strangely, it’s able to walk around even though it's an arrow. It has some kind of agenda. Make it a bit evil, if you can. What a strange thing…
