## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spoon</span> to measure a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> geoduck</span> is a very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> approximate</span> measurement. Geoducks are big, spoons are small. Still, we'll get the approximation going, right?
* Do the comparison. A spoonful of geoduck aka a whole geoduck on a spoon. This is a spoonful, right? This is what the recipe wanted, I think...
* Maybe this is too much geoduck, even if we're going for an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> approximate</span>. So, you take the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> core</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ころ](https://jisho.org/search/ころ)</span>) of the geoduck and measure that instead. 
* That's a little better. Not too much geoduck. Still a lot, but more like an approximate.
