## Mnemonics
 * You see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> coming out of the top of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> so you go into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shock</span>. Your brain just can't comprehend what's in front of you.
* A tree... with... a... mouth? No, it can't be... I... a-. Your face warps into a permanent state of shock.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shock</span> you've suffered results in you needing to stay <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ho</span>me (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほう](https://jisho.org/search/ほう)</span>) from now on. You don't get to travel, explore, or even get groceries. You're homebound from now on, buddy.
* I'd be shocked if you ever left your home again, honestly. But hey, there's always anime.
