## Mnemonics
 * You send your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> private</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sword</span> man out with your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> so he can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> trade</span> them. Shellfish were used as currency back in the olden days. And you aren't going to go out trading and dirty your own hands, no no. Trading your shellfish is the job for the private sword you hired!
* Imagine your private sword holding a big bag of shellfish and going off to market to trade them.
* While he's out making the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> trade</span> for you, you decide to relax and do some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bow</span>ling (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼう](https://jisho.org/search/ぼう)</span>). In fact, you can't wait for the trade to be done because you're hoping he's going to come back with a new bowling ball for you.
* Oh boy, I hope my private sword trades my shellfish for that new bowling ball I heard about!
