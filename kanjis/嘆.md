## Mnemonics
 * You use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> when you see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Chinese</span> person and you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sigh</span>. You sigh so loud that it’s practically a roar coming out of your mouth. Chinese people and Chinese things make you sigh because it reminds you of when you stayed in China and it brings up memories. The sigh is a sigh of nostalgia.
* Let out a long sigh as you recall memories from China and all the Chinese things you saw and did. Oh, sigh.
* Your favorite Chinese thing to do is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たん](https://jisho.org/search/たん)</span>). You can wander around without your shirt on and tan all day. No one will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sigh</span> or scoff at you, it’s perfectly acceptable. The Chinese just love to get their tan on.
* Sigh again as you remember how nice it was to tan everywhere. Picture yourself wandering around some Chinese streets with your shirt off as you soak in the rays and get a tan.
