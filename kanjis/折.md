## Mnemonics
 * If your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> are strong enough you can take an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> axe</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fold</span> it in half. Bad men were cutting down all the forests, so you're going around <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bend</span>ing their axes so they can't cut trees down anymore.
* Imagine holding an axe between your fingers and folding it like a pretzel. Or some silly putty. Or a really soft axe.
* Unfortunately, as you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fold</span> these axes in half you realize they come in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sets</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せつ](https://jisho.org/search/せつ)</span>), so there are twice the axes you thought there would be. To compensate, you start folding them in sets too.
* How many axes can you bend at once? A set of two? What about a set of four? Or a set of forty-two?
