## Mnemonics
 * You want to share <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> happiness</span> with people so you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stamp</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span>s with the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> news</span>. Now when people want a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> report</span> of all the happy things going on, they can just look down before they sit.
* Stand up and look at the happy news today! It definitely isn't sad or depressing.
* You research and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> report</span> the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> news</span> from <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ho</span>me (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほう](https://jisho.org/search/ほう)</span>). Only after, once all of the news is stamped onto the stools, do you leave your home.
* Because your reporting is done from home, most of the news is about how your plants are growing. What the cat did this morning. And it certainly isn't the news without the weather!
