## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horse</span> who can write a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> paragraph</span> gets to be a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chess piece</span>. Only the most erudite of horses gets selected to be a chess piece. The knight’s chess piece is represented by a horse, and for a horse to earn this honor, they must first write a paragraph explaining why they deserve the honor.
* Imagine a horse trying to write a paragraph about why it deserves to be a chess piece. See the horse struggle with his hooves to write out a paragraph as he neighs in nervous frustration.
* Upon being told that he will never be a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chess piece</span>, the horse slips into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coma</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こま](https://jisho.org/search/こま)</span>). The horse will never awaken from this coma as he knows he will never fulfill his dream of becoming a chess piece, so he has nothing to live for.
* See this horse in its coma. You feel bad that it will never be able to be a chess piece, but this is a bit dramatic.
