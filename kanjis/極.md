## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> eats a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> beggar</span> and his <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span>, which were on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> next to him, which seems to be a bit <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> extreme</span>, don't you think?
* The beggar was just sitting there on a stool! Why so extreme?
* Unfortunately we still haven’t come up with a good reading for <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょく](https://jisho.org/search/きょく)</span>, but just try and remember this reading as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Goku</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ごく](https://jisho.org/search/ごく)</span>) from Dragon Ball Z and his strange step brother <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kyoku</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょく](https://jisho.org/search/きょく)</span>). Goku and Kyoku are the beggars in this story, the ones performing all the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> extremes</span>. First Goku gets eaten by the tree with the mouth, and then Kyoku gets eaten as well.
* You know Goku from Dragon Ball, right? Imagine him doing all sorts of extreme things. Then imagine his less impressive brother, Kyoku, also doing extremes. And then they get eaten by the tree.
