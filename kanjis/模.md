## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> grows next to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> greenhouse</span> enclosing an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> imitation</span> of the tree. The imitation greenhouse tree wants to be big and impressive like the tree outside, so it does its very best imitation of a real tree.
* Look at this greenhouse tree struggle to grow big and strong like the wild tree outside. Hear its leaves shake and timber creak. How cute.
* The greenhouse tree realizes that its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> imitation</span> will never be as good as the real thing. When it realizes this, the tree <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mo</span>ans (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [も](https://jisho.org/search/も)</span>) aloud. The tree is still kinda tiny, so the moan isn’t very loud, but it is still pretty strange to witness. Speaking of witnesses, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Bo</span>bo (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼ](https://jisho.org/search/ぼ)</span>) the clown sees this greenhouse tree moaning and decides to take it for his next clown show. Surely this miniature moaning tree can be worked into Bobo's next clown act.
* Hear the little tree moaning at its pitiful imitation of a real tree. The greenhouse tree sounds very sad and you actually start to feel bad for it. Moan along with the tree in sympathy.
