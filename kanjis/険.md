## Mnemonics
 * SQUID games, which happen in secret BUILDINGS, are RISKY.<br><br>Going into a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span> made by a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> squid</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> risky</span>. First of all, squids only have tentacles, no bones, and they make all of their buildings out of risky materials like kelp and sharp coral.
* One squid got stuck in his own building, but no one could save him because going in would be too risky. Poor little squid.
* It's too <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> risky</span>, leave me! the squid cries. I'll save you, underwater citizen! Nothing is too risky for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ken</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けん](https://jisho.org/search/けん)</span>) the samurai! The building is collapsing on the squid, the risk is so great, but Ken the samurai dives in and saves him!
* The squid cries, I can build one that isn't so risky next time! Ken shakes his head, I'm not letting you do anymore risky things, you're coming with me from now on. Ken scoops up the squid into a bucket, hoists him over his shoulder, and walks off into the sunset.<br />Who knows what adventures await our new duo. All we know is that they'll definitely be getting into some risky business.
