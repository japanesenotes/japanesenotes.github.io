## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> swept away one of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cleat</span>s your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> husband</span> just bought and creates an entire <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> valley</span> with it.
* Watch as the tsunami rakes your husband's cleat across the mountain, carving a valley and an easier path for itself. Nature is brutal.
* When the water clears, you and your husband go to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> valley</span> to look for the cleat and instead you find a bunch of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>ke (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けい](https://jisho.org/search/けい)</span>)! Maybe this is the tsunami's way of saying, Thanks for letting me steal your cleat so I could make this valley shortcut. 
* Imagine yourself eating cake with your husband in this newly formed valley. You both agree that this should be called Cake Valley!
