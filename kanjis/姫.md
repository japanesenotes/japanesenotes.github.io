## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> woman</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> servant</span> is the lower ranking <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> princess</span>. The queen is no servant. Hecks no. Just the princess, because she's a servant to what her parents tell her to do.
* Just imagine a princess saying UGH, I'm just like a servant, I have to do all the crap you tell me. Then, all the servants roll their eyes, because, really, she's a princess, lucky duck.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> princess</span> goes on to do whatever she wants. She tells the real servants, Don't tell my daddy, the king, I did this. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> He may</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひめ](https://jisho.org/search/ひめ)</span>) not like it.
* The servants all know they should tell the king, because the princess is a servant to the king, just as they are, plus they don't want to lose their heads.
