## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rain</span> is being mixed up and slashed at by a sky <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> wolverine</span>. This is causing the rain to get very cold and turn into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> snow</span>.
* Imagine the wolverine running around the clouds frantically, trying to cool the air down with his claws to make this snow. For some reason, it's very important to him - perhaps you could help him out in that imagination of yours?
* You ask the wolverine, Why do you want this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> snow</span> so bad? He replies quickly: Because the rain is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yucky</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆき](https://jisho.org/search/ゆき)</span>).
* He keeps saying Yucky yucky yucky over and over again. Imagine him doing this with an accent that would bring the word closer to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆき](https://jisho.org/search/ゆき)</span>.
