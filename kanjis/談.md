## Mnemonics
 * You <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fire</span>! And more <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fire</span> appears too. You're trying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> discuss</span> something that's really important to you and literal fire is coming out of your mouth and mixing with the fire coming out of other peoples' mouths.
* Think back to the last time you had to discuss something and it got really heated. Imagine actual fire coming out of your mouth as you say what you believe and watch as it blasts into the fire coming out of the other person's mouth.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> discuss</span> in this intense, fiery way all the way until <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dawn</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だん](https://jisho.org/search/だん)</span>), but no longer! Once dawn comes the discussion needs to be concluded.
* If you try to discuss something all night and past dawn, you'll burn out. Take the day, think, then tonight you can try to discuss it again.
