## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> needs <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> measurement</span>s done every year to make sure it will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> protect</span> you properly.
* If you think about it, your roof protects you from a lot of things! Rain, snow, bird poop. But if your roof's measurements are off it won't be able to protect you properly.
* If the measurements are off, and your roof doesn't <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> protect</span> you, then you get to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [す](https://jisho.org/search/す)</span>)! If you're still alive, that is.
* Odds are, the roof collapsed or a tree fell on you and you died from lack of protection. So now your family and friends are going to sue on your behalf.
