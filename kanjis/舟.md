## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> boat</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boat</span> kanji are the same!
* Boats are boats, you know?
* The reading is the same as the kanji <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [船](https://jisho.org/search/船)</span>, though there's an extra reading there as well, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふな](https://jisho.org/search/ふな)</span>. They're close, so you should be able to remember it based off of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふね](https://jisho.org/search/ふね)</span>.
* Try to answer <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふな](https://jisho.org/search/ふな)</span> a couple times when doing your reviews. It'll help when we get to the vocab part.
