 * If you can find the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> door</span> in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> shaped like a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> it will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> enlighten</span> you.
* Imagine searching for this special door in the cold wind and snow of winter. The search for enlightenment always has something to do with suffering and searching on your own like this.
* The door <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> enlight</span>ened you by opening up and revealing the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>ke (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けい](https://jisho.org/search/けい)</span>) in its door-mouth. Cake is the key to enlightenment, my child. Now eat it from my mouth.
* All you need to do to attain enlightenment is to eat this cake... out of this mouth. Eh. Maybe enlightenment isn't worth it.
