## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stick</span>, a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hook</span>, and an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> arrow</span> is able to change the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> climate</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> weather</span>. Not just the type of climate that causes sunny and rainy days though, the political climate too, because they're a political <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> candidate</span> too.
* Imagine this leader twirling his stick around with his hook so quickly it changes the actual weather. Then he shoots it into the sky with an arrow, changing the actual climate itself.
* Who is this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> climate</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> weather</span>-changing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> candidate</span> leader with the hook, stick, and arrow? It's none other than <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>.
* Ask <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> why he's changing the climate. He says more people do their WaniKani reviews when it's raining, so he decided to create climate change to make it more dangerous to go outside. This way, people will stay indoors and do their WaniKani reviews, he tells you.
