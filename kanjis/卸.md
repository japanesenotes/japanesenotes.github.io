## Mnemonics
 * You should <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stop</span> to buy <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stamp</span>s at <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> noon</span> because that's the only time they're being sold at <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wholesale</span> price. Everyone's so busy eating and working and being at school, that they miss this awesome deal, but not you. Everyday at noon you stock up on wholesale stamps. Do you send a lot of mail? No, you probably just collect them. But they were cheap, so who cares!
* Imagine yourself stopping at the empty bank at noon, grabbing a handful of wholesale stamps. So many stamps. So few extra charges.
* Oh, one more thing. Going at noon isn't enough, you have to say the password to get them at <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wholesale</span> price too. The password is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Oh Roshi</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おろし](https://jisho.org/search/おろし)</span>). Okay, so maybe that's just the name of the guy there, but it always works when I want to get stamps wholesale so you should do it too!
* Oh Roshi you say carefully as you hand your stamps over at noon. The guy raises an eyebrow at you, but gives you them wholesale! It worked!
