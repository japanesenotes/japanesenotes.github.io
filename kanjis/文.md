## Mnemonics
 * The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> writing</span> first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> writing</span> as well.
* Make sure you know those radicals, yo!
* This kanji has more than one important reading you need to learn, sorry! But don't worry, here's a mnemonic to help you:<br />When you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> writing</span> you need things to fuel you. That's why you always eat <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bun</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶん](https://jisho.org/search/ぶん)</span>) while you write. Bread bun, hot crossed buns, whatever as long as they're buns, they're great writing fuel.<br />When buns aren't enough, you call in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mon</span>ster (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [もん](https://jisho.org/search/もん)</span>) that lives under your bed. It pretends to chase you, motivating your writing even further, because if you don't write fast, you'll die by monster bites.
* Imagine shoveling buns into your mouth and running from a monster as you're writing. You're so determined! This is going to be the best thing you've ever written!
