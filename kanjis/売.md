## Mnemonics
 * There’s a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> samurai</span> with (just) his <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> forehead</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> legs</span>. Everything in between is missing. What happened to everything in between? He was low on money, so he had to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sell</span> it all, leaving him with only the top and the bottom.
* Imagine this terrifying samurai. You have legs… okay, that’s normal. But, then you have just a giant forehead on the top of everything else, walking around. It's pretty scary that someone would sell such important parts of their body.
* If you see a samurai trying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sell</span> all their body parts here's what you should say, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Bye</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばい](https://jisho.org/search/ばい)</span>)! and just get the heck out of there. Actually, if anyone tries to sell you a body part you should probably say bye over and over until you can get away from them.
* Imagine saying, Bye, loudly into the forehead of a samurai trying to sell you the rest of their face. If you say it loud enough it will distract them while you run away.
