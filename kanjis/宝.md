## Mnemonics
 * Under his <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span>, the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span> stares into a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> of water containing his greatest <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> treasure</span>. Just kidding, the king has way more treasure than that. The drop of water is just reflecting what's around him: mounds and mounds of treasure, stacked all the way up to the roof.
* Picture the treasure reflected in the drop of water. It's marvelous!
* All of this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> treasure</span> is kept in the king's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ho</span>me (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほう](https://jisho.org/search/ほう)</span>). He can't let other people see how much treasure he has, or they'll get mad, or worse(!) ask him to share some with his people. Yuck. The treasure stays at home.
* Picture his home from the outside. It looks like a normal, small castle. But then you walk in and it's a treasure trove of... well, treasure!
