## Mnemonics
 * Under a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span> sits with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> twenty</span> little <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> contraptions</span>. There's little electronic ones, little bopping ones, little walking ones... twenty of them.
* Can you even imagine twenty completely unique contraptions? Why don't you try, just for fun.
* You want to know what these <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> contraptions</span> are for, so you ask. The drunkard says, These are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ka</span>yak (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かい](https://jisho.org/search/かい)</span>) contraptions *urp* they're for your uh *blarp* kayak... things.
* Kayak contraptions is pretty vague, but you do have a kayak, so you're tempted anyway. If only you could figure out what each contraption did so you could justify buying some.
