## Mnemonics
 * If you're <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> anti</span>-<span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span>, you're probably afraid of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> heights</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> slopes</span>. The only downside to a building is that they're high and if you fall off of them you could die. So if someone says they're anti-building, they're really just anti-heights.
* Imagine standing on the edge of a very high building. If you feel sick or upset, you may be one of these anti-height people!
* Another person you know who's afraid of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> heights</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Han</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はん](https://jisho.org/search/はん)</span>) Solo. Now wait, you may be thinking, he flies a space ship! You're right, because he doesn't like to walk all the way up high buildings, it freaks him out. He flies up instead so he doesn't have to think about falling.
* Imagine standing at the top of a tall building with Han Solo. He's very afraid of heights. They make him nervous. Like something bad will happen if he were to ever stand above a big pit, high up.
