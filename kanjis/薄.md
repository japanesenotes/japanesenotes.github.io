## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> are being worked upon by a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> specialty</span> for knowing how to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dilute</span> things. The tsunami can dilute the flowers by pouring itself onto it. A tsunami can dilute things because it is made of water. You could say that it’s its specialty.
* Look at the flowers as they begin to dilute. Their color and fragrance and dimensions become weaker and more spread out. It’s really trippy to witness.
* As you watch the flower <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dilute</span>, you determine that this is obviously a nature <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hack</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はく](https://jisho.org/search/はく)</span>). You’ve never seen anything like this before, so you think the tsunami found out how to hack nature and that’s how it got so good at diluting things. By hacking nature.
* As you continue to watch the flower dilute due to the water being poured onto it by the tsunami, imagine what techniques this tsunami is using to hack nature. Is the tsunami a super cyborg from the future? Maybe.
