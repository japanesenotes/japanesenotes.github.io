## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> beggar</span> lies sprawled on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> so you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> give</span> him some money. You feel bad for the beggar on the ground, so that’s why you decided to give him something.
* See the beggar on the ground. He’s writhing in agony and moaning for help. Imagine how sad and pitiful he looks.
* When you set the money down next to the beggar he shouts, “No! I want a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>-yo (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よ](https://jisho.org/search/よ)</span>)!” so you go to the corner store and buy him a yo-yo with the money instead. You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> give</span> the yo-yo to the beggar and he looks very happy.
* Now watch as the beggar plays with the yo-yo you just gave him. He’s actually pretty good with it. See the beggar doing insane tricks with his new yo-yo as passersby give him change for his impressive yo-yo performance.
