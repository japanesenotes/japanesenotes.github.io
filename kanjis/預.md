## Mnemonics
 * If you want to buy a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> geoduck</span> you have to go to the bank <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> beforehand</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deposit</span> enough money. If you don't deposit your money you won't have enough in your account to buy even one! They're expensive, after all.
* Imagine yourself depositing your money beforehand. Imagine the delicious geoduck you'll be able to buy now that the money has been deposited into your account!
* You go to the bank to make the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deposit</span> and there is a kid standing in your way playing with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>-yo (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よ](https://jisho.org/search/よ)</span>). You try to squeeze past and he hits you in the face with the yo-yo! Now you can't see! Now you can't make the deposit!
* Imagine trying to make a deposit to your bank after getting hit in the face with a yo-yo. You can hardly see what you're shoving your money into. You hope it isn't the hands of the kid that hit you!
