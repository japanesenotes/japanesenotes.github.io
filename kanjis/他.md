## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> alligators</span>... he's no ordinary leader, that's for sure. He's not a politician.. he's not a king... He's one of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Other</span> Ones, a group of strange, eccentric people who become leaders of animals.
* Imagine different groups of leaders - they're all dressed nice and normal. Then, off to the side are the leaders who are leaders of bears, cats, alligators, and narwhals... they're the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> other</span> ones, no matter how you look at it. They are in their own group, and they are considered others because society won't accept them :(
* To remember the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [た](https://jisho.org/search/た)</span>, we use the word Taco<br />Then there's the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> other</span>s of the others. These are the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ta</span>co (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [た](https://jisho.org/search/た)</span>) worshipers. They're really strange.
* Just imagine the others shaking their heads at these taco worshipers. Seriously, what the heck?
