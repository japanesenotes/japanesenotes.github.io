## Mnemonics
 * If you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> announce</span> that <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> alcohol</span> is illegal you're just being <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cruel</span>. Honestly, saying no one can have any alcohol at all is totally <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> unjust</span>. They tried that in the 1920s and it didn't work then either, so cut it out! Let people drink what they want to drink!
* Imagine if your country's leader announced that there would be no more alcohol. People would be in the streets in seconds calling them cruel and unjust!
* After this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cruel</span> announcement is made everyone will turn to the next best thing after alcohol. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Coke</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こく](https://jisho.org/search/こく)</span>)! It's not a replacement, but if this unjust law won't change, then coke sales are going to go through the roof.
* Imagine drinking coke while complaining how unjust it is that you can't add rum to it.
