## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Gambler</span>s usually only see the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> at <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dawn</span>. They gamble all day and through the night, and if they leave it's at the crack of dawn to get home, clean up, and then go back. I haven't known a gambler who's seen the sun ... well ever!
* Imagine being a gambler and seeing the bright dawn sun when you come out of the casino or pachinko parlor. It burns your eyes! Evil dawn, get back inside quick!
* If you're up at <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dawn</span> you'll also see the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> あか</span> (red) <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> つき</span> (moon). The <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あかつき](https://jisho.org/search/あかつき)</span> only happens as the sun comes up at dawn so usually only gamblers see it. But if you get up early, you can see it too!
* Imagine getting up at dawn and seeing the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あかつき](https://jisho.org/search/あかつき)</span> in the sky near the sun. It's so beautiful!
