Nostalgia for all the things that happened every single time you wore those clothes.
* When you put on an old piece of clothing, a shirt maybe, or some pants, feel the nostalgia that was embedded in it and left there by your soul.

Even if the memories and feelings weren't particularly bad, there's something about the wistful feeling of nostalgia that knots up your insides.
* Feel these nostalgic knots inside you. Now tie knots in the clothes that make you feel nostalgic so you don't wear them again.
