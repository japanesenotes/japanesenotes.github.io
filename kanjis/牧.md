## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cow</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> doesn't like to leave the barn to go to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pasture</span>. It has to, though, because a cow's gotta eat.
* It's cold outside (it's winter after all). Imagine you having to herd all the cows out to pasture even though they don't want to leave the warm barn.
* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼく](https://jisho.org/search/ぼく)</span> is one of the common ways to say I in Japanese (which you should remember!). In this case, you're a boy... a cowboy, and you say, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ぼく</span> will take these cows out to pasture!
* Actually say that phrase out loud while thinking about bringing your cows to pasture.
