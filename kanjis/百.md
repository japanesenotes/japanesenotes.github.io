## Mnemonics
 * There is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leaf</span> growing out of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span>! You fly out into space to check it out and when you get closer you see that it isn't just one leaf, it's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hundred</span>! That makes sense, you wouldn't be able to see just one leaf on the sun from where you were on earth.
* Imagine flying toward the sun to see a hundred leaves growing together in the shape of one big leaf. You want to go closer!
* You fly closer, counting all one <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hundred</span> leaves when you hear a strange sound. You take off your space helmet and hear, GUH <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> HYUCK</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひゃく](https://jisho.org/search/ひゃく)</span>)! You know that laugh... it's Goofy! On top of the hundredth leaf is Goofy laughing and waving around. He must have built this leaf tower to get your attention.
* Imaging hearing Goofy guh-hyuck over and over after you save him from being stranded on the sun. How would you feel being stuck in a cramped ship with laughing Goofy and his hundred leaves? Oh, you thought he would leave those behind? Nope, they saved him so you have to take them back too. Happy travels!
