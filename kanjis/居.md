## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span> is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> old</span> but that doesn't mean it's not still <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alive</span>. This is a living flag, and it gets old just like other living things.
* Imagine the old flag with a face and mouth and eyes and nose... it talks and listens and everything else. It's a flag that's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alive</span> D:
* The flag that is old and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> alive</span> is actually a Buddhist relic (that's why it's alive, in fact ... and old!). But, it's a really dumb relic, so it's put in little <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kyo</span>to (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょ](https://jisho.org/search/きょ)</span>).
* Not as cool as a real relic, it's put in this dumb Little Kyoto shrine that's basically just a tourist attraction. Eh, whatever.
