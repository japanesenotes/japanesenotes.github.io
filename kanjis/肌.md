## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> table</span> is a table that's made entirely of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> skin</span>. You thought the table was made of moon, with all those pores and such, but when you look more closely, you realize it's skin. Disgusting, porey, skin.
* Touch it and feel the moon table. You know it's not made of moon. How ridiculous.
* But, when you go to touch this moon table made of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> skin</span>, you realize that it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> harder</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はだ](https://jisho.org/search/はだ)</span>) than you expected. 
* You'd think skin would be softer, but it's pretty hard. Much harder than you expected.
