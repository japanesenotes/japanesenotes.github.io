## Mnemonics
 * I'm putting all my <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> on <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> someone</span>, hoping they'll win the race! This is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gamble</span> and you're gambling.
* Remember, shellfish used to be used as money. So if you're betting shellfish on someone, you're just gambling. And you probably won't get any of those shellfish back.
* If you win this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gamble</span> you'll have enough shellfish to buy a brand new <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>)!
* If you go to any of those fancy (and not so fancy) gamble-places, they always have a car sitting in the middle of the room. Usually rotating, really slowly, to make you want it more, making you gamble more.
