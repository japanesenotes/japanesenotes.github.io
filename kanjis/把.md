## Mnemonics
 * Put your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bed</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grasp</span> the sheets and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bundle</span> them up. Now you can do the laundry!
* Imagine pressing your fingers into the bed, grasping tightly and ripping the sheets free. Then you bundle them up into your arms so you can stuff them into the washing machine.
* In between <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> grasp</span>ing and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bundle</span>-ing, you shout <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> HA</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span>)! That's when the sheets come off the bed.
* The next time you grasp your bedsheets yell Ha! as you yank them off. Now chuckle a bit, ha ha ha, as you bundle them up into a ball. You can't beat me, bedsheets.
