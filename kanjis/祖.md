## Mnemonics
 * You come across a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spirit</span> wearing a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> top hat</span> and it claims to be your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ancestor</span>. Well of course, if you remember correctly, all of your ancestors wore top hats when they were alive. This spirit must be your long lost, great great... uh... somebody.
* Imagine coming across your long dead top hatted ancestor in spirit form. What would you do? What would you say?
* You ask your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ancestor</span> what it wants and it points to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> so</span>ap (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そ](https://jisho.org/search/そ)</span>) by the sink. Soap? It nods at you. I guess your ancestor is here to see the wonders of soap.
* Your ancestor didn't come here to see you, it just wanted to learn about soap. Something that they didn't have back when it was alive. That's actually kinda sad... and stinky. Your ancestor needs to use this soap, if anything.
