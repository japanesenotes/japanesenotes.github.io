## Mnemonics
 * We put a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span> to remember where we tried to use a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> jackhammer</span> to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> measure</span> your friend's <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span>. Granted, it was a terrible idea, but hopefully that flag of remembrance is some kind of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> consolation</span>?
* Obviously it's not good enough consolation. Be furious about this.
* Even though you weren't happy with the flag, you were even more frustrated to watch an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gle swoop down and grab the flag and fly away with it.
* Now you have absolutely nothing. Not even a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> consolation</span> flag.
