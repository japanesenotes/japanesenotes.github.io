## Mnemonics
 * Use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> to grab this guy's <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> foot</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> catch</span> him! Not physically though, you do grab his foot, but you close your eyes, and catch the idea of him in your mind just by touching your fingers to his foot.
* You don't really like the idea of touching your fingers to someone's foot, so you do it ever so slightly, and only catch the gist of what it's like.
* As you touch his foot, you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> catch</span> a glimpse of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Torah</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とら](https://jisho.org/search/とら)</span>) in your mind. Suddenly, you are able to grasp and understand every single thing written in the Torah. You fall to the ground.
* You wipe your eyes and look up, seeing that the person running from you is wearing socks with little pictures of the Torah on them. You were able to catch that in your brain but not the person. You must have touched those Torah socks and not his foot. You've been tricked!
