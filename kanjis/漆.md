## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> hits a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> and your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hat</span> protects you from the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> water</span>, but the hat itself is now covered in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lacquer</span>. You take it off and see that it's shiny and hard and protected.
* Picture your hat and all of the other things the tsunami + tree water touched. It's all been hardened with a thick coating of the lacquer.
* You decide to scoop up the rest of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lacquer</span> water and use it on your furniture to protect it from your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shih tzu</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しつ](https://jisho.org/search/しつ)</span>). Now it can't bite or scratch or ruin any of your things anymore!
* Watch as your shih tzu tries to bite your now lacquered chair. It gets its teeth around the leg, but it's hard as a rock. The shih tzu starts sneezing and spitting, letting go. Looks like it tastes bad too. Perfect!
