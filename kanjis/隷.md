## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> samurai</span> has a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> jackhammer</span>, a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> brush</span>, and some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> water</span>. All these things tell you that this samurai is actually a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> slave</span>.
* Traditionally, samurai don't carry things like jackhammers, brushes, or water. The samurai is carrying these things for someone else, meaning this samurai is somebody's slave.
* You don't like seeing a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> slave</span>. As you walk by, you hand him a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ray</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [れい](https://jisho.org/search/れい)</span>) gun so he can free himself.
* The samurai slave can use the ray gun to shoot his keeper and get away. Imagine watching him holding up his master and getting away. A ray gun is a truly powerful weapon in the hands of a slave.
