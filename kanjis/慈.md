 * A person with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span> has you on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> and lets loose two <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> poops</span> over your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Mercy</span>! Mercy! You cry, but the horned dude doesn't stop until there are two gross poops sitting on your heart. M-mercy... is the only thing you can think to say.
* Imagine yourself saying mercy over an over as this horned guy has you on the ground and keeps pooping over your heart. 
* As you shout <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Mercy</span>! one more time, suddenly <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Je</span>sus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span>) appears out of no where and punches the horned guy into the stratosphere. Jesus snaps his fingers and the poop is gone and you're off the ground. Your heart is safe.
* Imagine yourself saying mercy and seeing Jesus appearing just in time to save the day. The word mercy must be his bat signal. Jesus signal? Sure.
