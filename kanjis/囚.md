## Mnemonics
 * Inside this giant <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> person</span>, trapped, because they're a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> criminal</span>. They did something bad (they touched the mouth of another person without consent) and now they're in mouth jail for criminals.
* Picture the criminal, trapped inside the mouth. They don't even look sorry!
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> criminal</span> is only wearing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shoe</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅう](https://jisho.org/search/しゅう)</span>). They're completely naked otherwise. They have to wear shoes because the mouth jail would be too slippery for them to stand otherwise.
* Wearing nothing but shoes is also really uncomfortable too, so it's actually part of the criminal's punishment. They don't seem to know that though.
