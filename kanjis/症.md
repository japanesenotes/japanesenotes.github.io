## Mnemonics
 * When someone is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sick</span> in order to diagnose the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> correct</span> cause and treatment, you need to check their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> symptom</span>s. You have to be especially careful too, because if you get a symptom wrong, you could kill them!
* If you know all of the symptoms for each and every sickness you'd be able to cure them all!
* You need to figure out the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> symptom</span>s the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>) is having. This is really serious too, so you better be correct about which sickness he has. If something bad happens to the Shougun it will be off with your head.
* You get all up close and personal with the Shougun. Hmm, his symptoms are watery eyes, stuffy nose, angry shouting (wait no, that's not a symptom, is it?). Don't mess up!
