## Mnemonics
 * You wear a great big <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> on your chest and you attend a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> specialty</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exhibition</span> for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gambling</span>. The big cross on your chest is your badge for being admitted into the exhibition. Everyone at the specialty exhibition has a cross, and everyone is gambling.
* Picture yourself at this specialty exhibition. Feel the weight of the cross shaped badge on your chest as you continue gambling at the exhibition.
* You’re not very good at <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gambling</span>, but you are pretty good at cheating. You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hack</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はく](https://jisho.org/search/はく)</span>) the specialty <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exhibition</span> gambling machines to pay out lots of cash just for you. You hack quickly and quietly, so luckily no one notices that you’ve hacked the system.
* Hack the gambling machines. Imagine the sounds of the exhibition around you as you work to hack the machines. Look at the computer parts and cables as you work.
