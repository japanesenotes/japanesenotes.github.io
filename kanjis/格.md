## Mnemonics
 * If you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> kiss</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span>, your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> status</span> will change to, “In a relationship with a tree.”
* You know Facebook relationship statuses. If you kiss a tree, your status will be that you’re in a relationship with said tree. Imagine how silly that would be.
* Regardless of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> status</span>, you need to let the tree know how you feel. Being a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かく](https://jisho.org/search/かく)</span>), y'know, a male chicken, you cock-a-doodle-do your true feelings to the tree. You actually just want to be friends.
* Picture yourself as a cock, cock-a-doodle-doing about how you really feel about the tree. What would you say to let the tree down easy?
