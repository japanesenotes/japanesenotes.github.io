## Mnemonics
 * There is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> forehead</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> attached to it, forcing you to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> search</span> where it leads. You’re not sure how the cross got stuck in your forehead, but you are interested in seeing where this piece of thread leads. The search is on.
* It hurts to have this cross stuck in your forehead, but try to ignore that as you search for where the thread leads. Imagine gathering the thread in your hands as you move along.
* Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> search</span> is over. You found the end of the thread. The thread leads you to a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sack</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さく](https://jisho.org/search/さく)</span>). A sack filled with more crosses with more threads attached to them. What does it all mean!?!
* Why are there more crosses and threads in the sack? Are you supposed to take them from the sack and throw them at other people’s foreheads? Maybe. Imagine yourself reaching into the sack and throwing the crosses at other people.
