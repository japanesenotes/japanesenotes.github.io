## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rake</span>d all the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mountain</span>s down into flat land so he could see everyone in the kingdom from his castle windows. You should share your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> congratulations</span> with him. Now, quick tell him this was a great idea.
* Imagine saying Congratulations! to a king who just ordered his servants to rake down all the pretty mountains in his kingdom.
* The moment you say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Congratulations</span>! you've already started to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> miss</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みず](https://jisho.org/search/みず)</span>) those beautiful mountains. But you can't let missing them ruin your congratulations! Don't let the king know!
* Imagine how hollow your congratulation sounds when you really miss those mountains. This king doesn't deserve your nice words.
