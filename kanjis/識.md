## Mnemonics
 * If you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sound</span> like a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span> when you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> things, people will not think of you as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> discerning</span> person. AWh yeah, that game is greatttt, you say in your drunken slurs. But, really, it sounds like you think all games are great, which isn't all that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> discriminating</span> of you at all.
* Picture yourself as a drunkard. What sort of discerning things are you saying? What are you trying to discern? Do you know?
* So, we've figured out that your drunken utterances are not very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> discerning</span>. But let's think about someone who is discerning. You're sitting next to a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Sheikh</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しき](https://jisho.org/search/しき)</span>) (an Arabic leader), and boy do they sound like they know what they are talking about. Maybe it's because he's not drunk like you. He has such discerning taste, that one!
* Imagine him saying some very (in your eyes) discerning things about everything around him. Color yourself impressed (and feel the impressed-ness)!
