## Mnemonics
 * You’re sitting on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span> and someone <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cleat</span>s you in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> forehead</span> as part of an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accept</span>ance ritual. It’s for the most prestigious Spanish soccer club in the world. You got knocked off the stool, and the cleats really hurt your forehead, but you’re just glad to have been accepted.<br />This kanji also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> receive</span>, which is quite similar to accept. It shouldn't be too hard to remember.
* You’re dealing with a lot of mixed emotions right now. You feel the pain from being cleated in the forehead and knocked clean off your stool, but you’re also glad to have finally been accepted into the soccer club. Suppress your pain. Accept this honor.
* <div>It's hard to be ACCEPTED into the religio of Judialism (JU)</div><div><br></div>After you've been <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accept</span>ed, they give you a small <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ju</span>ice (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゅ](https://jisho.org/search/じゅ)</span>) box to help you recover from the trauma of getting kicked. And you receive it with grace.
