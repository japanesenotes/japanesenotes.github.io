## Mnemonics
 * The water from a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> can create a lot of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> energy</span> when made into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> steam</span>. Steam power used to be all the rage back in the day. Steam comes from water, water comes from tsunamis, so logically, tsunamis are a great source of energy.
* Imagine how much steam a tsunami could create. Hear the steam hissing off of the water and feel the moisture from the steam washing over your body.
* In order to contain this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> steam</span> energy and store it for later, you lock it up in a box with a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>). That way the energy can be used at a later time. Provided you don’t lose the key, that is.
* Steam is very light, so carrying this box of steam energy will be no problem. Picture yourself wandering about with a box of steam in one hand and a key in the other.
