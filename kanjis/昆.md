## Mnemonics
 * If you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> compare</span> the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> to its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> descendants</span>, you’ll notice that the descendants don’t quite shine as brightly as the sun does. You don’t like to compare them, because each sun is special in its own way, but the descendants just aren’t quite as shiny as the original.
* Look at the sun and its many descendant stars. Their light burns your eyes, making them water. Picture yourself squinting while you look at these many suns.
* While you’re looking up at the sun and its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> descendants</span>, trying to compare them to one another, a flock of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> con</span>dors (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こん](https://jisho.org/search/こん)</span>) flies by, blocking out the sun. There’s a great many condors, and they manage to totally block out the light from the suns.
* While you’re looking up at the condors, one of them poops in your eye. Imagine the shame and frustration you feel with condor poo in your eye as you hear the condors screech and flap their wings as they pass by.
