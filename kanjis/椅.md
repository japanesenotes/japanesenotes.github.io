## Mnemonics
 * This <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> is very <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> odd</span>, to say the least. The shape is all crazy, like a lightning bolt stuck into the ground, or something. Oh wait, look at this. I can sit on it really nicely. It's just like a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chair</span>!
* Imagine this odd tree <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chair</span> being the most comfortable chair you've ever sat on. It's shaped perfectly for you, and the moss makes it soft. Wow, what a chair.
* But, this odd tree <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chair</span> is also home to an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>). It swoops down upon you as you sit down, gouging your eyes out.
* Feel the fear and regret. You should have known not to sit in this chair. Mother nature never forgives, and now you don't have eyeballs.
