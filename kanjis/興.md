## Mnemonics
 * There’s a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> comb</span> and what looks like the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> same</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> comb</span>, and you found them on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> next to some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fins</span> you showed <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> interest</span> in. At first, the shiny fins on the ground caught your interest, but once you got closer to the fins you also noticed a pair of combs that are interesting too.
* Pick up these fins and the two combs. Feel their weight in each hand as you examine them with interest. Smell the fish smell and feel the teeth on the combs.
* Since the combs <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> interest</span> you more than the fins, you examine the combs more closely. Taking interest in where they were made, you discover they were made in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> きょうと</span>. Dang, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょうと](https://jisho.org/search/きょうと)</span> sure does make some nice combs.
* You've always had an interest in <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょうと](https://jisho.org/search/きょうと)</span>, so it makes sense that you'd be interested in things from <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょうと](https://jisho.org/search/きょうと)</span> too.
