## Mnemonics
 * You use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> foot</span> to kick <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Wolverine</span> in the face so a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> leap</span> to freedom. This turkey is trying to escape from Wolverine by leaping over a fence. Wolverine doesn’t want the turkey to escape, but you kick him with your foot and the turkey is then free to leap to safety.
* Imagine kicking Wolverine in the head with your foot as the turkey makes turkey sounds in the background. He’s taller than you so you must leap as you kick.
* After you kick Wolverine and the turkey is safe, you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> leap</span> onto a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yak</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [やく](https://jisho.org/search/やく)</span>) to make your getaway. This yak is really fast so you’ll have no problem outrunning Wolverine while riding it.
* Leap! Leap onto the yak. Feel the yak fur beneath you as you ride away to safety, wind in your hair.
