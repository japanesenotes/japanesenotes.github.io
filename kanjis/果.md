## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fruit</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fruit</span> kanji are exactly the same! Bodacious!
* 
* They sell <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fruit</span> at the store, and you need to drive your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>) to get there. A car is the fastest way to fruit.
* Imagine you have a hankering for your favorite fruit. You gotta get in your car and put the pedal to the metal! Feel the wind in your hair as your car speeds down the road and listen to that engine purr.
