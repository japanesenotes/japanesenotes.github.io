## Mnemonics
 * Someone on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> has an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> axe</span>, and they're getting <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> near</span> to you really fast! Oh no, they're so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> close</span> now, you need to get out of here!
* Picture a scooter coming toward you in the dark. You see the gleam of the axe as it looms nearer and nearer.
* As they draw <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> near</span>, you recognize who is riding the scooter: the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kin</span>g (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きん](https://jisho.org/search/きん)</span>) of England! Behind him, a bunch of his guards also on scooters and wielding axes appear and move <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> close</span> to you. 
* The King is now so near to you his nose and mustache are tickling your face. He's holding the axe high above his head and saying, I can get as close to you as I want and you can't stop me because I'm the King. I can get sooooo close. Look, I'm not touching you though!
