## Mnemonics
 * People had to ride their <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bamboo</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> plow</span>s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> long ago</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> enroll</span> in things. There were no cars yet, so they would hitch a cow to their bamboo plow, and dig their way to the government office or school to enroll.
* Picture the little hut that passed for school long ago. All of the bamboo plows are parked around it, as the people enroll themselves and their kids up for classes.
* If you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> enroll</span> in something new people will find you very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sexy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せき](https://jisho.org/search/せき)</span>). This was true long ago too. There's nothing sexier than trying to improve yourself.
* Picture a line of people enrolling for new classes, sports, citizenship, etc. The moment they've enrolled they poof into the perfect, sexy person (in your eyes).
