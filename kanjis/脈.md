## Mnemonics
 * Under the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> while you sit on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cliff</span>, you inject a syringe of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tofu</span> right into your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> vein</span>. Ahh, tofu. You’re addicted to it. You sneak out to the cliff at night to get your tofu fix, injecting it straight into your vein.
* Feel the tofu running through your veins. Feel the tofu goodness spreading all over your body. It’s so intense you can even taste a little tofu in your mouth.
* Eventually, your friends and family find you at the cliff, tripping on tofu. Each and every <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> vein</span> on your body is engorged, pulsating with the effects of tofu. Your friends try and take you home. “You cyan’t <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> myake</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みゃく](https://jisho.org/search/みゃく)</span>) me!” You slur, suffering from the effects of the tofu. “None of you cyan myake me go home! You cyan’t myake me! Nyah!”
* Say this out loud, it’ll help you remember. Really focus on the “myake” be sure to say it like you’re all bugged out from tofu overdose.
