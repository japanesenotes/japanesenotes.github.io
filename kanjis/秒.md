## Mnemonics
 * You only got a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> few</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grain</span>s on your plate. It only takes you a  <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> second</span> to eat them. It can't take any longer because there were so few.
* Count how many seconds it takes for you to eat the few grains you have. One... oh, they're gone.
* And also, a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> second</span> is how long it takes for your awful <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> B.O.</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [びょう](https://jisho.org/search/びょう)</span>) to appear. 
* Whenever you eat a few grains, even if only for a second, you get a terrible reaction seconds later that causes some pretty terrible B.O.
