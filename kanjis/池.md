## Mnemonics
 * The poor <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> alligator</span> was taken far inland by a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span>. Now his only source of water is a tiny <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pond</span> that barely fits his body, and doesn't even provide much food.
* Imagine the alligator riding the tsunami in. When he hits the ground, and the water recedes, he's all alone in a pond, but it doesn't provide much for him. Imagine him looking for food in the little, shallow pond. Imagine him trying to stay wet... it's just not a great situation to be in, unfortunately.
* The worst part about this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pond</span> is that the only thing for the alligator to eat is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chee</span>se (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ち](https://jisho.org/search/ち)</span>). Cheese may be yummy for humans, but alligators hate it. They'd rather eat the cow the cheese came from. Sadly, this pond is full of cheese.
* Picture an alligator crying in a pond full of cheese. It's eating a piece really slowly and weeping.
