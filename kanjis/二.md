## Mnemonics
 * The kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two</span> and the radical <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> two</span> are the exact same things. Therefore, you know the kanji for two already!
* More simply put, you can just know that this kanji is the double of One. It's two lines, that's not all that hard to remember!
* Think of all the things you have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Two</span> of. What is the most important? Some would say eyes, some would say ears. I would say the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> knee</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [に](https://jisho.org/search/に)</span>) because if you didn't have them, it'd be really hard to go up stairs.
* Imagine yourself without two knees, and see what it would be like. What would give you trouble? What couldn't you do? Just imagining this for a minute or two will help you to remember the reading of this kanji more effectively.
