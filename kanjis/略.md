## Mnemonics
 * You see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span> and you give it a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> kiss</span> before granting it the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> abbreviation</span>, RP. The rice paddy isn’t too fond of this abbreviation, so you kiss it again to soothe it.
* As you imagine yourself giving a kiss to a rice paddy, think about whether or not the abbreviation RP would ever catch on. Do you think it would?
* The rice paddy still refuses to accept this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> abbreviation</span> despite your kisses. Therefore, you are forced to take the rice paddy and hang it from a torture <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rack</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りゃく](https://jisho.org/search/りゃく)</span>) until it agrees to accept the abbreviation.
* Imagine the rice paddy on the rack, squealing for mercy. Turn the handle to turn the rack, causing the rice paddy even more discomfort.
