## Mnemonics
 * You took someone's <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> alcohol</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span>'d it all into the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> river</span>. Now you have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> repay</span> them. Alcohol costs a lot of money, you know.
* Picture yourself dropping the alcohol, drop by drop, into the river. Uh oh, the person just caught up to you, so you better repay them.
* In order to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> repay</span> them for the alcohol you wasted, you offer to give them your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shoe</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅう](https://jisho.org/search/しゅう)</span>). They don't want your shoes though, so you have to bring them to a store and watch them try on a bunch of different pairs so you can repay them that way.
* Imagine waiting as this person tries on like twenty different pairs of shoes. They're getting them for free! Why do they have to be picky?! Just let me repay you already!
