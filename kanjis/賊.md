## Mnemonics
 * When a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> becomes a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span> and sees a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span>, they'll become a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> robber</span>. Because they'll steal the cross!
* Some people make really bad choices when they're drunk, and in this case, when a shellfish gets drunk and sees something it wants it'll just rob people for it.
* Once the shellfish has a taste for being a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> robber</span>, he'll join a Boso<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> zoku</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぞく](https://jisho.org/search/ぞく)</span>) bike gang so he can keep stealing more and more crosses. He'll drink more, steal more, and get to ride cool motorcycles.
* Picture a robber shellfish in a Bosozoku bike gang. Look at him the wrong way and he and his gang will steal all your stuff next time!
