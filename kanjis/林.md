## Mnemonics
 * You have a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> and another <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span>. You basically have yourself a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> forest</span>!
* Follow the logic of this one and you should be okay.
* So, now you have this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> forest</span> and you want to cut it down (so much money!). But, you don't have any tools, only your hands. You think... I've done karate for a while, so I can probably chop it down that way. You get in a chopping stance, then do your battle cry and hit: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> HAYA ... .SHI******</span>!
* Obviously that didn't work well - you'll want to focus on your battle cry plus indecent swearing right afterwards to remember this reading.
