## Mnemonics
 * Shoot a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> melon</span> out of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bow</span> and it will fly in a steep <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> arc</span>. Melons are too heavy to fly straight, after all.
* Imagine shooting a really heavy melon out of a bow. Watch it make an arc through the air. Trace the arc with your finger.
* Shooting melons in an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> arc</span> is something little <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 子</span>'s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span>) love to do. It also helps that when they come down from the arc they smash all over the place.
* Imagine being a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span> and watching melons fly in arcs all over. Imagine a little <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span> version of yourself giggling and clapping your hands with absolute glee.
