## Mnemonics
 * You need to go up on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span> down <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> seven</span> times to make this your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> house</span>. A house isn't a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> home</span> until you've slid down it exactly seven times, you know.
* Imagine sliding down your house from the roof all the way down to the ground. I hope you aren't afraid of heights, because you have to do this six more times.
* If you try to slide down your new <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> house</span> and you land on a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tack</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たく](https://jisho.org/search/たく)</span>), that means the house has rejected you. It isn't your home now. You need to leave and find a new home.
* As you slide, you close your eyes and really hope you don't end up with a tack in your butt and no home to sleep in tonight.
