## Mnemonics
 * When a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> man</span> meets a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tiger</span> he makes the tiger his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> captive</span>. Men are pretty crappy like that. They see tigers and they want to put them in cages, so the poor tiger becomes a captive of the man.
* Picture the sad tiger captive and the man laughing as he pokes at it. Tigers shouldn't be captives but when men find them they always seem to do this anyway.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> captive</span> tiger is even sadder because the man put him in a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ro</span>be (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りょ](https://jisho.org/search/りょ)</span>) and is making him act like a human. Tigers look good in robes, but they don't really enjoy being forced into people clothing.
* Picture the poor captive tiger being stuffed into a bathrobe and paraded around a cage for the man.
