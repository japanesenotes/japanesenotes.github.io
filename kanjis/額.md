## Mnemonics
 * This word has three really important meanings. It's probably best if you remember them all. Let's do this!<br />When you're a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> guest</span> somewhere it's important to bring <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> geoduck</span>s. But more than that, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> amount</span> of geoducks you bring is really what matters. If you don't have any live geoducks go ahead and bring any amount of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> framed picture</span>s of geoducks instead. If you can't even do that, well, then you're going to have to tattoo geoducks on your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> forehead</span>.
* If you're a guest you either have to have the right amount of geoducks, geoducks in framed pictures, or geoducks on your forehead. Otherwise you're a jerk.
* Unfortunately, if you mess up any of these things, (the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> amount</span>, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> framed picture</span>s, or the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> forehead</span> tattoo) every other guest will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gawk</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がく](https://jisho.org/search/がく)</span>) at you.
* Feel the feel of hundreds of gawks. Feel ashamed as they gawk at you. How could you!?
