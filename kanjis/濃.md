## Mnemonics
 * If a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> hits while you're <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> farming</span>, you'll have to wear really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thick</span> clothes to deal with it. The water is thick with fish and cars and other ripped-up debris too, which makes it even harder.
* Imagine putting on your thick farming suit as the tsunami comes at you. You hold onto your hoe and brace yourself for the wall of water.
* You knew to put on your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> thick</span> tsunami-proof farming gear because <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> No</span>stradamus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [のう](https://jisho.org/search/のう)</span>) warned you it was coming. He sent a message to your brain yesterday so you'd know what to wear today.
* Thanks Nostradamus, now I'm in my nice, thick gear, struggling to hoe my fields through this wall of tsunami water. But I'm not dead and I'm not wet.
