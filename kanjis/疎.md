## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> coat rack</span> will turn into a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bundle</span> of sticks if you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neglect</span> it. When you neglect a coat rack, the weight from the coats will pull all of the arms off, leaving it as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sparse</span> stick.
* Picture this sparse, neglected coat rack. All of its arms and the coats that were on it have fallen off and are in a big pile on the ground.
* You go up to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neglect</span>ed coat rack and try to make things right by cleaning it with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> so</span>ap (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そ](https://jisho.org/search/そ)</span>). But no matter how much you scrub, it won't get clean, the arms won't go back on.
* If you neglect something for too long, not even a good soap scrub will bring it back. That goes for humans too. Take care of yourselves. Use soap.
