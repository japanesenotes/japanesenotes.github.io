## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> can <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fix</span> the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> value</span> of certain goods and services. Leaders basically get to decide how much everything is worth in value, like rice or lamps or how much you get paid for the work you do.
* Imagine having a wonderful leader who values your work and time and so the value you get from working is high. Now imagine a terrible leader, who thinks you should be working at all times and doesn't find any value in what you do. Life will be a lot harder...
* This leader has fixed the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> value</span> of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chee</span>se (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ち](https://jisho.org/search/ち)</span>), making it ￥1 permanently. One yen! That's, like, less than a penny! Unfortunately, the leader won't fix any of the other really expensive things... so now everyone only eats cheese.
* Imagine if you could fix the value of cheese to something. How much would you make it cost? If you were a dairy farmer you'd probably be pretty pissed about the leader making it this low.
