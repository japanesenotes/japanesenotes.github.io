## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> of (odd looking) <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lion</span>s puts a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> of magic liquid on his face to look like a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> person</span> who might <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> resemble</span> someone else. The leader of lions is going incognito, so he needs to resemble a person who is not himself. He takes this drop of powerful face paint and transforms.
* Watch this leader as the transformation takes place. Now he doesn’t resemble anything like the leader he used to be. He doesn’t look like the same person. Watch him morph in your head.
* The reason he doesn’t <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> resemble</span> the same person anymore is because he actually resembles a horse now. The leader is now a horse! Listen to him <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neigh</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ね](https://jisho.org/search/ね)</span>) and stamp his feet. Woah, easy there boy!
* Listen to this horse who used to be a leader neigh and stomp around. Hear the neigh in your ears as you try and calm the horse down.
