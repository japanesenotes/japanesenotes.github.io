## Mnemonics
 * A religious <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> wearing a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mask</span> could be either a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> monk</span> or a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> priest</span>. You don’t know, their face is covered by a mask!
* Picture this leader in their mask. Listen to them chant prayers that reverberate throughout the building.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> monk</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> priest</span> is wearing a mask to protect their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>). You aren't a monk or a priest, so they don't want your not-religious-enough eyes to dirty their soul.
* Imagine the monk/priest's bright, pure soul shining behind the mask. You'll never actually see it, unless you're becoming a monk/priest yourself, and then your soul will need protecting too.
