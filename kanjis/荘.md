## Mnemonics
 * Clearing his <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> icicle</span>s, the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> samurai</span> returns home to his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> villa</span>.
* Picture the samurai's villa. It's in the countryside and covered in flowers and icicles. Even though it's spring, it's still cold, so all the new flowers are very cold.
* Once the samurai enters the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> villa</span>, he lets his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soul</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>) go. He's been fighting for long enough and this villa was always where he wanted to go.
* Picture the samurai sitting in a chair in his beautiful villa and breathing his last breath. His soul slowly floats up and out of his still body and dances around the villa, free.
