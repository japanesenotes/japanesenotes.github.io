## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> has an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> umbrella</span>, and it's holding it over his head, which is strange, because trees normally like water... turns out, it's not water falling on him, but dollar <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bills</span> floating down.
* The sick part of this is that those dollar <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bills</span> were once this tree's friends. The tree is sobbing uncontrollably as pieces of his friends fall on him and all around him - which is why he's using the umbrella to protect himself.
* The tree couldn’t take the body parts of his friends falling down on him, so he <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sat</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さつ](https://jisho.org/search/さつ)</span>) down, and began crying uncontrollably.
* What else could he do? He couldn’t move, so he sat. It’s weird imagining a tree trying to sit…
