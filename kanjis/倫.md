## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> puts their <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hat</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> next to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bookshelf</span>. This is a test in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ethics</span>.
* People hang around the bookshelf, and the leader wants to see if anyone will steal the hat or not. That's why its a test of ethics.
* To test your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ethics</span> even more, the leader puts down a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rin</span>g (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りん](https://jisho.org/search/りん)</span>) as well.
* Now we'll really see how everyone's ethics are. Will they turn in the ring to lost in found? will they ignore it? Will they steal it?
