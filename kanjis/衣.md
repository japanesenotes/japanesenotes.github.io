## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> clothes</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clothes</span> kanji are exactly the same! Surprising!
* 
* An <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>) sees a pile of your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> clothes</span> and lays an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> e</span>gg (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [え](https://jisho.org/search/え)</span>) in them. The eagle’s egg needs a soft warm place to incubate, and your pile of clothes are the perfect place.
* Look at the eagle and her egg sitting atop your clothes. Every time you get close the eagle starts to screech at you fiercely. Screee! Screee!
