## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gambler</span> sets <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fire</span> to his home in order to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bake</span> some goods and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cook</span> a turkey. Setting his house on fire isn’t exactly the brightest idea, but the gambler is taking a gamble that the things he baked and cooked in the fire will offset the cost of a new home. <br />This kanji also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> burn</span>, because when you cook or bake something for too long, that's exactly what it does.
* Feel the fiery flames around you as you smell the smell of baked goods and cooked meat in your nostrils.
* This gambler used to play for the New York <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ya</span>nkees (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [や](https://jisho.org/search/や)</span>). He had a pitching injury, developed a gambling problem, and also took up some hobbies to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bake</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cook</span>. Certainly a departure from his time with the Yankees.
* Imagine this guy running around cooking in the fire of his home, only this time with a Yankees hat and jersey on. He doesn’t play for them anymore, but he still loves the team.
