## Mnemonics
 * If you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> something the same way they say it in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> capital</span>, everyone in the whole country will be able to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> comprehend</span> what you're trying to say. If you try to speak in your hometown's dialect no one will. But everyone can comprehend what you want if you use the capital's dialect to say it.
* Imagine the confused faces of the people in the countryside as you try to talk to them. Decide to say it the way it's said in the capital and see their faces light up as they comprehend what you're trying to say.
* Now that the townspeople finally <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> comprehend</span> what you were trying to say, they sell you the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> row</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りょう](https://jisho.org/search/りょう)</span>) boat you were trying to buy. You were using the wrong word, but <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りょう](https://jisho.org/search/りょう)</span> is what they needed to hear to understand you, and now you can row your way back home.
* Picture yourself rowing away in your new row boat as the townspeople wave goodbye. They were much nicer once they comprehended what you were asking for. Maybe you'll row your way back here someday.
