## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> that wants <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> peace</span> can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> call</span> for it. If you don’t have a mouth, you can’t call for peace. So use your mouth and call for peace when you can. Peace is great.
* Call for peace. Say it aloud. I’m using my mouth to call for peace!
* But before you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> call</span> for peace, you must first placate the masses. To do so, you astound them with your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>-yo (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よ](https://jisho.org/search/よ)</span>) skills. Once they are so entranced by how talented you are with a yo-yo, you easily convince them to make peace.
* Imagine yourself whirling this yo-yo about while you call for peace. Imagine yourself doing a variety of tricks with it as you slowly convince the people to agree to peace.
