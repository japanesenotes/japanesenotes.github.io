## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> of water to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> root</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> good</span>. It's good for the roots to grow and live and thrive. And what's good for roots is good for our plants and us humans too.
* Imagine putting a little drop of water over a root you want to grow. Doing this is good for the plant and also good for your soul.
* A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> good</span> way to get a lot of drops of water for your roots is to buy a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> row</span> boat (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りょう](https://jisho.org/search/りょう)</span>). Then just row out to the middle of the lake and plonk all the roots right into the source!
* Rowing even feels good on your arms and back. Probably just as good as all these roots will feel.
