## Mnemonics
 * In a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> coffin</span> is someone <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> begging</span>. But, it won't work. You won't listen. So, the man in the coffin just begins to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> think</span>: What could I have done better in my life? Why am I in this situation? How will I get out? Think, damnit, think!!
* Imagine him changing from a begging position to a stereotypical thinking position, hand on chin, eyebrows furrowed. Focus on the beggar's thinking. This is a pretty abstract idea to imagine, so it will be important to create a very vivid picture in your mind's eye.
* What is the beggar <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> think</span>ing of? A thought bubble pops up into existence near his head. In it is a picture of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>! He's thinking that if <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> was here, he'd save him. Oh, if only <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> could save us all!
* Then, the beggar realizes that he is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span>. You're burying <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> in a coffin alive and all he can think of is himself.
