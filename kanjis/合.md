## Mnemonics
 * The radical <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> suit</span> and the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suit</span> are exactly the same! This kanji can also mean <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> join</span> which makes sense. When something suits you well, like a hat or something, it joins together with you quite well too. Join me, my hat! You suit my head well. It just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fit</span>s, you know?
* Just remember that this suit means to suit you - not the thing you wear, okay!
* You need someone who will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suit</span> you. Someone who can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> join</span> you on your life journey. So you call <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ごういち</span>.
* Imagine you two standing next to each other, posing for a photograph. You two suit each other well. <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ごういち](https://jisho.org/search/ごういち)</span> with his gray beard, and you with your [well, you have to fill in this part by yourself].
