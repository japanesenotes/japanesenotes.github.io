## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> go</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> go</span> kanji are exactly the same!
* If you know your radicals well enough (and you do), you'll know this kanji.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Go</span>! someone is telling you. Go! Go! Go! That person is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>. He is holding his finger out, and pointing at your WaniKani reviews. Go! Go! Then, he over-enunciates the word go by saying <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> GYOU!</span>! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎょう](https://jisho.org/search/ぎょう)</span>).
* You try to go another direction, and he just yells and points louder: GO!
