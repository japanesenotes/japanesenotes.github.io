## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> has <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> clothes</span> that he is quite <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reliant</span> on. The leader needs his clothes to make him look like a leader. The leader has become more reliant on his clothes than he is on his actual skills as a leader!
* Imagine this leader in his clothes. Look how reliant he is on them. Imagine what he would be without his clothes – nothing! And also, naked.
* The leader has become so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reliant</span> on his clothes that his judgment has been clouded. His kingdom has become infested with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gles (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>) but the leader does nothing, trusting that his clothes will rout out the eagles if it is something that needs to be done. He’s become so reliant on his clothes that he’s started to become not so good a leader anymore.
* Look at the leader as he shouts at his clothes he’s become so reliant on to do something. Hear the countless eagles screeching around as they terrorize the neighborhood. People scream and weep in the streets.
