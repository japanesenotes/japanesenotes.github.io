## Mnemonics
 * The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> old</span> first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> old</span> as well.<br />Note: This old does not refer to people. Think of it as old things instead.
* Make sure you know those radicals, yo!
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Old</span> things are misunderstood by the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 子</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span>) of the world.<br />*Note:* Come up with a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span> character you can use for all the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span> reading mnemonics going forward. This child will show up many times throughout your mnemonic journey, and it will help if you imagine the same character the whole time.
* Imagine a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span> looking at old things. A record player. A gameboy. A cassette player. Kids just don't get old things.<br />Note: When you see the (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [古](https://jisho.org/search/古)</span>) radical in a kanji, there's a good chance it will use the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span>.
