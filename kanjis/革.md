## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leather</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> leather</span> kanji are exactly the same! Cool!
* 
* One way to get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> leather</span> is to skin a male chicken, a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かく](https://jisho.org/search/かく)</span>). You won’t get much leather from a cock, but you can definitely skin one in a pinch, should you need a little extra leather.
* Imagine skinning a cock for its leather. See yourself cutting through the rooster’s skin as you pluck the feathers out so it can be tanned into leather.
