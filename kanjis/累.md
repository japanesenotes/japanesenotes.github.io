## Mnemonics
 * You start growing <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accumulate</span> more. You didn't want to have to buy any, so you're just trying to grow thread with your rice. That seems like a good way to accumulate more to you.
* Just imagine how much thread you'll accumulate if you can just grow it along with your rice in the rice paddy! So much thread!
* Sadly, this is a terrible way to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> accumulate</span> anything thread related and you ended up <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rui</span>ning (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [るい](https://jisho.org/search/るい)</span>) your rice paddy too. I guess if you want to accumulate thread this isn't the way to do it.
* Your attempts to accumulate more of something by cheating have brought ruin to everything else you were doing. Nice job, dummy.
