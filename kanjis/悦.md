## Mnemonics
 * If you can <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> guard</span> your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> soul</span> from bad things you'll always feel <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> delight</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> joy</span>. It's hard to guard your soul from everything though, so take all the joy you can, while you can.
* Imagine guarding yourself from all the bad things in the world. No more politics, religion, internet trolls debating the two, it's all guarded from your precious soul. Ahhh, it's so joyous to be unburdened.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> delight</span> you feel is so great that it becomes permanently <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> etch</span>ed (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [えつ](https://jisho.org/search/えつ)</span>) in your soul and even your face.
* Picture joy etched on your own face. No one can get you down.
