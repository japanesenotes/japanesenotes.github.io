## Mnemonics
 * In a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gold</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span>, you see a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> needle</span> sticking out of it. The needle is right in the middle of the gold cross. If Jesus were on there, the needle would be sticking him right in the chest.
* Picture this golden cross in your head. Why do you suppose there’s this needle stuck in it? You try to pull it out but you can’t. Envision yourself straining, trying to get the thing out.
* You're about to give up on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> needle</span> when it pops out and flies directly into your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shin</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しん](https://jisho.org/search/しん)</span>). Ouch! Now you're desperately trying to pull the needle out of your shin, but it really won't budge this time. Maybe you should have minded your own business.
* Imagine a needle sticking into your shin. It hurts a ton. How would you try to get it out?
