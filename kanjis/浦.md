## Mnemonics
 * If you want to have a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> at your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> wedding</span>, you need to make sure you have it at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bay</span>. Anywhere more inland, and the tsunami won't reach it in time.
* Picture the tsunami coming towards your beautiful wedding as you stand by the bay. It's not safe, but it's memorable!
* How did you get a tsunami to show up in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bay</span> in the first place? By throwing a bunch of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ura</span>nium (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [うら](https://jisho.org/search/うら)</span>) in there, of course! Its highly unstable nature can make any body of water, especially a calm bay, turn violent.
* Imagine throwing buckets of uranium into the bay. It only burns your hands a little. And now they glow green, just like the bay does!
