## Mnemonics
 * If you see someone <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eye</span>ing your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> womb</span> you're probably going to be weirded out by how <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> friendly</span> they're acting. You only let people who are really, really close to you look at your womb. So if this guy is acting that friendly he should have introduced himself first.
* Imagine having someone you aren't friendly with trying to have a look at your womb. No thank you.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> friendly</span> guy comes up to you and start to introduce himself, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ぼく</span>- but you stop him. He's been getting way too friendly with your womb and you don't want to hear who he is. He can <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼく](https://jisho.org/search/ぼく)</span> at someone else, you're out.
* Imagine only letting this guy start to introduce himself with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼく](https://jisho.org/search/ぼく)</span> before walking the heck outta there. Just because he was acting friendly doesn't mean he was actually your friend.
