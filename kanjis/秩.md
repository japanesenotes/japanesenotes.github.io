## Mnemonics
 * If a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grain</span> has a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fault</span>, it needs to be put back in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> order</span>. Grains must be perfectly identical at all times, otherwise they'll be thrown out. That's why special people will go out and check them to confirm their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> regularity</span>. Keeping order is a tough job!
* Imagine being one of these people who maintain order by going out in the fields and inspecting every single grain, keeping the good ones and plucking off the ones with faults.
* You can always tell if a company keeps <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> order</span> or if it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cheats</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちつ](https://jisho.org/search/ちつ)</span>) just by looking at the grains.
* If there are faulty grains in there, they cheated and order was not maintained. Now you have to go through all the grains and throw out the weird ones yourself.
