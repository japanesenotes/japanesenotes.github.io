## Mnemonics
 * What do you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> guard</span>? Your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> theory</span> about how the thing he's guarding isn't even real. Yeah, you have this whole thing figured out. You have for a while. At this point, it's only fair that you tell your theory to the guard who's wasting his time.
* Imagine saying your theory out loud to a guard about how what he's guarding isn't even there. Imagine how he would react.
* The guard listens to your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> theory</span> but then he says his OWN! He thinks there are two <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sets</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せつ](https://jisho.org/search/せつ)</span>) of guarded items, and he's only guarding one. According to his theory, either one could be real! His theory is more plausible, don't you think?
* Which theory do you believe? That there is nothing or that there are sets of things?
