## Mnemonics
 * With a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span>, a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lion</span> sews together all the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice</span> he'll <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inherit</span> from his parents one day. He's convinced his parents are going to try to keep some of his inheritance from him, so he's linking it all together so it can't go anywhere.
* Picture this lion surrounded by the thousands of grains of rice he'll inherit from his parents. He's carefully threading them all together.
* If you're going to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inherit</span> something from your parents, try to convince them to make it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>ke (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けい](https://jisho.org/search/けい)</span>), not rice. A single cake is much easier to keep track of and probably tastier (though it will be super stale by the time they die).
* I'd much rather inherit a cake than a ton of hard to keep track of rice, like this poor lion.
