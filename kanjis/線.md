## Mnemonics
 * If someone falls overboard while you're <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> white</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> water </span>rafting, you can use a long piece of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> as a life <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> line</span>. Sure it might be thin, but a line of thread is better than nothing. Throw them a line and drag them back aboard! Those white water rapids are vicious.
* Imagine you're the person who fell overboard. The white water is rushing violently and it is deathly cold. Feel the water and freezing temperature on your skin. But look! Someone has thrown you a line of thread! You're saved!
* The person who threw you that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> line</span> of thread is actually a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cen</span>taur (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span>). How kind of him. After you are safe you hop on the centaur's back and ride around to get the wind to dry you off.
* Coming out of the rushing water, this centaur is like an angel sent from heaven. He's just saved your life. Imagine the happiness and gratitude you feel towards this centaur as you are pulled to safety by that line of thread.
