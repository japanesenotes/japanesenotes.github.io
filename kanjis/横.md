## Mnemonics
 * Yellow tree is kinda like a traffic light. If you look at a traffic light sideways, it looks green. Therefore, turning your head HORIZONTAL is good.<br><br><br>The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> marked with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> yellow</span> X on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> side</span> of the house is going to get cut down. You’ve marked it with a yellow X so the hired help knows which tree to cut down. There are a lot of trees on the side of the house, but the tree marked with a yellow X is the only one in danger of causing damage to your roof in the event of a storm.
* Picture the scene of a woman with a chainsaw cutting down this tree marked with a yellow X. Hear the sound of the chainsaw buzzing and the grinding of wood as it meets the side of the trunk. It’s very loud. Woodchips go flying everywhere.
* Wait, that woman with the chainsaw is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Yoko</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よこ](https://jisho.org/search/よこ)</span>) Ono! Yes, the same Yoko Ono who’s married to John Lennon of the Beatles. What’s she doing chopping down trees on the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> side</span> of your house? Who can say. Silly Yoko.
* Now picture the same scene as before only imagining Yoko Ono wielding that chainsaw. Maybe she’s dancing. Maybe there’s some Beatles music playing in the background. Either way it’s a strange sight – remember it.
