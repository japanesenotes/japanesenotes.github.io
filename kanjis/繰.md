## Mnemonics
 * You have <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> and some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> syrup</span> and you need to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spin</span> them together. Drip the syrup onto the thread and spin it around and around over your head.
* Imagine carefully dripping syrup onto a thread and then spinning it in a circle.
* As you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> spin</span> the syrup, it begins to change shape and forms into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coo</span>kie (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [く](https://jisho.org/search/く)</span>)! Haven't you ever made syrup-spun cookies before? The spinning forms and cooks them in the air.
* Imagine eating a syrup cookie you made by spinning it yourself. Homemade is always better than store-bought.
