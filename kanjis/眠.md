## Mnemonics
 * Closing each <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eye</span> is something that the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> peoples</span> do before they <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sleep</span>. The peoples can’t sleep with both eyes open and they can’t sleep with just one eye open either. Peoples have to close each eye before they can sleep.
* You are one of these peoples, so imagine yourself closing your eyes and sleeping. Go ahead and do it right now. Close one eye, and then the other. Now imagine yourself sleeping.
* The reason you want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sleep</span> is because all the other peoples were <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mean</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みん](https://jisho.org/search/みん)</span>) to you. They were so mean that the only way you could get over it was to close your eyes and sleep. You just want to sleep.
* Those other peoples were really mean to you. Imagine all the mean things they were saying to you. What did they say? Think about all these mean things as you close your eyes and drift off to sleep. Also keep in mind that this kanji has the same reading as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [民](https://jisho.org/search/民)</span>, which is included in this kanji.
