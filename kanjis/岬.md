## Mnemonics
 * You see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mountain</span> in the shape of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turtle shell</span> sticking out into the ocean. It's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cape</span>! No, not the kind you wear, the geographical kind. When you're on land, most capes look like turtle shell mountains sticking out into the sea. Do you know any capes like that near where you live?
* Picture the turtle shell shaped cape. Feel the salty wind in your hair!
* You decide to walk along this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cape</span> because it looks like the perfect place to get rid of your old <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> me</span>at <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sack</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みさき](https://jisho.org/search/みさき)</span>). It's starting to smell, but the ocean breeze from the cape pulls the meat sack out of your hands and off into the sky (then probably into the sea too).
* The next time you go to the cape, remember to bring your old, used meat sack. You can toss it right into the ocean and it won't bother you ever again! Just make sure no one sees you.
