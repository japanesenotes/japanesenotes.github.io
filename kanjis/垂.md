## Mnemonics
 * This <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> car</span> is all weird because it looks like the side is going to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dangle</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> drip</span> off or something. The front bumper of the car is dangling off and the sides of the car look like they could drip off at any moment.
* Compare this kanji to the car kanji, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [車](https://jisho.org/search/車)</span>. See how the sides and top are different? Use that to remember that this car looks like it’s falling apart. See the parts dangle, and hear the drip of car fluids falling out. This car is a wreck.
* You see the parts as they <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dangle</span> off the car and you get an idea. You could probably <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> swi</span>ng (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すい](https://jisho.org/search/すい)</span>) on these dangling parts. The parts can probably take some weight still before they <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> drip</span> off the car, so you might as well swing around on them while you still can.
* Imagine yourself swinging off these dangling car parts. Hear the car creak and groan as you swing around on it, causing more fluid to drip out of the car.
