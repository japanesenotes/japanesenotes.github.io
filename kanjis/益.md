## Mnemonics
 * There are some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> next to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fins</span> on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> plate</span> that are meant to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> benefit</span> everyone. If you're a member of this town, one of your benefits is this little set up.
* You pick up the horns off the ground and put them on your head, then eat some fins off the plate. This is just one of many benefits to living here. You'll never go hungry!
* Another <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> benefit</span> is free <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 駅</span> usage! Whenever you come back home from places on the train, this <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [駅](https://jisho.org/search/駅)</span> is completely free.
* Okay, so using the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [駅](https://jisho.org/search/駅)</span> is probably a better benefit than eating cold fins off a plate on the ground, but you take what you can get. They're all free!
