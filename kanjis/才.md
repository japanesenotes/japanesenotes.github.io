* Imagine yourself placing the barbs in front of the slide, thinking about how your genius plan will surely catch another genius.
* You check your genius trap, and there's a genius stuck in the barbs! You know it's a genius because they're actually a cyborg (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さい](https://jisho.org/search/さい)</span>).
