## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dog</span> radical and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dog</span> kanji are exactly the same!
* Soon there will be very few kanji/radical-same combos ... so enjoy it while you can.
* You see an emu running towards you from off in the distance (strange to see an emu in these parts...). As it gets closer, you realize that it's not an emu at all, it's something that sounds the same, or similar... an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inu</span>!
* There's a good chance you know the word for dog in Japanese already too. If so, you're ahead of the game. If not, do your best to learn the reading before moving on.
