## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> of your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> branch</span> became the leader from doing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deed</span>s. You can't rise to the rank of branch leader if you don't perform a certain number of deeds! Most of them good, I hope.
* Picture the leader of your branch doing deeds around your office. Pulling out chairs for people sitting down, emptying the trash, balancing spreadsheets. All good deeds.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deed</span> he's currently working on is finding your lost <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>). He doesn't have to help, you're the one who lost your own house-combination-car key. But he's so used to doing deeds, he can't help but help.
* Picture him doing this deed. He's crawling around on the floor looking for your key. You aren't really helping, you're just watching him do the deed of key-searching for you.
