Your mouth fills with the taste of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 鉄</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てつ](https://jisho.org/search/てつ)</span>).
* The clear, penetrating beam tastes exactly like iron, which is something you really weren't expecting. But now it's filling your entire mouth and you don't want it to stop.
