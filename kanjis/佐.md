## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> narwhal</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> construction</span> crew needs all the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> help</span> he can get. The narwhals are beginning construction on an underwater city. The leader knows the narwhals are hard construction workers, but they’ll need some help building this city.
* Imagine being the narwhal leader and asking others for help. Ask a shark for help. Ask a whale for help. Ask a shrimp for help. Go on, ask.
* Then you discover a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> saw</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さ](https://jisho.org/search/さ)</span>) who would be a great big <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> help</span>. This saw is very strong and would help you and your narwhal construction team out a lot. You should make use of this saw right away.
* Imagine using this saw and realizing how big of a help it is. Hear the saw sawing away as you and your fellow narwhals get to work.
