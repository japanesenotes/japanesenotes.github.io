## Mnemonics
 * If a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> hits, it's <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rain</span>ing, and you're outside trying to use a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rake</span>, you're going to be very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wet</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> damp</span>.
* Imagine how wet and damp you'd be with tsunami water up to your knees and rain pouring down on your head. You struggle with your rake anyway.
* You can't stand how <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wet</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> damp</span> you feel in these clothes so you rip them off and rake in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nu</span>de (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぬ](https://jisho.org/search/ぬ)</span>)!
* You're still wet, but at least you don't have the feeling of damp clothes touching your body now. You'll have to be really careful raking in the nude though.
