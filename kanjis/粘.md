## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fortune</span> is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sticky</span>. Rice is sticky. So is your rice fortune. Your fortune of rice is sticky because it is made up entirely of sticky rice.
* Look at this sticky rice fortune of yours. Run your hands through it and feel the sticky rice between your fingers. Hear the sticky sucking sounds and you stir the sticky rice about.
* This rice is so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sticky</span> that you are able to sculpt <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nen</span>doroids (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ねん](https://jisho.org/search/ねん)</span>) from it. Your rice fortune is worth even more now that you are hand making limited edition nendoroids from it.
* Imagine sculpting these sticky rice nendoroids with your bare hands. Feel the sticky rice between your fingers as you smush the rice into cure little nendoroids.
