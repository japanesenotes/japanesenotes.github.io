## Mnemonics
 * If you grind <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice</span>, every <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> part</span> of it, eventually it will become a fine <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> powder</span>. You can then use this rice powder as a part to create some other dish. Some kind of cake, perhaps.
* Imagine yourself grinding this rice into a powder. Hear the scrape of the rice on stone as you grind it down to the finest powder.
* Actually, grinding the rice down to a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> powder</span> is super <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fun</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふん](https://jisho.org/search/ふん)</span>). It’s so fun you don’t want to stop! AH HAHAHAHA! RICE POWDER! SO FUN!
* Okay, we got a little carried away there. Just keep in mind how fun this is. Make sure you say fun with a little bit of a Scottish accent. You know what they say, Scotts have more fun!
