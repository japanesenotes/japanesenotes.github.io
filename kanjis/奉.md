## Mnemonics
 * When <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spring</span> is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dry</span> you need to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dedicate</span> your time and effort somewhere else. You can't plant flowers or vegetables, it's too dry. You can't play outside, your skin will flake. So you need to dedicate yourself to something inside.
* You know how you get. When you can't go outside, you dedicate yourself full force into something else. I mean, you made it to level 55, right? That's some serious dedication. And it probably started because of one particularly dry spring.
* You decide to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dedicate</span> yourself to your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ho</span>me (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほう](https://jisho.org/search/ほう)</span>). You don't want to be outside in the dry spring air, so you focus on home activities. You can clean the kitchen, build a shelf, or dedicate your time to your home internet system.
* Dedicate yourself to doing things in your home! Haha, who are we kidding, you already did that.<br />We love you, nerd. ♡
