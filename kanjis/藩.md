## Mnemonics
 * You have to reach a certain <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> number</span> of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span>s hits to become a legitimate <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fiefdom</span>. At least in the old days. If you don't meet one of these conditions, like if you get hit by tsunamis all the time but you only have two or three flowers that will grow, you can't be your own fiefdom.
* Imagine being the person who has to check whether each fiefdom has enough flowers and tsunamis per year to keep their status.
* The most famous <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fiefdom</span> checker is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Han</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はん](https://jisho.org/search/はん)</span>) Solo. He takes his Millennium Falcon and swoops around checking for flowers and signs of past tsunamis and then he'll either say you can or cannot be your own fiefdom. Thanks Han Solo!
* Picture Han Solo flying around Japan checking to make sure all the fiefdoms are up to code.
