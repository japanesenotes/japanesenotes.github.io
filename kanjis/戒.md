 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span> issued <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> twenty</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> commandment</span>s to his people.
* He basically just made up a bunch of commandments to order all the other drunkards around and decided having twenty (twice the amount of that other religion he heard about) would be a good number.

* Commandment 1: Thou shalt not touch my kayak<br />Commandment 2: Thou shalt not look at my kayak<br />Commandment 3: Thou shalt give me beer to put in my kayak<br />It goes on like that for a while...
