## Mnemonics
 * When a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> comes, the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> brush</span> makes a good safe <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> haven</span>. Thick brush is a haven from tsunamis because the brush will break the tsunami water and keep you safe and dry.
* Imagine being in the haven of a brush while a tsunami strikes. Hear the water crash and rush all around you while you remain safe in your haven.
* The only downside about this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> haven</span> is that there’s only room for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> two</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つ](https://jisho.org/search/つ)</span>) people in the brush. The brush isn’t big enough for more than two people, so unless you have a lot of brush, you won’t be saving many people from the tsunami.
* Since there is room for two people in the brush, imagine yourself in the haven with one other person. They and you make two. The other person is a real whiner though - imagine them crying the whole time.
