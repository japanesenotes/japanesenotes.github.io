## Mnemonics
 * When you ride a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> you'll have a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> surplus</span> of possible <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> route</span>s. Not only can you drive on any road, but you can ride on the sidewalk too!
* Okay, so it might not be legal to take the sidewalk route depending on where you live, but physically, you can do whatever you want because scooters are small.
* You decide to take the fastest <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> route</span>, since you have so many options, and drive on the sidewalk. However, in doing so you run over every single <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> toe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [と](https://jisho.org/search/と)</span>) on every single person trying to walk there.
* Psh, whatever. They aren't your toes, and this is the fastet route! You'll name it the toe route and do whatever you want.
