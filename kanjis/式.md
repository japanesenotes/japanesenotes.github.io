## Mnemonics
 * To <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> construct</span> a whole <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ceremony</span>, you can’t just make it up on the spot. That is not a ceremony. A ceremony has a past. A ceremony is done a certain way because that’s the way it’s always been done. In short, to build a ceremony, you have to create a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ritual</span> first. Then, the ritual can be constructed into a bigger, more lavish ceremony.<br />This kanji also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> equation</span> for some reason too. Just think of a ceremony that involves doing math and coming up with equations. How strange would that be? Pretend you're at this ceremony.
* Ritual and Ceremony kind of mean the same things, sort of. Don't worry too much if you mix them up a little - both will help you to remember the other. There's a reason this kanji is made up of the ceremony radical already!
* So, you’re at a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ritual</span>. Think of the most ridiculous ceremony you can think of. Give it a shot – I’ll let you come up with the ridiculousness this time (it’s good practice). When you think of your mnemonic, make sure to imagine it with a Sheikh (an Arabic leader). Have the sheikh do something ridiculous to help you to think of this sheikh (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しき](https://jisho.org/search/しき)</span>) and then remember this on’yomi.
* It’s good to practice making your own mnemonics up every once in a while. It’ll help you to add on to the mnemonics already here and make better ones more personal to yourself!
