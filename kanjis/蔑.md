## Mnemonics
 * In a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> net</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span>s down like a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span>. There they stay, an icon of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scorn</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neglect</span>.
* It's embarrassing to fall down a flowers net while drunk. Despite that, there you are. Everyone who goes by scorns you or neglects you.
* Every time you receive <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> scorn</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neglect</span> from someone walking by, you say in your drunken voice: I <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bets you</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [べつ](https://jisho.org/search/べつ)</span>) I can get up if I want. I bets you I can.
* You try to get up, but no matter how much you bets you someone that you can get up, you slide back down the flowers net. I bets you I can do it next time, you say.
