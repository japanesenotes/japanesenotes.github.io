## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sheep</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sheep</span> kanji are the same in looks as well in meaning.
* You are no sheep—you study your radicals, unlike most Japanese learners. You'll learn sooo much faster!
* To remember <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よう](https://jisho.org/search/よう)</span>, we use the word Yogurt. The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sheep</span> are after you. There are too many of them, and they're chasing you down, stalking you... because you stole their sheep's milk <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>gurt (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よう](https://jisho.org/search/よう)</span>). Now you're running and crying and trying to eat the yogurt before the sheep catch up and stomp you down with their hooves.
* Imagine the taste of this yogurt. You're scared and tired from running, but it tastes great!
