## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span> takes his <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span> into his private <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> jet</span> and is given a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pearl</span> as a gift, by you! He's letting you ride in his jet today, and you were told the king should be presented with a pearl as soon as he boards.
* Imagine giving this gorgeous white pearl to the king after he slides down his slide and boards the jet. See his king face light up as he sees the pretty pearl.
* The king takes the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pearl</span> and tosses it into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chu</span>te (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅ](https://jisho.org/search/しゅ)</span>) next to the slide he took to get into the jet. You watch as the pearl goes down, down, down until it lands into a huge vat of pearls.
* Oh. I guess the king didn't need your pearl, since he has a pearl chute to get them off his jet before takeoff. You feel silly. And you kind of want to jump into the pearl chute yourself.
