## Mnemonics
 * Taking a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> and moving to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sound</span> of the music, a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span> makes a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> weave</span> through some fabric. He’s using the thread to weave his clothes back together after he damaged them in a fall down the stairs. You know, because he’s a drunkard.
* Imagine this drunkard bipping and bopping to the sound of the music as he weaves this thread through his clothes to repair them.
* This drunkard is actually a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Sheikh</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しき](https://jisho.org/search/しき)</span>) (an Arabic leader), but he’s just fallen on hard times and has been hitting the bottle pretty hard lately. The piece of clothing he is using the thread to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> weave</span> back together is one of his fancy formal robes.
* Imagine this drunken Sheikh again, only this time he is moving to the sound of some Arabic music. You know what that sounds like, right?
