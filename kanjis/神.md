## Mnemonics
 * You should have a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spirit</span> that's <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> humble</span> when before a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> god</span>. You never really have to act all nice and humble before anyone else, but if you meet a god... well... you should probably lower yourself appropriately. They can smite you and all that.
* Imagine a spirit appearing before you. It's a god. You should be as humble as possible. Out of respect and also because you don't want to be cursed or something.
* When you see a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> god</span>, you need to get down on your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shin</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しん](https://jisho.org/search/しん)</span>). Get down on your ankles? No, not low enough. Knees? No, no, get your shins flat on the ground to show how humble you really are.
* If you don't get down on your shins before god, they could take them away. You don't want to live a shin-less life, do you?
