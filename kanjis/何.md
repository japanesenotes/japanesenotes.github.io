## Mnemonics
 * Our <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> has a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lip ring</span>. Wait, our leader has a lip ring? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> WHAT</span>??
* Think of our president (or your prime minister, or dictator, or whatever) and imagine this person appearing on television one morning with a big ol' lip ring. Feel surprised by it. Just say What?? over and over again. You want to have the feeling of what in you when you imagine this - that'll help you to remember this kanji's meaning.
* The leader with his lip ring is now eating some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> naan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なん](https://jisho.org/search/なん)</span>) and curry. It's delicious, of course... but then he gets it caught on his lip ring, and tears half his lip off. He screams: Nannnnn eeeeeeeeeehhh!! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なに](https://jisho.org/search/なに)</span>) in anger at the naan and curry.
* Make this one vivid and scary. He's eating the naan (that's your <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なん](https://jisho.org/search/なん)</span>), and then he screams at the naan but gets overwhelmed with pain (that's the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なに](https://jisho.org/search/なに)</span>). Smell the naan (you're there) and see the blood gushing out of his/her lip. It's terrifying. How did the naan even catch on his lip ring anyways?
