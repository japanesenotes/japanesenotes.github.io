## Mnemonics
 * There's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> toe</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> below</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span>.
* So, where is the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> toe</span> now? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> below</span> ground. Imagine yourself digging it out, and thinking... ugh, why does it have to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> below</span> ground like this? So irritating. Will I be able to sew it back on in time to save it?
* You keep digging for the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> toe</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> below</span> the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span>, and instead of hitting a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> toe</span> you hit something hard and metallic. You keep digging and digging around it, but it's huge. Turns out, you found yourself a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> car</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>). Keep digging until you unearth the car. Inside, you find the toe you were looking for.
* There's another useful on'yomi reading that just isn't useful enough for you to learn now. That reading is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [げ](https://jisho.org/search/げ)</span>, but we're only going to worry about that much, much later when you have to learn one or two vocab words that read <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [下](https://jisho.org/search/下)</span> as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [げ](https://jisho.org/search/げ)</span>. That's the problem with really common kanji - too many readings.
