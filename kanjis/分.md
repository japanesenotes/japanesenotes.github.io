## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fins</span> that fell onto my <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sword</span> were sliced into two <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> parts</span>.
* The logic of this story makes a lot of sense - even in the kanji itself the fins are falling onto the sword from above. What happens to things that fall onto swords? They become more than one <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> part</span>.
* Now that you've cut the fish, it's time to cut something else into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> parts</span>. Next on your list is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> buns</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶん](https://jisho.org/search/ぶん)</span>) which need to be split up amongst the people. If you'd like to learn the second reading, just think about how <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fun</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふん](https://jisho.org/search/ふん)</span>) it will be to do this task.
* Think about the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> buns</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶん](https://jisho.org/search/ぶん)</span>) as absolutely delicious things you want to eat really bad. If you want to eat the buns, and you taste the buns in your imagination, you'll surely remember that the reading for this kanji is <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふん](https://jisho.org/search/ふん)</span> as well.
