 * You take <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gold</span> in exchange for executing <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> orders</span> to construct a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> buzzer</span>. You are a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> small bell</span> maker and someone orders you to make one into a buzzer exchange for some gold. This is how you make a living.
* Imagine the gold, heavy in your pockets, as you construct this buzzer with your bare hands. Feel the cool metal clink around in your hands as you put it together.
* Finally the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> buzzer</span> is done. You’ve earned your gold. You test the buzzer and it goes <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rin</span>g (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りん](https://jisho.org/search/りん)</span>)! Ring! Ring! Ring! Ring ring ring ring ring! Man, that ringing is annoying but hey, that’s what buzzers do.
* Wait, should this buzzer be buzzing or ringing? Oh well, you got your gold. It’s the client’s problem now.
