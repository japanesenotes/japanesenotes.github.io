## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> clan</span> is where you get your name. But not your given name, your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> family name</span>. That's why people have names that mean in a rice paddy and near the ferry crossing. The location of your clan determined your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> surname</span>! Hope your ancestors didn't live on Poo Lake or something.
* Think about your own surname in your language. Where did it come from? Were you a clan of village dwellers? Maybe you made shoes! You should look it up and find out!
* Don't worry, I'll tell you where your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> family name</span> came from. Your family used to herd <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>). You read that right, your family was of the sheep clan because you took care of sheep all day.
* Imagine your ancestors, herding sheep. Thanks to them your name means sheep people. Thanks great great great great great grand pappy.
