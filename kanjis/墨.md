## Mnemonics
 * You use <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> black</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> to make <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> black ink</span>. That's what you use to write in black!
* Make sure the dirt you're using to make black ink is really, really black. Like the kind you find around volcanoes or something.
* Be careful that you don't spill <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> black ink</span> on anyone or anything. If you do, you have to own it. Imagine spilling black ink on someone, and when they confront you yelling, Yeah I got black ink on you, so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue me</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すみ](https://jisho.org/search/すみ)</span>)!
* Imagine yelling SUE ME! at someone's face, which is covered in the black ink you spilled there.
