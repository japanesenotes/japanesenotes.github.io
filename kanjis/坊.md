## Mnemonics
 * Can you look at the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> and know which <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> direction</span> you need to go? Then you might be a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> monk</span>. Monks have amazing skills like that. And I'm sure you've seen monks wandering around in lots of media. They don't need maps or smartphones. They just look at the dirt and let the earth guide them to where they need to be.
* Picture a monk walking through a large field in the middle of nowhere. He knows where to go, he's not afraid. The dirt will lead him in the right direction.
* You want to know the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> monk</span>'s trick so you hide behind him for a while as he walks. Finally the monk stops, looks around, takes out a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bow</span>ling (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼう](https://jisho.org/search/ぼう)</span>) ball and starts bowling in the dirt. The bowling ball rolls off, the monk follows it, and then heads off in that direction.
* Imagine a monk bowling in the middle of the road. Imagine your shock at how well he handles the ball. Also, imagine how heavy it must be for a monk to carry a bowling ball everywhere!
