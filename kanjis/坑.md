## Mnemonics
 * In the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span>, you find a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lid</span> under the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> table</span>. You lift it to reveal a deep <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pit</span>. Why is there a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hole</span> under your table?
* You pull away the lid and crawl inside. There is a ladder that takes you deep into the pit.
* When you reach the bottom of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pit</span>, you hear someone scuffling around and the sounds of chains. You light a match and inch closer to see what it is. In the darkness, you see <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>, starved and chained in a pit under your table.
* After you've nursed <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> back to health, he explains that he was put here by a clone <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span>–the very same <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> who became emperor. He tells you he can think of around 61-70 different pain levels of revenge, but also that it probably wouldn't be worth it, so let's just hang out for a while instead. Ooh, are those cookies?
