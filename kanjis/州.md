## Mnemonics
 * Think about Japan. Japan is a country made up of islands. They're basically three <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span>s in the large <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> river</span> that is the Pacific Ocean. These are Japan's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> states</span> or <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> province</span>s.
* Also, another way to think of this is that the river radical is actually just three rivers, separating drops, which are capitals of various states. Rivers are usually great ways to divide up a country, and states are one way to do it!
* Each <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> state</span> has its own <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shoe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅう](https://jisho.org/search/しゅう)</span>) to represent it. The bottom of each shoe is the shape of the state, so when you step it leaves a state-shaped imprint in the ground.
* The state shoes also have things like the state birds, state flowers, and state fish printed on each of them. They're quite collectable, you should buy a pair for your favorite state!
