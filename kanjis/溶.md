## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> hits your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> form</span> and you begin to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> melt</span>. You are a witch and water makes you melt. The tsunami is a lot of water, so once it touches your form, you begin to melt.
* Feel the water from the tsunami crashing into your form. Feel the water on your body as your form begins to melt. I’m melting! I’m mellltiinnnggg!
* The only way to reverse the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> melt</span> process is to eat some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>gurt (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よう](https://jisho.org/search/よう)</span>). The yogurt counteracts the melting from the water and your form will become whole again. Quick, eat some yogurt!
* Feel the melt begin to reverse as you eat your yogurt. Taste the yogurt on your tongue as your form begins to solidify once again.
