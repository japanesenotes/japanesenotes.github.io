## Mnemonics
 * What's more <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> simple</span> than a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bow</span>? A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bullet</span>. Bullets just have to be shot out of a gun and somebody dies. Bows you have to load with an arrow and pull it back and aim, yuck. Bullets are the new bows, people.
* Imagine how simple life would be if we replaced all the bows in the world with bullets. (Insert sarcastic crying face here.)
* If you want to shoot <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bullet</span>s, you need to do it at <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dawn</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だん](https://jisho.org/search/だん)</span>). Back in the old days, it wasn't bright enough to shoot arrows at dawn, but you can shoot bullets at dawn because they're simpler to use!
* Imagine shooting bullets into the sun at dawn. Pow pow, take that history! Blam blam, take that dawn!
