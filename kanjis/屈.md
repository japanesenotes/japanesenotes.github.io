## Mnemonics
 * You see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span> by the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> exit</span> letting you know to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yield</span>. There’s cross traffic just outside the exit, and the flag lets you know that you need to yield to them.
* Look at this flag telling you to yield. Now look through the exit right by the flag. You can see a bunch of people out there walking. Imagine standing by the exit, yielding to the other people until you have an opening. Hear the hustle and bustle of the people as you wait.
* Even though the flag told you to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yield</span>, you’re starting to lose your patience. The people walking outside the exit are all a bunch of crazy old <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coots</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くつ](https://jisho.org/search/くつ)</span>)! These crazy coots keep walking right in front of the door, getting in the way. The old coots aren’t even going anywhere, they just keep looping around to obstruct the way!
* Darn coots! Forget the yield flag, it’s time to exit. Imagine busting out of the exit, punching and pushing your way through the old coots. Hear them scream and shout “Augh! My hip!” as you plow through them.
