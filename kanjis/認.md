## Mnemonics
 * What people <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> to you will be carved by a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> blade</span> into your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span>, and the next time you see them, you'll immediately <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> recognize</span> them.
* Sometimes your brain won't recognize someone, but your heart will. That's because what they say draws that blade across your heart and leaves a mark, for better or for worse, forever.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> recognize</span> places, names, and even games this way. But the thing that has the most real estate on your heart, the thing you recognize the most, is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Nin</span>tendo (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にん](https://jisho.org/search/にん)</span>).
* There's just something about Nintendo—you'd recognize them and their games anywhere.
