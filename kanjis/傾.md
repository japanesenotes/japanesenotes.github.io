## Mnemonics
 * You <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> change</span> this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> geoduck</span> because you want it to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lean</span>. Right now it's standing up straight, but you want it to lean to one side instead. 
* Why do you want this geoduck to lean? Try to come up with your own reason. And why don't you look up what a geoduck looks like one more time for good measure. You don't want to be able to get this image out of your head.
* To get the geoduck to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lean</span> you put a piece of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>ke (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けい](https://jisho.org/search/けい)</span>) on one of its sides.
* Watch as the geoduck slowly leans toward the cake, trying to get at it for a taste. But don't let it eat any! Keep putting the cake further and further away so the geoduck has to lean more.
