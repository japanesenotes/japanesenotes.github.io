## Mnemonics
 * You're trying to use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> to cause a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> landslide</span> so you have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shake</span> the earth. You probably won't succeed, but the best you can do is to shake your hands on the dirt as hard as you can. It looks like you're trying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wave</span> at the ground now.
* Imagine shaking your fingers at the dirt. Do you think you can shake the dirt hard enough to cause a landslide (spoilers, no).
* You think you finally got the earth to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shake</span> but when you look down it's just your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shin</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しん](https://jisho.org/search/しん)</span>). Darn you shins, I thought I made some progress. Hey wait... why won't you stop?!
* Imagine your shins shaking, your hands are waving, and they won't stop. No! You shouldn't have tried to start a landslide. This was a bad idea!
