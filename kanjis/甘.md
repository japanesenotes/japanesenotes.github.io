## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sweet</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sweet</span> kanji are exactly the same! Double sweet.
* 
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sweet</span>, sweet sensation is almost overwhelming. You gotta put on some sweet resistant <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> armor</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あま](https://jisho.org/search/あま)</span>) to protect you from all that sweetness. The armor will prevent you from having a sweet, sweet sweetness overload.
* Put on the armor! Feel its weight on your body. Now taste the sweet flavor on your tongue. It’s sweet, but not too sweet.
