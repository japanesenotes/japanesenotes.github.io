## Mnemonics
 * If you give <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Splinter</span> your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span> you'll feel pretty <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foolish</span> afterwards. His heart belongs to the art of ninjutsu! 
* You were foolish to give your heart away to Splinter. He didn't want it. Also he's a rat, what's wrong with you?
* Splinter tells you to your face how <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foolish</span> you are and you feel your heart turn to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> goo</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぐ](https://jisho.org/search/ぐ)</span>). Now you can't even give it to someone else. No one wants goo.
* What will you do with your foolish goo heart now?
