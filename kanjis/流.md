## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> lifts all the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> trash</span> out of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> river</span> and it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stream</span>s out onto the shores.
* As the tsunami recedes, watch as all of the trash comes streaming out of the river and crowds the bank.
* Next to the trash <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stream</span> you suddenly see <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ryu</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りゅう](https://jisho.org/search/りゅう)</span>) from Street Fighter and he looks pissed. He's furious that so many people throw their trash in the river and it causes streams like this.
* Now Ryu is punching and kicking and tatsumaki senpukyaku-ing all of the trash into burnable and non-burnable piles. But the stream doesn't end. Now he's trying to get his other Street Fighter pals to help him beat it back!
