## Mnemonics
 * You take your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Korea</span> and everything is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> different</span>!
* Imagine scooting down a street in Korea and seeing how different literally every single thing is compared to what you're used to in Japan.
* What's also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> different</span> is that there's a weird tiger bouncing on its tail alongside you yelling that its name is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Tigger</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちが](https://jisho.org/search/ちが)</span>). You didn't know Tigger was living in Korea these days. That's definitely different.
* Tigger is different in Korea too. For one, he's a white tiger now, and he's, like, really aggressive. Wait, was he always like that?
