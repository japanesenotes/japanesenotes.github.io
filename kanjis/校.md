## Mnemonics
 * Next to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span>, a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lid</span> is put on your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> father</span>. Hello child, he says. This is your new <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> school</span>. 
* He goes on to explain that he changed your school to here because there is a tree to block the satellite's view. Also, he wears a tin foil lid on his head so they can't track him. The regular school was no good because they were watching. So now you have this new school, taught under a tree by your father who's wearing a lid on his head.
* Your new <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> school</span> has other students too. They are all <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>s, though.
* On your first day of school, imagine walking under the tree and seeing all your classmates. They're all <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span>–similar to each other, but with some variation. Your father explains these <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span>s escaped from a government research facility, and they come to this school to receive a better education.  These poor <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span>s need a school that will teach them more than just kanji and Japanese vocabulary.
