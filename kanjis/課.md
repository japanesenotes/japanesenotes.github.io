## Mnemonics
 * I always <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fruit</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> section</span> at the grocery should be at the front of the store. It’s the perfect place for the fruit section, I say.
* Think about it. Every grocery store has the fruit section right at the front, wouldn’t you say?
* To get to the fruit <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> section</span>, you have to go to the store. To get to the store you have to drive a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>). Driving a car is the fastest way to get to the fruit section at the store.
* Picture yourself driving a car and salivating over the fruit waiting for you in the fruit section. Imagine your favorite fruit as you put the pedal to the metal in your awesome car.
