## Mnemonics
 * If you set a fish on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> and chop its <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fins</span> off with an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> axe</span>, you’re probably a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soldier</span>. Only soldiers have access to axes, and you like to eat fish, but first you have to set it on the ground to chop its fins off.
* Imagine trying to carve a fish with an axe. Probably not an easy thing to do. If you’re a trained axe soldier, you’d probably have an easier time with it. Picture yourself chopping off fins as an expert axe soldier.
* Uh-oh, it looks like this axe <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soldier</span> was so excited about chopping the fins off his fish that he didn't think about how he was going to cook them. The only thing nearby to light on fire is a bale of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hay</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [へい](https://jisho.org/search/へい)</span>). Well, it's not the best thing, but at least it will get these fish cooked.
* Imagine this soldier lighting a bale of hay on fire to cook his fish. The hay burns really fast, but it should be enough.
