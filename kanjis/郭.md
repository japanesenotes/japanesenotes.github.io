 * Put a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sock</span> in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span> and it turns into an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> enclosure</span>.
* Why? Because that sock is now enclosed in that building!
* Now that you have an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> enclosure</span>, let's go deeper. Put a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かく](https://jisho.org/search/かく)</span>) in the sock and it becomes an enclosure inside an enclosure.
* Picture this inception enclosure mess in your mind and you'll never forget this kanji, I promise.
