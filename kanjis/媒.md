## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sweet</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> woman</span> sits under a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> and works as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mediator</span>. If you're having a fight with someone, bring them to the sweet woman under the tree and she'll mediate for the two of you. Problem solved! Thanks sweet lady!
* Imagine the sweet tree woman being a mediator for you and your arch rival. What she says fixes everything between you two!
* You go to pay the woman for being your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mediator</span> for you two but she just says, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Bye</span> <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばい](https://jisho.org/search/ばい)</span>). You try to hand her some money and she stares into your eyes. Bye. Oh... okay, bye then.
* Imagine her refusing to let you pay her for her mediator services and just saying bye over and over until you leave. Weird.
