* Imagine the leader looking around the rice paddy. He keeps saying, Ugh, it would be convenient if I didn't have to walk around out here looking for the treasure that's going to make things more convenient for me. Ugh. Go ahead and say this phrase out loud, too, pretending to be the leader in the rice paddy. Feel the cold and the wet, making it less convenient for you.

Finally, the treasure of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> convenience</span> that will make this leader's life so much easier. He digs into the ground and pulls out a box.
