## Mnemonics
 * If you only let <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> oneself</span> (yourself) into your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span>, you'll end up <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mourning</span> all of the loves and friendships you could have had but didn't let in.
* Picture yourself all alone. You never let anyone into your heart but yourself, and now you're mourning the life and friends you could have had.
* While you're in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mourning</span>, you feel a sharp pain in your crying eyes. A <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> key</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [き](https://jisho.org/search/き)</span>) comes sliding out with your tears. You look around wildly, but you're still alone. Is this... the key of mourning?
* You try to push the key back into your body. Back into your eye, you even try to swallow it, but it comes back out. Finally you look down at your mourning heart and try the key there. It clicks. And opens.
