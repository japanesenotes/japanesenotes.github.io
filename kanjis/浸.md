## Mnemonics
 * In the event of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span>, <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Wolverine</span>, your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> forehead</span>, and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span> will all be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> immersed</span> in it. You will become immersed in the tsunami after it hits because tsunamis are gigantic and bring a lot of water. Now you and your forehead are immersed in the tsunami along with Wolverine and a stool.
* Feel the water all around you as you become immersed in this tsunami. See Wolverine trying to swim his way to the top as you watch the stool floating about in the water.
* Still <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> immersed</span>, the stool floats over and hits you in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shin</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しん](https://jisho.org/search/しん)</span>). The tsunami gave the stool a good push and while it was fully immersed, it ran into your shin. It really hurts.
* Hear the stool crack against your shin and feel the pain erupt through your leg. You try to scream but you’re under water so you just get a big mouthful of tsunami.
