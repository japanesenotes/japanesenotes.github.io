## Mnemonics
 * <div><div>You SAY you want PEACE. But this is just because you have EVALUATED the situation and believe it is the only way for you to survive. If you thought you could kill me, then you would have wanted war.<br><br>You should <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> peace</span> before you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> evaluate</span> a situation. That way everyone will know where you’re coming from. If you’re honest and say your peace before you evaluate a situation out loud, everyone will know where you stand.</div></div>
* What situation would you like to evaluate? Be sure to say your peace before doing so. Imagine yourself doing this out loud and think of what you would say.
* While you say your peace, you end up making a really bad pun and you hear somebody say “<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Heyo</span>!” (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひょう](https://jisho.org/search/ひょう)</span>) You look at the people around you and try to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> evaluate</span> who said heyo, but you can’t tell. You start talking again when somebody exclaims “That’s what she said” and another person shouts “Heyo!” once again, but you still can’t evaluate who’s saying these things.
* Imagine yourself trying to explain a situation you’re about to evaluate and your audience keeps shouting “Heyo!” every other sentence. Imagine how frustrating that would be. Get angry at your rude audience and how much they shout “Heyo.”
