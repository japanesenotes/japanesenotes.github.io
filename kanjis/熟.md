## Mnemonics
 * You lay your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sock</span> in a little <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> circle</span> and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> boil</span> it so it will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ripen</span>.
* You don't want to clean the sock, you want all of those nasty foot and shoe juices to ripen into the sock. It's like how the longer you let an apple ripen, the worse it smells and tastes, after a while.
* You take your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ripen</span>ed sock, and throw it at your worst enemy! But they <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> juke</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゅく](https://jisho.org/search/じゅく)</span>) out of the way, and throw a ripened pair of socks at you! You manage to juke too, but they're already preparing what looks like some very ripe underpants.
* Ahhh! Juke for your life, or you'll end up smelling like some ripened stuff I can't even mention!!
