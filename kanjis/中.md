## Mnemonics
 * The radical <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Middle</span> and the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Middle</span> are both the same. So if you know one, you know the other.
* Make sure you're studying your radicals, otherwise you might find yourself in the middle of a kanji-learning problem.
* To remember the reading for this kanji, we use the word <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chew</span>bacca to pull up <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちゅう](https://jisho.org/search/ちゅう)</span> in our memory. <br />If you remember back to the radical <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [中](https://jisho.org/search/中)</span>, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> middle</span> of your mouth was stabbed with a stick. You look up to see who did it. There stands <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chew</span>bacca, doing his Chewbacca yell. And it isn't a stick in your mouth, it's an arrow from his crossbow (a bowcaster, actually). It just so happens Chewbacca's bowcaster looks just like this kanji too. Go figure.
* Imagine the fear and shock you'd feel after finding out it was Chewbacca who shot the middle of your mouth (and head). Touch his fur. Look really close at his weapon. Give him a sniff, too. Just so that memory never fades away.
