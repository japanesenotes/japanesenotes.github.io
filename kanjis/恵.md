## Mnemonics
 * You carry a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> across a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span> on it to return a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> favor</span> for your friend. The heart needs to be purified so that’s why you have it on the cross and your friend lives on a rice paddy farm so that’s why you’re running through that. The favor you are paying your friend back with is getting him this heart. He needs a new one and you’re providing it.
* This is a pretty big favor. Imagine running through a rice paddy carrying a cross with a warm beating heart on it. Thump thump. Thump thump.
* You arrive at your friend’s place and you can finally return the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> favor</span> you owe him by presenting him with the heart. “<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Eh</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [え](https://jisho.org/search/え)</span>)? What’s this? I didn’t ask for this!” “Eh!?!?” you reply. Apparently he didn’t want a real heart, he wanted a candy one. He wanted a Valentine!
* Imagine how dumb you feel at this miscommunication. Eh? You don’t feel dumb? Well you should!
