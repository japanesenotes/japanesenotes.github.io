## Mnemonics
 * You have <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fins</span> in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> private</span>. But, you want the world to see them, so you take them <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> public</span>.
* Picture yourself in private, with fins. You wish others could see them. That's it, you decide. It's time to show the world. I'm going to make my fins public!
* You head out into the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> public</span> where everyone can see your fins, but... things have changed. All people are the same. There are thousands of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>s walking around, and they all stare at you (though they pretend like they aren't).
* Remember, whenever we see the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)</span>, think of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち</span>, a founder of WaniKani. We'll keep it consistent, so over time you should develop a character around <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち</span> that you learn to love or hate.<br />How long have you been hiding in private with your fins? The public areas have changed, and all the people have become <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち</span>s. One mother <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち</span>--pushing a baby <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち</span>--looks up and stares at your fins. Now you remember why you never go out in public.
