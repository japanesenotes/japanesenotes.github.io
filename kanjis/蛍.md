## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Viking</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> insect</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> firefly</span>. In the insect kingdom, the insect most resembling a Viking is undoubtedly the firefly.
* Imagine this little firefly blinking his firefly light as he flies around shouting a Viking warcry and brandishing an axe. Yaaaargh!
* The Viking <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> firefly</span> is attacking <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Hotaru</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほたる](https://jisho.org/search/ほたる)</span>) Tomoe (alter ego of Sailor Saturn) because the Viking firefly hates the show Sailor Moon and everyone on it. Hotaru screams in terror as she is deathly afraid of fireflies, especially Viking ones.
* Hear Hotaru’s shrill scream as she runs away from the Viking firefly. If you don’t know what Hotaru Tomoe looks like, Google a picture of her to get a better visualization.
