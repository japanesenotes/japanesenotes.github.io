## Mnemonics
 * This is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> anti</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span>. The dirt is becoming not dirt as it goes on, forming a... <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> slope</span>! Really what is the air above a slope but anti dirt?
* This is some high level thinking, but I know you can do it. Picture a slope. Now picture an anti slope (like a negative image). It's all just dirt and anti dirt at the same time! Woah! Mind Freak!
* You need to know these kinds of things about <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> slope</span>s if you want to play <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soccer</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さか](https://jisho.org/search/さか)</span>). Soccer is pretty slope-intensive. You really have to know how to read their dirt and anti dirt to really get good.
* Picture a slope. Now picture yourself playing soccer on the slope. Now picture your anti self playing soccer on the anti slope.
