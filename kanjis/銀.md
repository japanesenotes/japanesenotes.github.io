## Mnemonics
 * At the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> root</span> of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gold</span>, there is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> silver</span>. Gold is basically just silver leveled up. That's why gold is first place, and silver is second. If you just scratch gold really good, you'll find that at its root, there's silver hidden just underneath.
* Imagine taking a gold coin and rubbing it with some soap and water. As you rub, you slowly see that it's really silver underneath. Huh!
* If you want to hunt for some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> silver</span> for yourself, all you need is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gui</span>nea (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎん](https://jisho.org/search/ぎん)</span>) pig. Guinea pigs can smell silver, so get a couple and set them loose in the woods and they'll lead you straight to it.
* Guinea pigs are to silver as normal pigs are to truffles.
