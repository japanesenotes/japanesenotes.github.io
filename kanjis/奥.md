## Mnemonics
 * If there’s a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> on your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> head</span> and the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice</span> is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> big</span>, you know you’re in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> interior</span>. And by interior, I mean you’re actually inside someone. The rice is big because you’ve shrunk to a tiny size and are inside someone’s stomach. The drop on your head is actually digestive fluid.
* Imagine being in the interior of someone’s tummy. See the big pieces of rice all around you as drops of stomach fluid continue to drop down on your head.
* While you’re in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> interior</span> of this guy, you hear him break out in song. He starts singing “<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ok</span>lahoma” (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おく](https://jisho.org/search/おく)</span>) at the top of his lungs. The big pieces of rice slosh around as he sings and dances. “OOOOk-lahoma, where the wind comes sweepin' down the plain!”
* If you’re unfamiliar with this Oklahoma song, check it out on YouTube. Imagine being in the interior of someone’s belly as you hear this song booming all around you.
