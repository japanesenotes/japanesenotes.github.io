## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> district</span> that <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lack</span>s things will be in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Europe</span>.
* Picture a map of Europe in your mind. Now picture little words saying which district is lacking what. This one is lacking water. That one is lacking food.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Europe</span> is lacking so much because their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 王</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おう](https://jisho.org/search/おう)</span>) keeps taking everything.
* Okay, so maybe this is an old view of Europe. But back in the old days the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [王](https://jisho.org/search/王)</span>s there would take everything from their subjects, so every district would lack something. Good thing things aren't that way now, huh?
