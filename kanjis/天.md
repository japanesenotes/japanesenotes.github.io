## Mnemonics
 * The radical <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heaven</span> is the same as the kanji <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> heaven</span>, making this an easy kanji to memorize.
* If you know your radicals well (and you should!) you know the meaning of this kanji well, as well!
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Heaven</span>... nowadays, people aren't all that good. Things have gotten bad. That's why the acceptance rate to get into heaven is only <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ten</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てん](https://jisho.org/search/てん)</span>) percent!
* Imagine yourself in line to get into heaven. You're super worried, because you're not sure if you'll get in. You heard there was a one in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ten</span> chance... those aren't good odds. Feel nervous in your imagination. Feel worried. Feel the pressure as you get closer and closer to the gate... will you make it?? Ten percent!
