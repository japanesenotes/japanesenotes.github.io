## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> life</span> radical is without the slide (as it sometimes is), but when you combine that with the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> you have life during winter. What gives you life during the winter? It's the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wheat</span> you store away.
* Imagine you're starving. It's cold and you've run out of food. You don't know what you're going to do. If you don't find something, you'll lose your life. Then, you break open a barrel, and wheat pours out. It's beautiful. You just found some life in the middle of winter.
* You found your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wheat</span>. Thank God. You'll survive. You have to take the wheat back to your house, though. On your way, you get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mug</span>ged (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [むぎ](https://jisho.org/search/むぎ)</span>).
* Imagine the disappointment. You go from finding life to losing it all... now you have no hope for the winter :( Also, keep in mind that <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [むぎ](https://jisho.org/search/むぎ)</span> and mug aren't super-alike, so you'll have to use it to get  close enough to remember the actual reading, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [むぎ](https://jisho.org/search/むぎ)</span>.
