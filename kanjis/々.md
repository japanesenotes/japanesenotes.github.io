## Mnemonics
 * This is a strange kanji because it doesn't really mean anything at all. In fact, what it does is it repeats the kanji that comes before it. For example: <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [人々](https://jisho.org/search/人々)</span> is actually <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [人人](https://jisho.org/search/人人)</span>. This kanji shows up whenever there's a repeating kanji, because it's often easier to write than writing a more complicated kanji twice. That's why this kanji is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> repeater</span>. It repeats what comes before it.<br />To remember that this kanji is the repeater, though, think of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> of water dripping into a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> prison</span>. Drip drop drip drop. It does that over and over again, driving the prisoners nuts. But it never stops. It just repeats over and over.
* Since this kanji doesn't really have a meaning as much as it does a function, try to change the way you think about it when you're memorizing it.
* In Japanese, this symbol is often called the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [のま](https://jisho.org/search/のま)</span> because it looks like the katakana characters <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ノ](https://jisho.org/search/ノ)</span> and <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [マ](https://jisho.org/search/マ)</span> put together. If you know katakana then this will be easy to read. If you don't, think of it this way: <br />Your mom is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> repeater</span>. She is trying to force feed you over and over again until you explode (literally). You keep yelling <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> No ma</span>! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [のま](https://jisho.org/search/のま)</span>) but she doesn't stop. She's on a repeating track, never stopping, repeating forever.
* If you feel like you're so full you're about to burst, and if you imagine your mom doing this to you (how could you, ma?), you should be able to remember the reading of this kanji. That being said, the reading is mostly only useful in the event that you have to identify a <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [々](https://jisho.org/search/々)</span>—otherwise, you won't see it much.
