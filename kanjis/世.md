## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> world</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> world</span> kanji are the same, but there is another really important meaning you need to know: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> generation</span>. <br />Think of it this way: the world is just made up of many different generations of people, plants, and animals all getting along together.
* It's all these generational differences that make the world go 'round!
* It's your job to protect the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> world</span> and every <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> generation</span> with your special <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sa</span>ber (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せい](https://jisho.org/search/せい)</span>). It was given to you to uphold correctness, and you'll pass it on to the next generation when it's time. Then they'll watch out for the world when you're gone.
* Hold the saber up high and pledge to protect the world for all of the generations to come! Then swish it around and make buzzing sounds with your mouth.
