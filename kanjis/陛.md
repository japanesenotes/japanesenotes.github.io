 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Compare</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span> to some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> and you'll see the difference between you and His and Her <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Highness</span>. You live outside and sleep on the dirt. But His and Her Highness both live in a huge building.
* Picture Her Highness, high up in her building. Now compare her home and life to yours, you dirt person.
* I bet His <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Highness</span> has never had to sleep in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hay</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [へい](https://jisho.org/search/へい)</span>) either, like you do every night. Hay is what you use as a pillow, mattress, blanket. Basically hay and dirt are all you have. Unlike His Highness.
* Picture His and Her Highness coming out of their huge building and walking by you in your hay pile. My goodness, Highness, have you ever seen such a dirty, fluffy creature? My no, dear, let's move quickly to remove it from our sight!
