## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> nothing</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dance</span> is still a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dance</span>!
* If you want to do the nothing dance, just clear your head so there's nothing in it, and then dance!
* To help you do this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dance</span> you need some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boo</span>ze (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぶ](https://jisho.org/search/ぶ)</span>). Just enough so it's easier to think of nothing, let all your fears go, and dance.
* Feel the booze coursing through your veins as you dance like no one is watching.
