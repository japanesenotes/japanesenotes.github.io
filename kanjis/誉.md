## Mnemonics
 * There’s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grass</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> and the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fins</span> there <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> you have no <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> honor</span>. The fins are left over from the fish you dismembered and they do not believe it was an act of honor. Now they are just sitting on the ground on the grass, calling you out for having no honor.
* Listen to what the fins have to say as they flop around on the ground in the grass. Hear them swish about as they flop, brushing up against the blades of grass.
* Being one of little <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> honor</span>, you decide to squash these vocal fins with your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>-yo (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よ](https://jisho.org/search/よ)</span>). You take out your yo-yo and start bashing each fin with it until they stop talking about what little honor you have.
* Imagine taking your yo-yo out to do this. Feel the string tighten around your finger as you unleash the yo-yo and silence all the fins.
