## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> melts into the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> after listening to loud <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> music</span> in the hot <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span>, so you have to find a nice big <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tank</span> to scoop the melted tree into. The music made the tree vibrate at juuust the right frequency that it, combined with the hot sun, made the tree turn into a puddle. You can't just leave it being all blobby on the ground, so you find a tank for it.
* Imagine scooping a melted tree into a tank. It's a very strange sensation.
* You're staring at the big <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tank</span> when an eerie sound comes out, Oooh I am the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>) of the tree! You've trapped me in this tank and now I'm going to haunt it! You don't want to be haunted by a tank with a soul stuck in it.
* Um, okay? you reply to the soul, and walk away from the tank. W-wait! Tanks can't move? Come back, let me haunt you with my tree soul!<br />It's a good thing there weren't wheels on that tank!
