## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horse</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> horse</span> kanji are exactly the same! Huzzah!
* 
* You are looking at a horse. It's looking at you. You try making horse noises at it, to get a reaction. Instead of reacting with a normal horse noise, it just makes sheep noises: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Baaa</span>, (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ば](https://jisho.org/search/ば)</span>) it says. Baaaaa.
* Feel the shock of this. It sounds just like a sheep, it's strange.
