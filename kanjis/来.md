## Mnemonics
 * There's <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice</span> spread out all over the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span>. This will cause the Predator to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> come</span> because he loves kome (rice). Then once he's gone, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> next</span> Predator will come to eat.
* Also imagine everyone else coming to the rice next. When rice spills, people come from all around to line up and grab a handful of it to take home. Who's next? Come forward!
* When they come, though, everyone is disappointed. It turns out it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rye</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [らい](https://jisho.org/search/らい)</span>) grains, and rye grains taste terrible. Yuck.
* If you love rye grains, on the other hand, imagine everyone being really happy that they came to get the rice. They're so lucky it's rye!
