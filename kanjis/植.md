## Mnemonics
 * If you want to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fix</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> you have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> plant</span> it. It's pretty obvious that digging up the tree broke it. So fix it by planting it again. That is how plants work.
* Is your tree broken? Fix it up by planting it somewhere else. Somewhere with the right amount of light and no biting bugs.
* If you don't <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> plant</span> a tree it goes into <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shock</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょく](https://jisho.org/search/しょく)</span>). Which, honestly, shouldn't be very shocking to you, since it's a tree.
* Have you ever seen a tree in shock? Imagine it now. It's shaking and dying and sad. Make sure you properly plant all your trees from now on.
