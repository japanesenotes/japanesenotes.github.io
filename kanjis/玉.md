## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span> has something in his hand that he's <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span>ping... but it bounces too! He's bouncing a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ball</span>
* This kanji looks just like a king bouncing a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ball</span>, no? If not, imagine the kanji itself bouncing the drop (the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ball</span>) over and over again, then laying some hoops like a pro.
* Think of someone curled up in a ball. It is someone you know / someone famous named “Tom” (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たま](https://jisho.org/search/たま)</span>).
* So, who's in a ball? Which Tom did you choose?
