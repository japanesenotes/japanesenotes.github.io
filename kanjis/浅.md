## Mnemonics
 * If you visit a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bar</span> after a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span>, you’ll be hanging out in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shallow</span> water. After a tsunami, you want to relax with a drink at the bar. Unfortunately, tsunamis cause floods, and the bar floor is immersed in shallow water.
* Picture yourself at this bar, sipping on a drink while you’re wading in this shallow water. Feel the shallow water getting your socks and shoes all wet. It’s uncomfortable and cold.
* What beer are you drinking at this bar while standing in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shallow</span> water? You’re drinking <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Asa</span>hi (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あさ](https://jisho.org/search/あさ)</span>), the beer of the salaryman. Asahi is super dry, so it takes your attention away from the shallow water a bit.
* Picture yourself in the bar again sipping on this Asahi beer. Taste the beery beer taste of Asahi as you walk around the bar with your wet feet.
