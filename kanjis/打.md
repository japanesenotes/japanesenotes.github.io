## Mnemonics
 * Take your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> to the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> street</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hit</span> some people! Street fingers are for curling into a fist. And that street fist wants to do some hitting!
* Imagine: it's just you, your fingers, and the wild street. It's hitting time!
* As you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hit</span> one chump after another, suddenly your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> da</span>d (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だ](https://jisho.org/search/だ)</span>) comes marching out of your house. Uh oh. Dad caught you hitting, which, honestly, isn't a very nice thing to do, so he has every right to stop you.
* Now imagine your dad saying, Don't do a hit! over and over at you. I'm sorry dad! But the streets were calling me!
