## Mnemonics
 * If you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stand</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> wind</span> it will be really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> quick</span> to knock you over. So quick that you probably won't even know the wind did it. You'll end up standing up again just to be knocked over again, just as quick.
* Imagine how quick the wind knocks you over when you stand up. So quick, you don't even remember being up. Try again and try to count how many seconds it takes for it to knock you down. Less than one. Now that's quick.
* The wind was so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> quick</span> to knock you down that you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sat</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さつ](https://jisho.org/search/さつ)</span>) down instead. The wind may be quick, but it can't knock you down if you've already sat yourself.
* Picture how quick you sat down. Even faster than the quick wind. Nice job!
