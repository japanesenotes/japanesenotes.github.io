## Mnemonics
 * What might cause a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span> down a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> jet</span> would be if its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stocks</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shares</span> took a dive in the market. This tree was on a jet for an important investor meeting when it got the news that its stocks and shares had just plummeted. Being very upset, the tree got up and got on the emergency slide out of the jet and plummeted into the ground just like his stocks and shares.
* Visualize this tree sliding out of the jet and falling to his doom. As he falls, visualize red lines falling alongside him to represent the stocks and shares. Hear the shrill whistle of them speeding through the air to the ground.
* Once the tree hits the ground with his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stocks</span> and his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shares</span>, the impact creates a large <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> KABOO</span>M (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かぶ](https://jisho.org/search/かぶ)</span>)! Stocks hit the ground - KABOOM! Shares! KABOOM! Tree! KABOOOOOOM~!
* Listen to each of these things impact the ground and see each individual mushroom cloud appear around them. KABOOM! KABOOM! KABOOM!
