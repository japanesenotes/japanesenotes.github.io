## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice</span> radical and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rice</span> are the same in looks as well as in meaning. This also refers to America, maybe because America is covered in rice or fields or something?
* Aren't radicals nice? They make things so much easier... if you've been studying them.
* You've got tons of dry grains of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rice</span>. You have no idea what you're going to do with it. Then, you come up with a solution. All this dry rice could go towards filling up the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bay</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [べい](https://jisho.org/search/べい)</span>), so you have more land to farm on!
* In your mind, bulldoze the rice into the bay, watching it fill it up, then pile high. It's not particularly good looking land, but it'll do, and it's already full of seeds, so that's pretty good. The important thing is that you think you have way too much of the stuff, so the only way to get rid of it is to dump it in a large body of water, and that large body of water is a bay.
