## Mnemonics
 * If you put <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> two</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> two</span> pound weights on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> person</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> they'll increase in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stature</span> when they come back down. Everything is lighter on the moon so the person won't even feel the weights. Then when they come back to earth they'll have grown a whole two inches taller!
* Imagine how much height you'd gain if you spent time lifting weights on the moon!
* Getting a taller <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stature</span> will also make you seem super <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sexy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せき](https://jisho.org/search/せき)</span>) on the moon and back home on earth. If you stay on the moon long enough, you'll be the tallest person in the galaxy and who wouldn't find that sexy?! Huh?
* Imagine how sexy the height of a ten foot tall person would be after just coming back from weight training on the moon.
