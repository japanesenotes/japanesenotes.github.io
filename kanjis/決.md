## Mnemonics
 * You have at your disposal a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hook</span> to assassinate this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> person</span>. Which weapon will you choose. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Decide</span> now!
* Have trouble with the decision. Which one? Tsunami will be big and cool, but a hook will be more discreet. How can you decide? Can you think of a neat way to decide this, like Two-Face on Batman?
* To remember the reading <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けつ](https://jisho.org/search/けつ)</span> we always use the word ketsup. It's a special mix of ketchup and catsup (yum!)<br />You finally <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> decide</span>. You're going to go with the tsunami... but not just any tsunami. You'll kill him with a tsunami of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ketsu</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けつ](https://jisho.org/search/けつ)</span>).
* Get everything ready to take your target down. How will you plan this? Where will you put it? Go ahead and watch your plan unfurl, too.
