## Mnemonics
 * If there is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> crab trap</span>, it's a lot for the crabs to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> endure</span>. Lots of crabs can't endure this and die before they're hauled out of the sea. The ones that are living are going to die once they're out anyway, so all they can do is try to endure what's about to happen as best they can.
* Imagine being a little crab, getting stuck in a crab trap with dirt and other crabs. Endure the horror as long as you can, little friend.
* The little crab who <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> endure</span>s being stuck in a dirty crab trap just ends up being turned into a seafood <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ta</span>co (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [た](https://jisho.org/search/た)</span>). It held out as long as it could, but then it was chopped up and turned into taco filling.
* The next time you eat a crab taco, think about what the crab had to endure for you to get your meal. I hope you're happy with yourself!
