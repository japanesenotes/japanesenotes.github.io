## Mnemonics
 * If you're <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> anti</span>-<span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eat</span> your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> meal</span> will just sit in front of you, uneaten. Food is meant to be eaten! Stop trying to fast and take a bite.
* Look down at the huge meal in front of you. I guess there are plenty of reasons to be anti-eat right now, but you'll have to eat your food eventually.
* As you stare at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> meal</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Han</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はん](https://jisho.org/search/はん)</span>) Solo appears before you and takes a bite! This is what happens if you don't eat your food, someone else will eat it.
* Picture Han Solo slowly eating your whole meal! He's making constant eye contact with you, reaching down and shoving the entire meal into his mouth.
