## Mnemonics
 * You take <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> down a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span> to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drunkard</span> that you picked from your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> luxuriant</span> garden. You picked the flowers from the luxuriant garden, not the drunkard, mind you. Also the drunkard has a cane, but not flowers. That’s why you picked some from your luxuriant garden and slid down your cool slide. Now the drunkard has a cane and some flowers.
* Imagine picking these flowers from your luxuriant garden then shooting down the slide. There are so many flowers that you are simply overwhelmed by their aroma. Now hand your flowers to the drunkard and watch his face light up as he excitedly thanks you for the gift.
* The drunkard is so happy to receive flowers from your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> luxuriant</span> garden that he begins to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mo</span>an (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [も](https://jisho.org/search/も)</span>) with pleasure. The moans are getting louder and more erotic. You’re kind of creeped out. You really want him to stop moaning.
* Hear the drunkard moan as he rubs the flowers all over his body. You’re really weirded out. This is the last time you give him flowers from your luxuriant garden, that’s for sure.
