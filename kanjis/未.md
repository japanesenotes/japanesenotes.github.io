## Mnemonics
 * You're flying in a Jet. Even though it's one of the fastest things on earth, your child is sitting in the back asking, Are we there yet? Are we there yet? You have to keep responding. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Not yet</span>! Not yet! NOT YET!
* Feel the irritation of this. How irritating is this kid going to be the whole flight over? The jet is going as fast as it can!
* What a selfish kid, right? Well, all he thinks about is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Me</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [み](https://jisho.org/search/み)</span>) me me me me me me me me me me. Hate kids like that.
* Go ahead and pretend to listen to the kid asking if we're there yet. Then in your mind go me me me me me me me quietly.
