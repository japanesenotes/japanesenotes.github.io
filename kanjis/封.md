## Mnemonics
 * You need to make a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> measurement</span> of an area so you take two clumps of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seal in</span> each side of your measuring tape, so it stays on the ground. This is the way people used to seal things back in the day, back when we didn't have fancy things like tape and glue.
* Picture sealing other things with dirt. Like the bricks in your wall. Or the hole in your floor. Dirt can seal in anything.
* You can also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seal</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foo</span>d (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふう](https://jisho.org/search/ふう)</span>) in dirt to make it last longer. That's how jerky came about, you know. Seal some meat underground and in a few months you'll have some tasty dried meats to chew.<br />By the way, this has another reading you should probably know. It’s <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほう](https://jisho.org/search/ほう)</span>. Most sealing is done in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ho</span>me (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほう](https://jisho.org/search/ほう)</span>), you know? So just think about eating food in your own home!
* Dig up your sealed food and eat it in the comfort of your own home. Mm, delicious!
