## Mnemonics
 * Mix <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spider</span>s into <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> alcohol</span> to make <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> acid</span>. Spiders have a little bit in them already, but if you really want to make it potent, smash them in some whiskey to make a deadly acid that will rip through anything.
* Imagine crushing up some spiders into alcohol. Watch it turn green. It's going to eat through the beaker! Quick, do something!
* You're trying to find a container for this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> acid</span> when <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> San</span>ta-san (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さん](https://jisho.org/search/さん)</span>) bursts through your wall. He frowns down at you. You're on the naughty list now. You killed spiders AND made dangerous acid? Ooooh you're in trouble.
* It’s Christmas morning. Instead of gifts, Santa-san just throws a piece of charcoal at your face. Feel the charcoal smash into your face and explode into acid, burning you. Santa-san runs away laughing. Ho ho ho!
