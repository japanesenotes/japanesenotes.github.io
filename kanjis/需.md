## Mnemonics
 * In the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rain</span> I take my <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rake</span> and shake it, making a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> demand</span> that the rain stop! I demand this rain stop right now! Don’t make me shake my rake more violently than I am currently shaking it!
* Go out into the rain and shake your rake. Imagine shouting your demand at the sky as the rain pelts you from above.
* Now imagine the rain changing. Wait a second, this isn't rain, it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ju</span>ice (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゅ](https://jisho.org/search/じゅ)</span>)! You shake your rake harder, and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> demand</span> that the juice rain continues. It doesn't listen to your demands and stops as soon as you start bottling it. Well, at least you have enough for one, really small juice box. 
* Picture yourself demanding more rain from the sky, trying to fill up your tiny juice box with what little juice rain you were able to get.
