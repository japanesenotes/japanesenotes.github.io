## Mnemonics
 * There's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> tying <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> wolverine</span> to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> pig</span>, balancing them over the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> edge</span> of a cliff together.
* Picture wolverine and a pig hanging precariously over the edge. One move the wrong way and they'll both go toppling over.
* Suddenly, the pig squeals, pulls the thread, and sends them both over the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> edge</span>. Straight to their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> en</span>d (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [えん](https://jisho.org/search/えん)</span>).
* If you fall off the edge it'll be your end too. Always be safe and never get too close to any edges!
