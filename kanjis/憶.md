## Mnemonics
 * When your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> soul</span> has an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> idea</span> it's just a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> recollection</span> of something you already know. Only your brain can have original ideas, so when your soul tries to come up with one, it's just a recollection of something you thought before now.
* When you have a recollection of some idea or thing in the past, it's just your soul saying, hey remember this? Let's not forget this.
* Your soul is sending you a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> recollection</span> right now of... your past life as a farmer in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ok</span>lahoma (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おく](https://jisho.org/search/おく)</span>). You see yourself farming and sweating and living a wonderful life. Hmm, maybe you should move to Oklahoma and live the simple life again.
* Imagine recollecting a past life in Oklahoma. Life was simple and nice. You should consider taking this as a sign to move there again!
