 * You take a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> and try to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> boil</span> it but you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> char</span> it instead. That's what happens when you throw meat into a pot on high with no water in there.
* You should know better than to try to boil something without water! Now what are you going to do with this raw, but charred turkey?!
* You're staring sadly at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> char</span>red turkey when you suddenly sense the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>) looming behind you. You were supposed to be cooking this turkey for him and now he looks really, really mad.
* The Shougun reaches down and bites a charred hunk off the turkey. He yells and spits it out. Why did he do that?! You have no idea but it looked nasty.
