## Mnemonics
 * An <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> animal</span> with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span> is drinking our <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> alcohol</span>? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Still</span>?
* You keep checking outside to see if they have stopped, but they are still drinking. They haven't stopped yet.
* The animal with horns that is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> still</span> drinking your alcohol is no animal at all. It is actually one of the local <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> you</span>ths (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ゆう](https://jisho.org/search/ゆう)</span>) dressed up like a horned animal so they can drink as long as they want and you'll be too scared to shoo them away.
* You keep checking, but that youth is still drinking. Of course, you don't know they are a youth, so it's quite impressive an animal can drink this much.
