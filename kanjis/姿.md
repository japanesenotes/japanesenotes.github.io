## Mnemonics
 * “Bring in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> next</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> woman</span> so that I may examine her <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> figure</span>!” We’re holding auditions for a commercial and we need to find a woman with a nice figure. The last woman was no good, so bring in the next one.
* Imagine yourself as a figure judge on this panel. You need to find a woman with the perfect figure to cast in your commercial. You'd cast yourself, but you just aren't confident (Ridiculous! You're special, and beautiful, and no matter who you are [yes you reading this right now] you should be proud of who you are!).
* The next woman comes in and you examine her <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> figure</span>. The figure you've been searching for! It just happens to belong to a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shee</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [し](https://jisho.org/search/し)</span>) woman. But she's soft, fluffy, and round. The perfect figure!
* We should all try harder to have a figure like this stunning sheep woman!
