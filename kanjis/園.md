## Mnemonics
 * You examine the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> zombie</span> and find a small <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> garden</span> in there. There are even benches... it looks like a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> park</span>.
* Zombies are dead, so I guess their mouths have all the things garden plants crave. Their mouths are like compost piles, if you think about it.
* You look closer at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> garden</span> and suddenly everything <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> en</span>ds (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [えん](https://jisho.org/search/えん)</span>).
* Oh. The zombie probably bit down on your head and now it's the end for you. At least you were looking at a nice garden at the end of it all...
