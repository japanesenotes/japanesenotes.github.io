## Mnemonics
 * There's an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ear</span> just sitting on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span>. Nobody's watching, so, you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> take</span> it.
* Feel the rush of stealing something (even though it's a weird something, admittedly). Start walking away quickly. You don't want to get caught!
* To make sure you get away after taking something that doesn't belong to you, you jump into a laundry <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chute</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅ](https://jisho.org/search/しゅ)</span>)! You saw other criminals take things and jump down chutes, so you decide to do it too.
* Feel the ear you took in your hands as you fly down the chute, the wind whipping past your own ears as you slide to freedom!
