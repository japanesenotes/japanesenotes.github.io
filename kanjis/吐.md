## Mnemonics
 * If you put <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> you're going to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> throw up</span>. That's just a fact.
* That's pretty much what throwing up feels like too, right? Like a bunch of dirt coming out of your mouth. Barf.
* When you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> throw up</span> it sounds like you're shouting, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> HA</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [は](https://jisho.org/search/は)</span>)! Then all the dirt-puke comes out in a wave. It's less of a laugh ha and more of an oh no I'm throwing up ha.
* Imagine the sound you made the last time you threw up. It sounded like you were saying HA from the bottom of your tummy.
