## Mnemonics
 * When a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horse</span> sees a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spider</span> it will start running at a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> speed</span> no one ever thought a horse could go! Horses are super afraid of spiders, you see, so if they see one, they'll bolt and reach top speed! That's actually the only way to get a horse to run that fast. 
* Imagine the eyes of a horse seeing a spider and then running at top speed to get the heck away from it.
* Once people realize that they can increase the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> speed</span> of their horses, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soon</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅん](https://jisho.org/search/しゅん)</span>) everyone will be taking spiders with them to scare their horses into running faster. I say soon because it hasn't quite caught on yet. But if you help to spread the word it can happen even sooner.
* Soon the world will be filled with horses running at full speed all thanks to the spider increase of the 2000s! Soon we will be in the future of top speeds!
