## Mnemonics
 * Tying a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> to a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tombstone</span> each year will help you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> manage</span> the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> passage of time</span>. That way you’ll know how many years it has been, since you’ll have one thread for each year to count.
* Picture yourself coming back to the same tombstone each passing year and tying a new thread to it. You're trying to manage these feelings by keeping track of how much time passes.
* Dealing with the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> passage of time</span> can be tough, so after you tie the thread to the tombstone, each year you eat a piece of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>ke (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けい](https://jisho.org/search/けい)</span>). You already eat cake to mark the passage of time on your birthday, so why not here as well?
* Maybe this is your future tombstone, and eating cake each year is a preemptive celebration of your death day! Ooh, what a spooky theory.
