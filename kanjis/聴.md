## Mnemonics
 * When your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ear</span> is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span>ed with sound, it catches it like a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> net</span>, and sends it to your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span> for processing. Because you're using your heart to process this sound, it means you're giving it a proper <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> listen</span>.
* Imagine the whole process of sound going through your ear and to your heart, then the gears turning to really understand what someone is saying. It's a real listen, not a fake non-heart listen.
* You are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> listen</span>ing so well to what someone is saying. What are they telling you that is so important? They are telling you of the omen of Mrs. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Chou</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちょう](https://jisho.org/search/ちょう)</span>), who will destroy the earth.
* Focus on listening, and focus on their message about Mrs. Chou. Feel afraid about the future because of it.
