## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Simultaneous</span>ly, you throw your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span> at another person who's throwing a knife at you and you both get a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dose</span> of your own medicine. Literally, there's poison on these knives and now you've both been stabbed.
* Watch as the dose of poison sinks into your body through the knife that's in your chest, as it simultaneously happens to the other guy too.
* I need a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dose</span> of the antidote! you yell, and the other guy looks you dead in the eyes. They slowly pull a tiny <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> xy</span>lophone (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ざい](https://jisho.org/search/ざい)</span>) out of their pocket, play a few notes, and then eat it. Ah, you'd like a dose of the xylophone cure, wouldn't you?
* Now you're begging them for a dose of the xylophone drug. Just a taste, you want to live!
