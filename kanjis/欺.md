## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> crab</span> will try to hide what it <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lack</span>s with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deceit</span>. Lying, stealing, faking things—no type of deceit is too much for a crab.
* Covering things up with deceit is pretty much the worst thing you can do, so don't be like this crab.
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Deceit</span> can only take you so far, and soon the crab is caught, tried for its crimes and coverups, and sentenced to death via <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gui</span>llotine (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎ](https://jisho.org/search/ぎ)</span>).
* Picture the crab with its head, er, front half? Whatever, it's in the guillotine and it's screaming, You've been deceived! I never deceived anyone, you're all sheep!
