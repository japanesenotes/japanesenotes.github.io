## Mnemonics
 * World LEADERS have direct LINE CONNECTION to communicate with each other.<br><br>A psychic <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> can pick a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> up off the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> and make a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> connection</span> with the person that it came from. This leader is very powerful, so even a thread is enough for them to make a psychic connection with the person who was wearing the thread.
* Imagine you are this leader and you just picked up this piece of thread from the ground. You get a jarring psychic connection with the owner of the thread. Your head spins, your heart races, and your hands tremble. Picture this happening to you as you pick up the thread from the ground.
* As you develop this psychic <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> connection</span> with the owner of the thread, you can tell that he is currently eating a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>ke (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けい](https://jisho.org/search/けい)</span>). Since the connection is so strong, you feel like you are eating the cake as well. It’s vanilla strawberry.
* Because the connection is so strong, you feel like you too are eating the cake. You taste the fluffy and creamy vanilla strawberry flavors washing over your tongue. Imagine yourself eating this delectable cake. It’s fantastically delicious.
