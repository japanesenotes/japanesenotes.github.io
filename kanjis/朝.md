## Mnemonics
 * There's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> on both sides of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span>, with the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> off to one side. That's because the religious folk are all about the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> morning</span> (all those early church sessions!), and everyone else is all about the night (the moon).
* Just think about religious people waking up super early to do their rituals. That's why the crosses are on the sun. That's why they're associated with the morning.
* But, they're kind of grumpy because they have to wake up early in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> morning</span>. So, they're constantly cutting each other off, pushing each other, and being jerks. Imagine all of these people yelling back and forth at each other: You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ass</span>! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [あさ](https://jisho.org/search/あさ)</span>) a ridiculous amount, then all suddenly becoming quiet when they sit down in the church.
* It might help if you think about them all being Italian too. At least when it comes to a stereotypical Italian accent, they'd say something like you ass-a hole-a! If you're Italian, this is probably absolutely how you don't sound.
