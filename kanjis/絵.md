## Mnemonics
 * Using just <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> meeting</span> the paper (with a little ink on the end) you create a masterpiece of a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> drawing</span> (or a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> painting</span>).
* It's unbelievable the kind of drawing you're able to draw with just the tip of a thread. So much detail. So artistic. If it helps, imagine that you drew the Mona Lisa, better than the original, only using this floppy thread tool.
* You tell someone that you drew this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> drawing</span> only using a thread. Their response? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> EH</span>?!?!? (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [え](https://jisho.org/search/え)</span>)
* Tell a few more people how you drew this. Have them all do the same Eh!!?? reaction.
