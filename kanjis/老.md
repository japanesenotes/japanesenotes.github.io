## Mnemonics
 * By the time you finish digging a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> coffin</span> hole with nothing but a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spoon</span>, you’ll be an old <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> elderly</span> person. Digging with nothing but a spoon takes a long time, especially when the hole needs to be big enough for a coffin. You might as well be digging it for yourself at this rate. By the time you finish, you’ll be all wrinkled and elderly and just about ready to keel over.
* Imagine yourself digging a coffin hole with nothing but a spoon. Your hands get all cramped, your wrist starts to hurt, and you get painful blisters on your hands. It takes forever to dig a hole big enough for a coffin!
* Now that you’re <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> elderly</span> (and probably about to die) you suddenly crave some delicious <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> roe</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ろう](https://jisho.org/search/ろう)</span>). Salmon roe, sea urchin roe, tofugu roe, doesn’t matter. Your old, tired bones need roe after all that hard work!
* You hated roe when you were still young, but now that you’re an elderly old fart you really want to eat it. Roe is for old people, you guess, as you slurp it up.
