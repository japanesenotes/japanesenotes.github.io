## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> splits in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> two</span> when the year comes to an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> end</span>. One half symbolizes the year you were just in, and the other symbolizes the new year beginning, cutting winter in half and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> finish</span>ing off the year.
* Picture the threads that symbolize winter splitting in two to mark the end of the year. Winter isn't finished though, it's only half done.
* Right as winter <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> end</span>s you grab the two threads and lace them into your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shoe</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅう](https://jisho.org/search/しゅう)</span>). Oh, you thought these were metaphorical? No they're real threads, although, they're technically shoe laces now.
* It's the end of the year, so it's time for new shoe laces!
