## Mnemonics
 * This <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> construction</span> project made from <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> will act as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tribute</span> to the Crabigator.
* The Crabigator is a sea creature (maybe?), so making a tribute from shellfish makes some sense.
* This great <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tribute</span> is being commissioned by Emperor <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>. 
* In his power, <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち]([こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)いち)</span> has made a new religion around the Crabigator, to put the fear of kanji learning into his subjects.<br />Hint: When you see <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [工](https://jisho.org/search/工)</span> in a kanji it will often take the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こう](https://jisho.org/search/こう)</span> reading.
