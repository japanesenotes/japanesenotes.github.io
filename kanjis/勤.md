## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Boot</span>s give you the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> power</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> work</span>! That's why so many professions require you to have work boots.
* Imagine putting your boots on and suddenly being filled with the power and energy to work hard and efficiently.
* You need boots to give you the power to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> work</span> for the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Kin</span>g (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きん](https://jisho.org/search/きん)</span>) of England. Really, all work is for the King, since everything is for him. But even he wears boots. And they give him the power to uh... king over things.
* Picture yourself in work boots. Now picture the King in work boots. Yours are worn and beaten up and his are clean and look brand new. But at least you both have them, which means you both work at least a little!
