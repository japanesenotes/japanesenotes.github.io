## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> knocks a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cleat</span> off a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> child</span> and the shoe begins to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> float</span> away in the water. This child was just out playing soccer, minding his own business, when the tsunami crashed in and knocked his cleats off his feet. Now the cleat is floating away with the tsunami.
* Your cleat is floating away but you’re floating too. The water is really deep now, but you try and float towards your cleat to retrieve it. Imagine floating in this wet water reaching for your lost cleat.
* While you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> float</span> in the water, an <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> u</span>ni (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)</span>) jabs into your foot. “<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Uwa</span>aa~ (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)わ</span>)” you cry. That uni really hurts. They’re all spikey and painful and junk. “Uwaaaa~”
* Say “Uwaaa~” out loud a few times while you imagine an <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [う](https://jisho.org/search/う)に</span> stabbing you as you float along with the tsunami water. What a day you’ve had.
