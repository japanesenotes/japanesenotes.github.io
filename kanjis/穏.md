## Mnemonics
 * Some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grains</span> get stuck in his <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cleat</span>, and <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Wolverine</span>'s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span> grows <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> calm</span>. Wolverine had been screaming and yelling and stomping around, but when the grains entered his cleat he realized where he was. He was is finally able to calm down.
* He's calm now because he stomped right into a farmer's field (thus the rice) and if he didn't calm down he'd probably ruin it.
* Now that Wolverine is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> calm</span>, tears come to his eyes. Being calm has given him perspective on what his anger has done. Oh, wait no. There are just some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> on</span>ions (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [おん](https://jisho.org/search/おん)</span>) in his cleats too, and they're making calm tears trickle down his eyes.
* Picture Wolverine sitting calmly in this field, onions causing tears to stream down his cheeks as he reflect on what he's done.
