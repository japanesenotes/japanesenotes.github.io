## Mnemonics
 * You're <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sick</span> because you put an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> arrow</span> in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> and tried to eat it. To be honest, that's just really <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stupid</span>. You have to be stupid to try to eat an arrow. You deserve to be sick.
* How stupid do you have to be to put arrows into your mouth until it makes you sick? Pretty darn stupid, it seems.
* The only way to cure this serious a case of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> stupid</span> is to make you eat <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chee</span>se (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ち](https://jisho.org/search/ち)</span>). Not only will it fix your sick stomach by cushioning all the arrows that you shoved in your stupid mouth, but it should send smart cheese waves to your brain and cure you of that stupid all together.
* Imagine if everyone knew that cheese cures the stupid out of people. Then maybe we would have more cheese and less stupid in the world!
