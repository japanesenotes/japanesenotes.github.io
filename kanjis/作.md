## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span>'s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> key</span> is the key that <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> make</span>s all the other keys. It's sort of like the one ring to rule them all, the one ring to bind them... except with keys.
* Imagine the leader taking his key to open up a safe that has a button to make other keys for the underlings. No key is as great as this key, though.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> make</span> a key for an underling, and he looks at it disapprovingly (even though you're their leader!). He simply says, this key <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sucks</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さく](https://jisho.org/search/さく)</span>) and then walks off. How could this be?
* Feel angry about this. Maybe you should kick your foot in his mouth and make him <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suck</span> on that.<br />Also keep in mind that there's another reading that pops up too that's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> さ</span>. It's similar to <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さく](https://jisho.org/search/さく)</span>, though, and I think you'll be able to learn both the readings via the vocabulary.
