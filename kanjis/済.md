## Mnemonics
 * You see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> that's <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> simultaneous</span> (with another tsunami, I assume) and you know the world is about to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> come to an end</span>.
* Imagine a tsunami simultaneously happening as the world comes to an end. Oh no, isn't there any way to stop this!?
* Just as the world is about to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> come to an end</span>, your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cy</span>borg (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さい](https://jisho.org/search/さい)</span>) appears and blocks it with its cyborg body!
* So the world won't come to an end this one time, thanks to the cyborg you made. Though it doesn't look very good. The cyborg is beaten up and full of water. This might be the end for it...
