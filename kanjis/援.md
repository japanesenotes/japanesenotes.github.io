## Mnemonics
 * You use your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> in the game of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> football</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> aid</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> assist</span> the other players. And when you smash your fingers in football, you need to get some aid yourself.<br />If you're from the UK, just imagine someone kicking or stomping on your fingers instead.
* Picture yourself playing football. You catch the ball with your fingers and then assist your team by running and smashing your body into the enemy team. But in the process you smash your fingers... so you need to go to the aid tend.
* When you need <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> aid</span> for your football wrecked fingers you can't help but feel like it's the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> en</span>d (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [えん](https://jisho.org/search/えん)</span>) for you. Your fingers hurt so much, you don't even want the nice nurses to aid you.
* You can't assist your team anymore because you got hurt. This isn't fair! It's the end. The end of your life and your career. Boo hoo hoo!
