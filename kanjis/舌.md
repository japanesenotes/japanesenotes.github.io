## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tongue</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tongue</span> kanji are exactly the same! Yee-haw!
* 
* You’re sound asleep in bed when your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tongue</span> drops out of your mouth and you start to drool, getting saliva all over the bed <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sheet</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [した](https://jisho.org/search/した)</span>). You wake up with a soggy patch of sheet near your mouth and wipe the drool off your face. Your significant other sees the whole thing.
* Your significant other had been watching you sleep with your tongue out for a while now, so you're super embarrassed you wet the sheets with your nasty tongue drool. You feel very judged and embarrassed.
