 * You can CHOOSE between the two snakes but both are poisonous.<br><br>You want to get a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> so you have one of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> yourself</span> (<span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> oneself</span>) and another self working <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> together</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> choose</span>. The two tiny yous sit on each of your shoulders and argue about which scooter you should choose.
* The white self says you should choose the safest scooter. The red self says safety is for suckers, and you should buy one that's loud and dangerous and covered in flames.
* Suddenly your selfs both gasp and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> choose</span> the scooter in front of you that looks like a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cen</span>taur (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せん](https://jisho.org/search/せん)</span>). The scooter is designed like a human on the top, the bars are its arms, and the bottom with the seat and the wheels are all horse. This centaur is what you choose to ride.
* The white self says, I choose this centaur scooter because of its strong arms. The red self says, I choose this scooter because it looks like a badass horse monster, wooh!
