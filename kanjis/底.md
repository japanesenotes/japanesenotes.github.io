## Mnemonics
 * Under a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> canopy</span> your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> clan</span> digs in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span>, trying to get to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bottom</span>. They want to build a nice home your entire clan can live in, but they need to get to the bottom before they'll start building.
* Picture all of the people in your clan under this canopy digging with all their might, trying to find the bottom. Isn't there... no bottom though? you think to yourself.
* Suddenly someone down in the hole shouts that they've reached the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bottom</span>, but it's full of water and they're all <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> soak</span>ed (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そこ](https://jisho.org/search/そこ)</span>)!
* The bottom is full of water, and everyone and everything down there is soaked through now.
