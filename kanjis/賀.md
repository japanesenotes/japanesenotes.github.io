## Mnemonics
 * You use the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> power</span> of your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> to spit <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> at people as a form of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> congratulations</span>! In fact, you yell CONGRATULATIONS! as the shellfish come pouring out of your powerful mouth.
* Shellfish were once used as currency, so this totally makes sense. Just think of the shellfish as money coming out of your mouth as you say your congratulations.
* When you say <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> congratulations</span> like this, you look just like a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ga</span>rgoyle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [が](https://jisho.org/search/が)</span>). You're crouching down, your mouth wide open, just like a stone gargoyle.
* The next time you're congratulating someone, assume the gargoyle stance and dump all of their congratulatory shellfish on them from your mouth.
