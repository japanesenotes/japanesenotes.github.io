## Mnemonics
 * An <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> elf</span> who ventures outside in <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> has a lot of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> daring</span>. Elf ears are very, very delicate, and the winter cold can really mess them up. So if you see an elf adventuring in winter, know that that particular elf is a really daring dude.
* Imagine how much daring it would take to go outside in winter knowing you could be freezing your precious elf ears off.
* The amount of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> daring</span> you'd need is about equal to the amount Genghis <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Khan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かん](https://jisho.org/search/かん)</span>) had. And he was really daring!
* Do you think you have the same amount of daring as an elf going out in winter and Genghis Khan? Tell the truth.
