## Mnemonics
 * Under a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span>, but still in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span>, a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> woman</span> is laying out a fabulous <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> banquet</span>. The woman doesn't want anyone to burn from the sun, but banquets are best outside, so she's set up a roof to protect her and her guests.
* Picture a large banquet of food on a sunny day, covered by an outdoor roof, and a woman carefully setting it all up.
* Unfortunately, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> banquet</span> roof comes crashing down right before the guests arrive, and it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> end</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [えん](https://jisho.org/search/えん)</span>) before it can start.
* Honestly though, have you ever been to a banquet that ended well? Something always goes wrong when you have that many people under one roof.
