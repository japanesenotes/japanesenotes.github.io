## Mnemonics
 * Deep in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> soul</span>, you feel like you want to pull your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fang</span>s out by the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> root</span>, but instead you let out a loud <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sigh</span>. You're one of the only people you know that has fangs, and it weighs heavily on your soul.
* Imagine all of the other people staring and pointing, the kids making fun of you, no one seeing you as equal. And just... sigh. Deep down, you want to get rid of your fangs, but you can't do it.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sigh</span> again and say, I wish I was just a normal <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> guy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がい](https://jisho.org/search/がい)</span>). I swear the rest of me is a guy like the rest of you. *sigh*
* Now you're staring in the mirror at yourself. You sigh loudly and take out the pliers. You'll be a guy like everyone else. S-soon. As soon as you can muster up enough strength to stop sighing and rip these fangs out.
