## Mnemonics
 * If you have <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gold</span> you also need a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> guard</span> with a very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sharp</span> sword to protect it.
* You should probably also get some sharp spikes, sharp traps, and sharp spears to keep that gold safe too. Just a bunch of sharp stuff.
* You're setting up all these sharp traps around your gold when you step on a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sharp</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> a</span>corn (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [えい](https://jisho.org/search/えい)</span>) that's just laying on the floor. Ouch! But wait, then you get a great idea!
* Imagine covering the floor around your gold in sharp acorns. This is basically a Home Alone situation, and anyone who tries to steal your stuff is gonna get stuck full of sharp things and probably stabbed by your guard.
