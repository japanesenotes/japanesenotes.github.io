## Mnemonics
 * “Don’t <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> loiter</span> – <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> run</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Junior</span>!” said Indiana Jones Senior to Indiana Jones Junior. They’re escaping from a sticky situation involving Nazis and Junior was just loitering around like a fool. It’s no time to loiter, it’s time to run!
* Imagine Sean Connery saying “Don’t loiter – run, Junior!” and you should have a much easier time remembering this phrase if you remember it in his voice.
* Deciding not to loiter any longer, Indiana Jones <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Junior</span> takes his dad’s advice and starts to run. Unfortunately he wasn’t paying attention to where his feet were and he stubbed his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to</span>e (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [と](https://jisho.org/search/と)</span>) on a jagged rock. His toe is in so much pain that he can’t bear to run any longer and gets overtaken by the Nazis that were chasing them.
* Imagine yourself as Indiana Jones Junior and this happened to you. Feel the terrible pain of your stubbed toe as Nazis surround you. Hear them jabbering about in German as you clutch your throbbing toe.
