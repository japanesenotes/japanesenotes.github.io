## Mnemonics
 * one day I might get a LIP RING, it is POSSIBLE, what a fucking world....<br><br><br>With a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lip ring</span>, anything is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> possible</span>. Having a lip ring grants you the power to conquer any obstacle, achieve any goal. As long as it's a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> passable</span> lip ring, that is. If it isn't good enough, it isn't possible to be passable.
* Imagine getting a magical lip ring. First, you have to find a passable one. Then, you have to go through the pain of having your lip pierced. Is it even possible to imagine how painful that would be?!
* Since anything and everything is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> possible</span> with your new <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> passable</span> lip ring, you use it to get a new <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>). You go to the car dealership and ask for a free (passable) car. The manager is impressed with your lip ring and gladly hands over the keys to the latest model of your favorite car. Not bad.
* It was possible to get this passable car thanks to your lip ring. Hooray!
