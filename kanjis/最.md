## Mnemonics
 * Let the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> shine into your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ear</span> while sitting on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span> and make sure <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> most</span> of it gets in your head. You want to fill your brain with the most sun anyone has ever.
* Most of the sun is getting into your ear, but not all of it. Darn, maybe you should try angling yourself a different way. 
* <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Most</span> of this is for your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cy</span>borg (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さい](https://jisho.org/search/さい)</span>). You're testing out a new way to power it, but if you can't get most of the sun into your ear, it won't be enough to power most of the cyborg's robo-parts.
* Install the part into your cyborg. As long as most of the sun gets into its human ear, most of its cyborg bits will have power.
