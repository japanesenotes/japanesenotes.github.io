## Mnemonics
 * If you have one <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span> and another <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span>, you have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pair</span> of stools. Look at this pair of stools. Look at it.
* Imagine being in front of this pair of stools. Picture yourself sitting on one stool, getting up, then sitting on the other. Repeat this process.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pair</span> of stools shares a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>). Even if you tried to separate them, they'd eventually find their way back together.
* It's the same with pairs of socks and pairs of people. Sometimes what looks like two things is really a perfect pair, with one soul. Meant to be together forever.
