 * On your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scarecrow</span> because you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rich</span>. You want to scare away all the poor, non-rich people so you put a scarecrow on your roof.
* Imagine looking up at the roof at this scarecrow. There's a sign around its neck that says, Rich people welcome. Ah, you're safe. Time to go to bed!

You call the police and they call you a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foo</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>)! Pardon me?! You basically put an advertisement on your roof telling everyone you're rich. Of course you got robbed, you fool.
