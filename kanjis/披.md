## Mnemonics
 * Press your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> in someone's <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> skin</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> expose</span> what's underneath. This is pretty gross, but sometimes it's more important that you expose the cause of the problem, than avoiding something uncomfortable.
* Close your eyes. Picture someone's arm. Now touch their skin with your fingers and peel it back to expose the muscles and bones underneath.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> expose</span> a small hole under their skin and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> he</span>at (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひ](https://jisho.org/search/ひ)</span>) comes pouring out. Aha! You knew there was something wrong under here. Apparently there's something under this person's skin that's exuding way too much heat.
* Imagine the heat steaming out, like it's coming out of a teapot, not out of somebody's arm skin.
