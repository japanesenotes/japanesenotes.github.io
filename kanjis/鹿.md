## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> canopy</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> helicopter</span> are being <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> compare</span>d by a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deer</span>. The deer is standing very still (as deer do) and looking very slowly between the empty canopy and the helicopter sitting next to it.
* Picture the deer comparing the two structures. It probably has no idea what they are, but it's trying very hard to understand what it's seeing anyway.
* You walk forward, about to call out to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deer</span>, when a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>) suddenly appears out of no where and runs the deer over! Was this all just a trap set up to murder the deer?!
* Deer get hit by cars all the time, but it was still really shocking . I mean it was right in front of you. The car could have hit you too!
