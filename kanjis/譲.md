## Mnemonics
 * When you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Nurse</span>! you're ready to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> defer</span> to them.
* If you say nurse you're asking something of a nurse. For this story, pretend like you don't know what to do, so you're going to defer to their skill and let them take over.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> defer</span> to the nurse because you're trying to save the local farmhand, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Jou</span>rm (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょう](https://jisho.org/search/じょう)</span>), and you can't do it. He's bleeding a lot, and you don't know what to do.
* It makes sense to defer to the knowledge of a medical professional. When going through this story, imagine yourself trying to revive Jourm, but nothing you do works. That's why you defer to the nurse. Save Jourm, you say. He's just a simple, kinda weird, ten foot tall farmhand with nine toes.
