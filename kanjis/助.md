## Mnemonics
 * With <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> top hat</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> power</span>, you're able to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> help</span> anyone.
* Imagine putting on your top hat and getting power from it. Then, you use that power to help someone. It's important to make the association that it's the top hat giving you the power to help that person. You're basically Frosty the Snow Man.
* The person you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> help</span> with your top hat power? It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Jo</span>-Anne (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょ](https://jisho.org/search/じょ)</span>).
* You can imagine saving her however you like. Perhaps she was under a car, and you used your top hat powers to help her out of that situation by lifting it above your head.<br />Note: Jo-Anne is the character we're using with <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょ](https://jisho.org/search/じょ)</span> reading mnemonics. She is short compared to Jourm (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょ](https://jisho.org/search/じょ)う</span>), the giant farmhand, which is how you'll differentiate the two similar readings.
