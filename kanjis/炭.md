## Mnemonics
 * You climb up a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mountain</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cliff</span> in search of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fire</span>, but all you find is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> charcoal</span>. You can make fire with the charcoal, but you were hoping to find fire itself. All that climbing for nothing.
* You’re angry that you could only find charcoal so you take the charcoal in your hands and you crush it atop the cliff on the mountain. Feel the charcoal breaking in your hands as the wind carries the charcoal dust off from the top of the cliff on the mountain.
* After crushing the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> charcoal</span>, you decide to take advantage of your current location and lay out in the sun for a while to get a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tan</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たん](https://jisho.org/search/たん)</span>). Instead of getting a tan though, you catch on fire. Oops.
* Imagine lying out in the sun next to the crushed charcoal, thinking you’re going to get tan. You’re very surprised when you actually catch on fire. Hot hot hot!
