 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> woman</span> is making a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cage</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span>. She's using it to trap water, making this a dirt <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dam</span>. If you think about it, dams are just dirt cages anyway.
* Picture the woman working tirelessly in the hot sun, moving and shaping the dirt around this river into a dam to make a pond.
* Something about the woman working hard to build this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dam</span> makes her super <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sexy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せき](https://jisho.org/search/せき)</span>) to you. Maybe it's because the sun is so bright, making her shine, or maybe it's because hard work is attractive. Who knows.
* If you wanna be sexy maybe you should build a dam too.
