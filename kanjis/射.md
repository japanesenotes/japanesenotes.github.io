## Mnemonics
 * You need to take a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> body</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> measurement</span> before you can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shoot</span>. Whether it's for a photo shoot, you're gonna shoot them with a gun, or if you're about to shoot them full of radiation for X-rays, you need the right measurements of that body first.
* Imagine someone measuring your body before they shoot you. You hope it's the good kind of shoot and that you're not going to die.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shoot</span> is being done by a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sha</span>man (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゃ](https://jisho.org/search/しゃ)</span>). Not only is he doing the body measurements for the shoot, but he's also going to be shooting you with a shot so you don't get the flu.
* Shamans are just a different kind of doctor. And this shot is going to save you from getting the flu, which could kill you. Make sure you always go to the local shaman and schedule a shooting.
