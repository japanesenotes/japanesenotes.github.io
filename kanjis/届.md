## Mnemonics
 * The American <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> reason</span> you need to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deliver</span> this package. The flag is inside the package, and you need to deliver it to the president. He lost his old flag, so now it’s up to you to deliver this new one to him. What more of a reason do you need?
* You need to deliver this flag to the president. Imagine yourself running as fast as you can while carrying the parcel in order to get it to him. Your lungs are tired and your legs burn, but you must deliver the flag as soon as possible!
* To <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deliver</span> this flag is something you just have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> to do</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とど](https://jisho.org/search/とど)</span>). Need to do. Want to do. There is no one else to do it. This is something only you are equipped to do.
* The world depends on you to do this delivery. If you fail, the United States will be ruined. You have to do it! Deliver that flag now! Run! Run!
