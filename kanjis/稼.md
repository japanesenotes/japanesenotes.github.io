## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grain</span>s you have stored in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> house</span> reflect on your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> earnings</span>. If you earn a lot of money, you have more grains.
* Imagine looking at the grains in the houses of people who make vastly different earnings. The poor artist has only a few sacks of grain. The rich samurai has an extra house just for holding his grain. That's how you know he has much higher earnings than the artist.
* Another way to check someone's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> earnings</span> is to see if they have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>). Would someone who doesn't make a lot of money have a car? No!
* Picture your own earnings. Can you afford a lot of grains and a car?
