## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flood</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fire</span>! At the same time? This is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> disaster</span>!
* Imagine a disaster so bad that there are floods AND fires. That's too much!
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> disaster</span> was caused by your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cy</span>borg (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さい](https://jisho.org/search/さい)</span>)! It's malfunctioning, running around leaking large amounts of water and breathing fire. I guess you didn't work out all the kinks before you let it roam wild.
* You better figure out a way to stop your cyborg from causing more disasters like this. Fix it now, or you're gonna be in big trouble.
