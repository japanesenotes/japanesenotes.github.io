## Mnemonics
 * On your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stamp</span> that you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> strike</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beat</span> to create a beat! The stamp looks like a little drum, but you're really just hitting your mouth for fun (the stamp was an excuse to make it seem normal).
* Put a stamp on your mouth and look in your bathroom mirror. Now strike that stamp and make a fresh new beat the young kids can dance to!
* As you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> strike</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> beat</span> your own mouth, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span> comes dancing into your bathroom. Hey now, this looks fun, can I beat your mouth up a bit too? he asks.
* <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> doesn't wait for you to remove the stamp to answer, and instead starts striking your mouth to make his own beats. Rude! He should have asked for permission before beating on you, even if you would have said yes.
