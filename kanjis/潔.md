## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> takes <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> life</span>, cuts it like a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sword</span> through <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span>, and leaves everything behind completely <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pure</span>. Everything is dead and gone, wiped clean off the face of the earth, thanks to the tsunami. It's back to the way it was before humans were here, it's completely pure.
* Picture the tsunami purifying the land of life, and in your mind see the sword cutting clean through the thread of life.
* After the tsunami pulls away, everything left is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pure</span> white. You hate this, so you run over and squirt <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ketsu</span>p (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けつ](https://jisho.org/search/けつ)</span>) all over the place to make it not so pure.
* The area is SO pure that the ground absorbs the ketsup and now it's all pure... ketsup color.
