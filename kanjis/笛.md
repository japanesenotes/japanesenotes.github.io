## Mnemonics
 * Is there a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> reason</span> you're in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bamboo</span> grove? Why yes there is. It's so you can get yourself some bamboo and make a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flute</span> out of it.
* Imagine yourself cutting down some bamboo, thinking this is the reason I'm here, I need a flute, asap! There is no other reason to be here besides this.
* You cut down the bamboo and whittle a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flute</span>. You start playing a song. You know the reason why. An alien spacecraft comes flying down and drops a box full of alien <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tech</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てき](https://jisho.org/search/てき)</span>) in front of you. 
* You've done what you came to do. You summoned an alien craft with your bamboo flute, gaining some alien tech in the process. Open up the box to see what tech awaits you.
