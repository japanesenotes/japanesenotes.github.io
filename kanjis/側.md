## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> has a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span> in its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> side</span>. It's fine though, don't worry, it's just a reminder that he won the great shellfish war back when they were trying to choose the new leader.
* Picture the shellfish leader in your mind and make sure to pay special attention to the knife that's sticking out of his side. It's right in the groove of his shell.
* Because of this knife in his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> side</span>, he can't pronounce certain words correctly. The most obvious one is when he says <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [川](https://jisho.org/search/川)</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かわ](https://jisho.org/search/かわ)</span>), but it comes out of the side of his mouth as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> がわ</span>.
* Try saying <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かわ](https://jisho.org/search/かわ)</span> out the side of your mouth like the leader of the shellfish and you'll probably say <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がわ](https://jisho.org/search/がわ)</span> too. Don't stick a knife in your side though, we won't pay your medical bills when you complain to us that this mnemonic got you injured.
