## Mnemonics
 * You see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bully</span> take an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> insect</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dissolve</span> it in some acid. Bullies are messed up, mean people. They do awful things that normal kids and people wouldn't do... like dissolve a living creature.
* Actually... try to forget this one. Don't think about a bully dissolving things in acid. Think happy thoughts. Like... the bully getting dissolved instead and all the little insects coming back to life and being happy.
* The only bullies heartless enough to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dissolve</span> insects like this are youths (<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ゆう</span>). Do you really think an adult would melt a harmless critter? No. Only inexperienced youths could be so cruel.
* When you first read this and you pictured the bully dissolving the insect, you pictured them as a youth, right? See? It makes complete sense.
