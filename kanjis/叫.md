## Mnemonics
 * You have <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> vines</span>, so you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shout</span>! It's hard for you to talk normally, and even harder for people to understand you unless you shout.
* You were born with mouth vines (a rare condition where your mouth is always full of vines), so you've been shouting all your life. And yet people still can't hear you. It's very frustrating.
* You need to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shout</span> so that people can understand you through the mouth vines. You shout, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> きょうと</span>! because you hear there is a temple there for people with your condition.
* Imagine the word <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょうと]([きょう](https://jisho.org/search/きょう)と)</span> not coming out clearly because of your mouth vines. People can only hear the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょう](https://jisho.org/search/きょう)</span> part, so they don't know where you want to go. SHOUT LOUDER! <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょうと]([きょう](https://jisho.org/search/きょう)と)！</span>
