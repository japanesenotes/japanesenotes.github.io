## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> told you that a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flood</span> last <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> evening</span> seemed to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> be imminent</span>, and that there was nothing you could do to stop it. You felt it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> draw close</span>, coming in the darkness of the evening.
* Think back to last evening, when your fingers twitched and twisted, warning you as the flood started to draw close.
* As the flood began to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> draw close</span> you knew there was nothing you could do, so you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sat</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さつ](https://jisho.org/search/さつ)</span>) down  and waited.
* You sat down and now you're still there, waiting for the flood. It's still drawing closer... it'll come eventually.
