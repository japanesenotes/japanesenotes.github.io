## Mnemonics
 * When you're driving, you may notice the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span>s in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> near the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> exit</span>s. These flags mark the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ditch</span> running along the side of the road. You won't want to try to exit the road here or you'll end up stuck in one.
* Picture the flags in the dirt. Picture the ditch just over the edge of them. Now look for another way to exit this road, cause that way is just not a good idea.
* If you do end up veering into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ditch</span> you'll find yourself yelling, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Holy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ほり](https://jisho.org/search/ほり)</span>) crap! Then you'll go hurtling into the ditch.
* It's a pun, get it? Holy. Hole-y. The ditch is a long hole. See? It's funny.
