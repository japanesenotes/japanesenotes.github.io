## Mnemonics
 * What you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> righteousness</span>, at least that's what you believe. You keep talking and saying these things, and you don't listen to anyone else's words. This is your style of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deliberation</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> discussion</span>.
* Picture yourself in a deliberation with some other people. They think what they're saying is right, and it drives you mad. Then you realize that you're doing the same thing.
* What are you in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deliberation</span> about? Whether or not to send some poor soul to the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gui</span>llotine (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぎ](https://jisho.org/search/ぎ)</span>). I think he should go, you say. I don't think he should, says another. This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> deliberation</span> is going nowhere...
* Imagine how the deliberation concludes. Then, at the end, someone says This deliberation is over! We have decided to _________ (in regards to the guillotine).
