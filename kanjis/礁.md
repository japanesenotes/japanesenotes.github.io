## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stone</span> that looks like a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> boil</span>ing underwater is just a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reef</span>.
* It may seem like there are a bunch of turkeys under there, but it's just the shape the reef takes. Though I guess if you're looking from above the water it really does look like a bunch of turkeys freaking out.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reef</span> is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun's (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>) favorite place to be nowadays. He sits next to the water, and stares down into it for hours.
* You don't know if the Shougun likes the reef because he likes the beauty of the ocean, or if he's fantasizing about turkeys boiling. He's a... complex man.
