## Mnemonics
 * You jump on your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> as your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mama</span> asks you to do a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> task</span> for her so you can <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pass through</span> her. And it's not just her, you pass through the entire house, trying to avoid the task your mama wants you to do.
* Imagine passing through your house on your scooter, not stopping so you don't have to do the task your mama just asked you to do.
* As you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pass through</span> the house, your mama yells, WELL NOW YOU HAVE TO DO THIS TASK <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> TOO</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つう](https://jisho.org/search/つう)</span>)! Too?! Great now you have two things to do for her too.
* Now you have to do this task too, all because you tried to pass through the house and ignore your mama. I guess it's what you deserve though.
