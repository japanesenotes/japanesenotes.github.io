## Mnemonics
 * When the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> faces the right <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> direction</span>, everyone on earth becomes <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> obese</span>. The pull of the moon moves all the water on earth as well as inside us, so when it faces the right way, we all get super <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fat</span>.
* Picture the moon turning to face a different direction. Feel your body start to become really obese. You get huge and round just like the moon.
* You look around and everyone is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> obese</span> like you. You try to reach out to them, but you roll over like a big <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bow</span>ling (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼう](https://jisho.org/search/ぼう)</span>) ball. The person next to you does too. Soon you're all rolling around like helpless, obese bowling balls.
* Picture yourself, as obese and round as a bowling ball, rolling faster and faster down hills. Other people are rolling around you too. You're all screaming. You want the moon to face the other direction so it will stop. You don't like being a human bowling ball!
