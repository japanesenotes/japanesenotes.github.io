## Mnemonics
 * Stick your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mohawk</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pluck</span> each hair out, one by one.
* Imagine plucking the hairs out of your mohawk with your fingers. It's kind of hard to grab onto them at first, but eventually you're plucking them like it's nothing.
* You want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pluck</span> all your mohawk hair out because you're a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> techie</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [てき](https://jisho.org/search/てき)</span>), and everyone at your techie job keeps making fun of you for your hair choices. Techies should be bald! your boss screamed. So here you are, plucking your hair out to fit in.
* You didn't realize techies were so inclusive... but they just plucked and plucked at your self-esteem, until you decided to pluck your hair out of your own head.
