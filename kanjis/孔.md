## Mnemonics
 * You see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> child</span> with an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> umbrella</span> in front of you. Suddenly, they fall straight down into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cavity</span> in the road. It's a big <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hole</span>!
* You run over to where the child fell. They are just fine! Because they had an umbrella, they were able to float to the bottom.
* Into my <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cavity</span> you go! yells a voice. It is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> こういち</span>. 
* You will stay in that cavity and/or hole until you repent. If it hasn't been clear up until now, Emperor <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こういち](https://jisho.org/search/こういち)</span> is going mad with power.
