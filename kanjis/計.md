## Mnemonics
 * If you want to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> how big a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> is, you have to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> measure</span> it. You can't say the size of something without measuring it first.
* Imagine trying to use your hands to show the size of this cross, but the other person shakes their head and says, Use your words! Ugh, okay, you'll have to measure it then.
* You need to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> measure</span> this cross but all you have is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>ke (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けい](https://jisho.org/search/けい)</span>). Good enough! I'm sure all cakes are exactly the same size, so they're a reliable unit of measure.
* This cross measures two cakes wide and three cakes long, you say.
