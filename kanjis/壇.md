## Mnemonics
 * On the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> there is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lid</span> trying to cover the number of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> times</span> the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dawn</span> has risen here. You walk over and pull the lid off and the whole thing transforms into a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> podium</span>. A podium for the dawn to tell you how many times it's risen over this dirt over and over again. It just keeps going and you realize the lid was here because this dang podium can't seem to keep a lid on it! (Get it? Figure of speech!)
* This kanji also just... really looks like a podium right? With a guy wearing a graduation cap, pointing toward you, in the crowd.
* You listen to what the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> podium</span> has to say for so long you finally can't help but ask, Who are you? I'm the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dawn</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だん](https://jisho.org/search/だん)</span>), of course! And this is my podium where I spread the good news about the dawn!
* I guess that makes sense. This podium is by the dawn for the dawn.
