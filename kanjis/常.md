## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> viking</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> towel</span> is a totally <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ordinary</span> thing. It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> normal</span>.
* Vikings get a lot of nasty stuff on their mouths from their messy eating and pillaging, so it makes sense that they'd all have mouth towels. It's as ordinary and normal as it gets, at least amongst the vikings.
* It's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ordinary</span> for a viking to have a mouth towel, but your sloppy farmhand friend <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Jou</span>rm (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょう](https://jisho.org/search/じょう)</span>) has a mouth towel too. That's a habit that's only <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> normal</span> for vikings, so why does he have one?
* When you ask Jourm about his Viking mouth towel, he just tells you, It's ordinary for everyone to have mouth towels. Totally normal. Now that you think about it, he is a really messy dude, he probably needs it.
