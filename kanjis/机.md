## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> combines with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> table</span> to make a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> desk</span>. When you think about it, a desk is just a table with more stuff. To make this more stuff, like drawers and such, you need more wood, and wood comes from trees. Add materials from the tree to the table and you have a desk.
* Chop this tree into pieces to transform this table into a desk. Hear the sounds of construction in your head as you make this desk with your bare hands.
* When you finish the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> desk</span> you turn to your friend and say, “<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> It’s cool, eh</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つくえ](https://jisho.org/search/つくえ)</span>)?” Your friend looks at you and says, “S’coo’ eh? What?” “This desk, it’s cool. It’s cool, eh?” “Aw, yeah man. S’coo’ eh.”
* Okay, so this is a pretty tricky one to make a reading mnemonic out of, if you can think of a better one, please email us. Until then, just imagine someone slurring “It’s cool, eh?” While you think about how cool this desk really is. Run your hands over the finished project as you say it.
