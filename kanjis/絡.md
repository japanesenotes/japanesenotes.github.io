## Mnemonics
 * If you put a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thread</span> in the middle of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> kiss</span>, you’re going to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> entangle</span> it. Things can get pretty messy in a kiss, so adding a thread to the mix will definitely entangle it.
* Imagine trying to kiss someone with a piece of thread between your lips. Feel the thread getting all entangled between the two of you as you lock lips. It’s really detracting from the experience.
* This is your first kiss ever so getting a thread to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> entangle</span> between your lips was really bad <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> luck</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [らく](https://jisho.org/search/らく)</span>). The person you were trying to kiss got really grossed out by the thread and tried to push you away but was so entangled with the thread that they were unable. Bad luck indeed.
* Picture yourself being tied to someone by the tongue with thread. You can’t escape, and you can’t believe your bad luck. Feel the thread tugging on your tongue as you try to get yourself untangled.
