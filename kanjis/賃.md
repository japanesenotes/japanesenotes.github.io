## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> who is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> king</span> of every <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> sets the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rent</span> for everyone. If you rent a home in King Shellfish's kingdom, the rent will be set by the great shellfish leader himself.
* King Shellfish loves when people rent from him. Imagine him rolling in all of the rent money (shellfish) he collected from all the people who rent from him. Hear his shell clattering as he frolics on all the dead shells from the shellfish.
* If you don't have enough shellfish to pay your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rent</span>, King Shellfish will punch you in the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chin</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ちん](https://jisho.org/search/ちん)</span>).
* Feel your entire body shaking, but especially your chin, as you tell him you're two shellfish short on rent this month. The last thing you see is his big fist coming right for your chin.
