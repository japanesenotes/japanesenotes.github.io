## Mnemonics
 * There is something <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> odd</span> sticking out of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span>. Oh wait, it's just the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cape</span> jutting out into the water below. Phew.
* It's just the cape sticking out into the sea. Haha, for a second... you thought... no...
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cape</span> below looks just like your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cy</span>borg (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さい](https://jisho.org/search/さい)</span>). Or rather, the cyborg you once had, before you had to give him up. It's kinda cross-shaped, it has a slide part, and lots of little fleshy bits. Ah, the memories.
* Picture the cape (the land mass that sticks out into water) but it's shaped just like your old cyborg. Weep a single tear.
