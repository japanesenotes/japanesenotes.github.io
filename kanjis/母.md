## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> lets out one <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span>, and then another <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span>. The drops dance together in the air, combine, and when they hit the ground, up sprouts your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mother</span>!
* Picture these two drops of the sun morphing before your very eyes until they look exactly like your dear ol' mum. She's bright and shining like the sun, and she's looking down at you, her big drop-eyes full of tears.
* Suddenly your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mother</span> points at you and laughs, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Haha</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はは](https://jisho.org/search/はは)</span>)! She keeps laughing, haha haha haha, over and over. You start to feel uncomfortable.
* You thought your mother was going to say something sweet or profound or motherly, and instead she's pointing and saying, Haha, over and over.<br />Yeah. That sounds like my mom.
