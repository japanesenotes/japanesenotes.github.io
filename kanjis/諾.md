## Mnemonics
 * You <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> say</span> something and the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flowers</span> are <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> right</span> in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> agreement</span>. The flowers see where you are coming from when you say what you say. You and the flowers are in complete agreement.
* What did you say to the flowers that you are so in agreement about? Think about what you said.
* You and the flowers are in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> agreement</span> on the fact that neither of you like when a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> duck</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だく](https://jisho.org/search/だく)</span>) walks across the flowers. You don’t like having a duck walk on the flowers because the duck will poo in the flowers and then you have to worry about stepping in it. And the flowers just don’t like having duck poo in their face.
* Imagine you are the flowers. There’s a duck. It’s making a poo. On you. Ew, man, that’s disgusting. Bleh.
