## Mnemonics
 * You can use a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> jackhammer</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> indicate</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> show</span> someone where the prize is buried. You buried the prize to keep it safe, but the jackhammer is great at unearthing it. Jackhammers do a great job and show where the treasure lies. They indicate quite clearly where one needs to go.
* Imagine using this jackhammer to show someone where the prize is buried. Feel the vibrations through your hands and the rest of your body.
* Actually, you're unearthing <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Je</span>sus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span>). He’s the treasure. For your soul. He’s here to show you that Jesus is still a hip and cool guy and he wants to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> indicate</span> to you that having faith in Jesus and God and stuff is super rad. Jesus is all like, “Who has two thumbs and wants to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> show</span> you the way of the Lord? This guy.”
* Picture Jesus getting all over the top and super preachy about his religious beliefs. He’s doing everything he can to indicate to the crowd that he’s the best, and show them how cool he is. Listen to Jesus preach to the crowd, desperate for their attention.
