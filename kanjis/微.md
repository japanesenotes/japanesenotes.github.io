## Mnemonics
 * You <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> loiter</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mountain</span>, reading off the numbers of <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> pi</span> on this <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> morning. Everything is so perfect, so mathematical here. You view it as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> delicate</span>. Not in the sense that it will break apart at any moment, more in the sense that there are smaller, more subtle things to be enjoyed on this mountain, which is why you loiter here doing math.
* You'll have to imagine the things you consider to be delicate. Is that the snow falling on the branches? Is it the breeze? Is it something else? That's for you to decide, but imagine it vividly whatever it is.
* Ah! Of course! The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> delicate</span> bumble <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> be</span>e (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [び](https://jisho.org/search/び)</span>), that is your epitome of delicate. It lands upon your finger, and you look at its every fiber of being.
* Picture yourself looking at the bee, thinking how each hair on its body is so delicate. Maybe it has a delicate aroma to go with it. A faint smell of honey?
