## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gladiator</span> in front of you draws his <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sword</span>. He points the sword at your chest and right when you think everything is about to end, you realize he's pointing the sword at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ticket</span> in your hand.
* Right! You needed to buy a ticket to see the gladiator! He doesn't want to kill you, he wants to check to make sure you bought a ticket.
* The gladiator happily marks your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ticket</span> with his blade, when <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ken</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けん](https://jisho.org/search/けん)</span>) the samurai pushes past you. He hold up his own sword, challenging the gladiator, who just shakes his head and points at your ticket again.
* Ken takes a long time to examine your ticket. I don't think he understands that he needs a ticket to fight the gladiator. Maybe you should give him yours.
