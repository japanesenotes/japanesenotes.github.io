## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Part</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rain</span>, part other stuff. I imagine this is what people thought the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> atmosphere</span> was made out of thousands of years ago.
* Imagine looking up into the sky, trying to figure out what the atmosphere up there is made out of. Your only lead: It's raining, a lot. So, the atmosphere must be partly made of rain, and it's just falling down.
* The reading for this kanji is actually the same as <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [分](https://jisho.org/search/分)</span>s. One trick about complicated kanji is they often take the reading of one of the pieces that they're made from. In this case it's <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [分](https://jisho.org/search/分)</span>, which is cool.
* Also, studying the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> atmosphere</span> is a ton of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fun</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふん](https://jisho.org/search/ふん)</span>), if you're into that sort of thing.
