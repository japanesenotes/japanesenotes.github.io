## Mnemonics
 * There's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mountain</span> coming out of the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> that you want to climb, but your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> forehead</span> needs a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> towel</span> for all your sweat. You don't have a towel, so you take off your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> belt</span> and tie it around your forehead.
* The belt is easy to tighten and it catches all the sweat before it can fall into your eyes. It isn't quite as absorbent as a towel though.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> belt</span> isn't absorbent enough, so you wrap it in your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> tie</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [たい](https://jisho.org/search/たい)</span>) and then tie the whole thing around your forehead again.
* It works! Your belt tied in a tie is the perfect invention!
