## Mnemonics
 * The CENTER LEADER (Annie Lööf) has a good RELATIONSHIP with Stefan Löfvén.<br><br>A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> middle</span> of the road <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> is likely to have an average <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> relationship</span> with everyone. He doesn’t really take sides in matters, and just stays in the middle. This makes him seem like sort of a wishy washy people pleaser, and as such his relationships with people are rarely anything more than average.
* I’m sure you’ve heard of “flip-floppers” in politics, or people who try and take both sides of an issue, always staying in the middle ground and never really taking a stand. Imagine one of these people to represent this kanji.
* Since this guy doesn’t really have a strong opinion on anything, you find yourself wondering what’s going on in his head. You wish there was a door <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> knocker</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [なか](https://jisho.org/search/なか)</span>) on his forehead so you could use the knocker to see if anyone’s home. You could knock and ask why he’s being such a middle of the road leader and give him suggestions about how he could grow a backbone and better his <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> relationship</span>s with people.
* Imagine your favorite flip-flopper from before. Now imagine that there’s a knocker on his forehead and you get to knock that knocker as hard as you like. Sounds like fun, doesn’t it? Imagine yourself doing this.
