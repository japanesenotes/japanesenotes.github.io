## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> self</span> radical and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> self</span> are the same in looks as well as in meaning.
* Radicals have self. Kanji has self. Kanji and radicals can sometimes be the same thing... so do they really have self? Only way to find out is to study both of them hard!
* When we need to remember <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span> we use the word Jesus.<br />Who said you should always look at your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> self</span> before tossing stones (or whatever) at others? <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Je</span>sus (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じ](https://jisho.org/search/じ)</span>) did. So, make sure you look at your own self before being a jerk.
* You can feel free to do some introspection here.
