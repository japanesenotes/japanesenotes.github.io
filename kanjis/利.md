## Mnemonics
 * Cut <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grain</span>s with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span> to make them smaller and you'll make a great <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> profit</span>. By cutting them, now you can get three grains worth of money for what was once a single grain. 
* Imagine buying some rice. Now cut all the grains with a knife into smaller grains. Now sell them for two, three, four times the profit!
* To make an even better <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> profit</span>, you decide to cut up <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ree</span>ds (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [り](https://jisho.org/search/り)</span>) too. You stuff the grains in the reeds and sell that as self-cooking sets.
* Picture all of your reeds full of grains in a row. The entire world will benefit from your crafty invention. And you'll turn a great profit too, which certainly doesn't hurt.
