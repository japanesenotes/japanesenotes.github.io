## Mnemonics
 * You have <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> water</span> already... and it's pretty cold. All it takes is one cold <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> drop</span> of liquid nitrogen added to it to turn it into one big block of ice, just like that.
* Go ahead and touch it... wow, it's really cold - and only from one drop, too. Feel the burn on your finger from where you touched the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ice</span>.
* When you think of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ice</span>, I want you to think of someone frozen with ice. Do you know anyone named <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Corey</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こおり](https://jisho.org/search/こおり)</span>)? Anyone famous named Corey, perhaps Corey Feldman? Imagine this Corey person frozen solid with ice.
* How did this happen? Was it your fault? Imagine the situation that would get Corey frozen like this.
