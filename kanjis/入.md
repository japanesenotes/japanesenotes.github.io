## Mnemonics
 * The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> enter</span> first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> enter</span> as well.
* Make sure you know those radicals, yo!
* Turns out, after you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Enter</span> the teepee (you'll remember that the radical is a teepee with a big entrance to it), you're given a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> new</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にゅう](https://jisho.org/search/にゅう)</span>) car!
* Imagine lights turning on and flashing, and an entire audience inside. You're at a gameshow, and the announcer announces the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> neeeeew</span> car in his announcey voice. Feel the surprise. Feel the happiness. Feel the excitement. Check the year on the car, too. It's this year! It really is new!
