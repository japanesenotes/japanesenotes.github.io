## Mnemonics
 * This is the sign above JUVI. It is juvenile to stand on top of your village, just because you can.<br><br>The people who <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stand</span> in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> village</span> are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> juvenile</span>s. They aren't babies, who crawl, and they aren't adults who sit in front of their computers all day. They're juveniles who stand.
* Picture all of the juveniles standing in your village. You used to stand out there too and it was really boring, but at least kids these days have phones to keep them company.
* Right now all of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> juvenile</span>s are standing in line to get <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dou</span>ghnuts (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [どう](https://jisho.org/search/どう)</span>). Free doughnuts, actually. Psh. Just like juveniles to get handouts, amirite?
* Look in disdain at the juveniles standing around with their delicious doughnuts. You're really jealous, I mean, you're really... mad! Those lazy... um... ah man. You really want one of those doughnuts. You miss being young.
