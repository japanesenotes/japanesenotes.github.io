## Mnemonics
 * When a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> grows <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> old</span>, it will <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wither</span>.
* Old trees' roots and leaves grow inefficient, and they can't get enough nutrients. It's only natural for them to wither up a little bit.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> wither</span>ed tree's best friend is a human <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> 子</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こ](https://jisho.org/search/こ)</span>). Imagine the child hugging the tree.
* It gave the <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [子](https://jisho.org/search/子)</span> its shade, its sap, and eventually its body to build a house. What an awful child, and what a generic giving tree.
