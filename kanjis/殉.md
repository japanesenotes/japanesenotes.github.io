## Mnemonics
 * Put a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> yakuza</span> member in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> prison</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> and he'll become a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> martyr</span> to all the other yakuza still on earth. He died up there so the rest of them wouldn't have to. Because they definitely aren't getting caught now, if the penalty is a burning death in the new sun prison.
* Imagine all the yakuza coming out into the streets and holding up signs saying this guy was a martyr. A hero to all who do bad stuff in bad groups but don't wanna get caught.
* The only reason he ended up a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> martyr</span> in the first place is because they put him up there in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> June</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じゅん](https://jisho.org/search/じゅん)</span>). Everyone knows the sun is way too hot for humans in June. It's summer!
* Really, it's not the fault of the people who put him there that he's become a martyr. It's the month of June. PUNISH JUNE! PUT JUNE IN THE SUN PRISON! (Is what I assume those yakuza are shouting.)
