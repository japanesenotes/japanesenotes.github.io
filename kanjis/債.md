## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> leader</span> gets the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> blame</span> if your company is in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> debt</span>. They're the one who led you all into that debt, so they should get the blame too.
* Picture the leader standing up in front of everyone as they blame him. He's holding a plaque with the amount of debt you're all in. Try to imagine what that number would be.
* To pay off this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> debt</span> your leader says you need to sell your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cy</span>borg (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さい](https://jisho.org/search/さい)</span>) to help the company. You fight him! You yell! You scream! The cyborg puts a half-human half-robot hand on your shoulder and shakes its head sadly.
* Watch as your cyborg saves your company, even though it wasn't even his responsibility, from crippling debt. *sob* I can't believe your cyborg is gone!
