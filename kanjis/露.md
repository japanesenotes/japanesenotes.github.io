## Mnemonics
 * If the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rain</span> touches your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> foot</span> and gives it a little rain <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> kiss</span>, you know that part of your foot is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> expose</span>d to the elements. You can also see some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> dew</span> forming on your exposed foot. So that's what rain kisses are!
* Ugh, you shouldn't have bought these open toed shoes, at least not during rainy season!
* You run along the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ro</span>ad (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ろ](https://jisho.org/search/ろ)</span>), trying to get out of the rain, but the road keeps going and going, with walls on both sides.
* You wonder how long this road will go. With exposed toes, your feet are going to get all wet with dew if you can't get off this blasted road.
