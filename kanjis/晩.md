## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> has an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> excuse</span> for disappearing at <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> night</span>. The sun gets really tired, same as anyone else – so when night rolls around the sun excuses itself and goes to sleep. It’s a valid excuse.
* Imagine you’re the sun, working all day. Of course you get tired. This is a good excuse to go to bed at night and get some rest. Feel how sore and hot and sweaty and exhausted you are after a hard day’s work of being the sun.
* Since you’re the sun, it’s pretty bright, so before you excuse yourself for the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> night</span>, you’re wearing Ray-<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ban</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばん](https://jisho.org/search/ばん)</span>) sunglasses. You keep these Ray-Ban sunglasses on all day to protect your eyes from being burned by yourself.
* You’re a pretty cool dude. Ray-Bans are cool. You even wear them at night you’re so awesome. Yeah.
