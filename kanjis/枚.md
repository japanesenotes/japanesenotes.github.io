## Mnemonics
 * In the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span>, one can use a sliced up <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flat objects counter</span>. Since it’s winter, all the leaves have fallen off the tree, so it’s easy to cut into slats. These slats can be used as counters for flat objects, such as these slats.
* Imagine yourself counting these flat objects in winter. It’s super cold, but you have to count them. How many are there?
* While trying to count these slats of wood, a whole bunch of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mi</span>ce (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まい](https://jisho.org/search/まい)</span>) show up and start climbing all over the tree. This will not do, so you take two slats and start smashing and flattening all the mice. Now that the mice are flat too, you can also use them as a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> flat objects counter</span>. Good job, mice.
* Now imagine yourself counting on these mice you just smashed. They’re freshly dead, so there’s not much of a stench yet, but you still feel bad about using dead mice to help you count. Imagine yourself counting on these mice as you try to hold back tears from all the murder you just did.
