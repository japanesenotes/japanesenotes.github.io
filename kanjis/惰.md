## Mnemonics
 * In its <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> soul</span>, a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> narwhal</span> that's supposed to do <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> construction</span> under the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span>, will be too <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lazy</span> to do it. And when your soul is lazy, there's no way you'll be able to get something done.
* Picture the lazy narwhal laying on a block of ice in the moonlight. There are tools and other blocks of ice around, but he just can't seem to get up and do any construction work.
* You can't tell the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> lazy</span> narwhal he's being lazy because he's your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> da</span>d (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [だ](https://jisho.org/search/だ)</span>). If he was anyone else you'd tell him off for being lazy, but you can't tell off your dad. That's just not right.
* Picture your lazy dad. Your big, lazy narwhal dad.
