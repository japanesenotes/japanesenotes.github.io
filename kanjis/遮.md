## Mnemonics
 * You're riding your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scooter</span> toward your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> yurt</span> as fast as you can because someone is trying to get in there to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> boil</span> your water and you want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> intercept</span> them.
* If you manage to intercept them before they can go in there to boil things, you'll be able to pick up all the clothes and comic books you left on the floor. You really don't want anyone to see those.
* You manage to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> intercept</span> the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sha</span>man (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゃ](https://jisho.org/search/しゃ)</span>) who was just about to open the door to your yurt, and instead you crash right into him.
* Phew, you intercepted the shaman in time (though she doesn't look very happy about being scooted into) and now you can clean up your yurt before they go in.
