## Mnemonics
 * Walking on the ROAD.<br><br>If you’ve been walking all day, nobody is going to want to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> kiss</span> your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> foot</span> if you’ve been walking barefoot down a dirt <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> road</span>. Your feet are filthy, sweaty, and stinky. Nobody is going to want to kiss those feet.
* Imagine kissing someone’s foot. Now imagine kissing someone’s foot after they’ve been walking down a dirt road for hours. It’s disgusting. Smell the stench of dirt and sweat wafting up into your nostrils as the foot approaches your lips. It’s wretched.
* What was this person walking down again? Oh, that’s right – a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ro</span>ad (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ろ](https://jisho.org/search/ろ)</span>). They were walking down a dirt <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> road</span>.
* Walking down a dirt road barefoot like this is a sure way to dirty up your feet. Feel the dirt, rocks, and twigs under your feet. The road is hard and dry and is not making your journey very comfortable at all.
