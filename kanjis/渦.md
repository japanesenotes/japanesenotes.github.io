## Mnemonics
 * If you put two <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mustache</span>s on either side of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> it won't know which way to go and spin back and forth until it becomes as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> whirlpool</span>. Mustaches are pretty gross, so I don't blame the tsunami for avoiding them.
* Picture the tsunami spinning in a circle, trying not to hit the mustaches until it spins itself into a giant whirlpool.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> whirlpool</span> is huge, and it starts pulling things into itself. Oh no, is that my <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ca</span>r (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [か](https://jisho.org/search/か)</span>)? Hey, wait! Whirlpool give my car back!
* Picture my car getting sucked into the whirlpool. Picture me crying as my car disappears into it forever.
