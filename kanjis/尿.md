## Mnemonics
 * When you go to the pool or lake to swim, you'll see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span> stuck somewhere in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> water</span>. That flag is there so you know it's okay to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pee</span> in that area of the pool. Everyone knows <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> urine</span> dilutes in water, and if everyone just pees in one place, it won't be gross. So go pee over by that flag when you have to go. Don't bother getting out of the water.
* Imagine swimming over to the flag that's sticking out of the water and peeing there. Yeah, everyone knows what you're doing over there, but it's better than getting out and walking to the bathroom right? Just pee in the water. Just do it.
* Right as you start to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pee</span>, you hear the life guard start to yell, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> NYOOOOOO</span>! (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [にょう](https://jisho.org/search/にょう)</span>) and he's pointing at you! You were just peeing by the pee flag! Why is he mad?
* Imagine your embarrassment when you find out that you aren't supposed to urinate in the water, not even by the pee flag, because a life guard yelled NYOOOOOO and pointed right at you while you did it.
