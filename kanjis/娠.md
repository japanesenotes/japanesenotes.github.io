## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> woman</span> who has a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> landslide</span> getting ready inside her is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pregnant</span>. And that baby is gonna come out like a landslide.
* Picture an ultrasound of the pregnant woman, but instead of a little baby heartbeat, you hear a scary roaring sound. That's what being pregnant is like. Waiting for the landslide to come.
* When you're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> pregnant</span> the baby is constantly kicking you with their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shin</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しん](https://jisho.org/search/しん)</span>). Not their feet, their shins. And shins are really hard, let me tell you.
* Imagine being pregnant and getting kicked by the shins of you baby all day, but especially all night. You're so tired. Please let this landslide come already.
