## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> soul</span> is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> blue</span>. As in, it's sad and not feeling well. Your soul changes colors depending on what it's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> feeling</span> or what <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> emotion</span> you're expressing.
* Start with a blue soul. What feeling is that? Now a red soul. What emotion is that? Go through as many colors as you can think of, focusing on the fact that each color represents a different emotion or feeling.
* Why is your soul <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> feeling</span> blue? Because <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Jou</span>rm (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じょう](https://jisho.org/search/じょう)</span>) the big man farmhand did something mean to you. Imagine a story playing out, and then imagine your soul turning blue with emotion.
* Perhaps Jourm can't read. Or perhaps he doesn't want to see you again because of something you did. Whatever the story, make sure it makes you feel a little blue too.
