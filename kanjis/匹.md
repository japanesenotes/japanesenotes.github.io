## Mnemonics
 * In the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cage</span> there are some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> legs</span>. They are the legs attached to a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> small animal</span>.
* You can only see the legs, though, because a cloth is covering the cage. What kind of small animal is it? Try to look.
* You look up through the cloth, and see a hairless cat. This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> small animal</span> is hairless, but most surprisingly is covered in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hickie</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひき](https://jisho.org/search/ひき)</span>).
* Who is giving this cat all those hickies? Pretty gross, if you ask me.
