## Mnemonics
 * Regardless of whether or not you wear a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> hat</span> while you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> jackhammer</span>, you’re going to have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> surplus</span> of noise. Jackhammers are loud, and your hat is doing nothing to dampen the racket. There’s a surplus of commotion coming from the jackhammer and onlookers are not amused.
* The hat you’re wearing is ridiculous, giving you a surplus of bad style. Imagine a bunch of people scowling at you, not only because of your crazy hat, but because of the annoying sound of the jackhammer. Hear the obnoxious noise around you as the jackhammer rattles your bones.
* One of the people walking by is the owner of a push cart <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>-yo (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よ](https://jisho.org/search/よ)</span>) stand. Having a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> surplus</span> of yo-yos, he starts throwing them at you. This makes you stop using the jackhammer as you need both hands to fend off the yo-yo barrage.
* Your hat is doing little to defend you from the onslaught of yo-yos being tossed at you. Feel the yo-yos hitting your body and listen to them roll away after striking you.
