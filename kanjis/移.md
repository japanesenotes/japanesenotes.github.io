## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grain</span>, from one <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> evening</span> to the next <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> evening</span>, experiences a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shift</span>. After two evenings, the grain has shifted from one location to another.
* Picture the grain in your head with a time-lapse of one evening after another happening in the background. Slowly, the grain shifts.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shift</span> is caused by the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ea</span>gle (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [い](https://jisho.org/search/い)</span>) that wants to eat the grains. Every other evening, the eagle swoops down, shifts the grains (eating a few) and then flies off.
* Picture the eagle flying down on the second evening, scattering the grains it doesn't eat, shifting their location.
