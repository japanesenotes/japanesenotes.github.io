## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spicy</span> because you're the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> manager</span>. You're always testing new recipes in your house to share with everyone who works under you, but that makes all the spice stick to your roof (since it doesn't have good ventilation like a restaurant or a lab would).
* Picture yourself as the manager of a restaurant or a science lab. You have to test all of your managerial methods at home before you can bring them to work. And if you were to lick that roof of yours... it would be spicy from all of your experiments.
* You've finally done it. You're now the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> manager</span> of a bunch of spicy new <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cy</span>borgs (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [さい](https://jisho.org/search/さい)</span>). You've been toiling away for over a year, but you've finally replaced the cyborg you lost, and now you can manage them properly without anyone getting in the way. 
* Unfortunately, you couldn't figure out how to make non-spicy cyborgs, but that's okay because you're going to be the best cyborg manager ever! No one will ever take them away from you again.
