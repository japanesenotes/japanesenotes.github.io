## Mnemonics
 * You're in a really important position, <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heavy</span> with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> power</span>, but you can't carry all of that around with you, so you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> boil</span> it all down to just a few <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> merit</span>s.
* Most people in places heavy with power, like the scouts, boil down all of their responsibilities and accomplishments this way into merit badges.
* The only problem with consolidating your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> merit</span>s like this is that rac<span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> coon</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くん](https://jisho.org/search/くん)</span>) are always trying to steal them. Raccoons really like shiny, small things. Like, say, the physical representation of all your personal and professional merits.
* This is why you never see a military officer or a girl scout leaving their merit badges out in the open. They pin them right onto their clothes. Otherwise the raccoons would come.
