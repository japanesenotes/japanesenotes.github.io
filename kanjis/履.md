## Mnemonics
 * NOTE: The most common use is in はく, meaning to put on<strong>&nbsp;footgear</strong>, rather than actual<strong>footgear</strong>&nbsp;itself. STORY: You are asleep in camp when you are woken up with news that the FLAG has fallen to the enemy. You quickly PUT ON YOUR<strong>&nbsp;FOOTGEAR</strong>&nbsp;and run off to RESTORE the FLAG.<br><br>A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> loiter</span>s in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> black hole</span>. This flag marks (in the black hole) where you left your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boots</span>.
* If you look into the black hole, you can see your boots right there, marked with the flag.
* You grab your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> boots</span> from the black hole. In your boots (thanks to the shelter they provided), some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ree</span>ds (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [り](https://jisho.org/search/り)</span>) have grown in!
* It's amazing that these cute little reeds could grow in your boots in the middle of a black hole. As a great philosopher once said: life will find a way.
