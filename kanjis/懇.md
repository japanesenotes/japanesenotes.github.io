* They may seem gruff and rude at first, but they'll still let you in their home in the middle of winter unannounced and offer you tea, a warm fire, and a place to sleep.
* Badgers are especially <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> courteous</span> to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> con</span>dors (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [こん](https://jisho.org/search/こん)</span>). Condors live in the trees while badgers live in burrows under those trees. When humans tear down the condor's homes, the badgers who live below them always let them stay over until they get back on their feet.
* Picture a courteous badger taking care of an injured, and now homeless, condor. It's fluffing the condor's pillows, bringing it soup, and patting it on the shoulder saying, There, there.
