## Mnemonics
 * When a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> bird</span> opens its <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span>, you’re most likely to hear a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chirp</span>. This is how birds communicate. They open their mouths and let out a series of chirps. Chirp chirp chirp!
* Imagine yourself out in the wilderness on a sunny spring day. The weather is perfect and the scenery is beautiful. The only sound you can hear is the chirp of birds throughout the woods around you. It’s very peaceful.
* The best place to experience the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> chirp</span> chirping of birds is when you’re out in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> na</span>ture (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [な](https://jisho.org/search/な)</span>). You’re not going to hear birds chirping in a crowded city, so you need to get out into nature to fully experience the birds and their chirps.
* Nature is a great place to clear your mind and relax. Picture yourself in nature’s wilderness once again. The sun on your face, the wind in your hair, the grass beneath your feet, and the chirps of birds in the air. It’s quite nice.
