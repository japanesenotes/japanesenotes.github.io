## Mnemonics
 * The SPIRIT of a SCARECROW is good LUCK and FORTUNE for your crops.<br><br>When a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spirit</span> decides to live in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scarecrow</span>, you'll be granted good <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> luck</span>. Crows won't hang out in your farm. Everything you grow will become large and delicious. But not everyone is so lucky that a spirit will decide to live in their scarecrow. So maybe the luck was in you all along!
* Nope, the luck is definitely coming from the spirit in your scarecrow. You aren't lucky on your own.
* You want to check the scarecrow to make sure your recent <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> luck</span> is coming from it, so you kick it. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> F***</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふく](https://jisho.org/search/ふく)</span>) you! it yells. Oh yeah, there's a spirit in there.
* If you get a luck spirit to say f*** you, you might accidentally convince it to move somewhere else. If it does, you lose your luck. So be careful.
