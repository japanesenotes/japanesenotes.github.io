## Mnemonics
 * Without a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fire</span>, you will <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lack</span> the ability to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cook</span> anything. You really need a fire to cook properly. Having a fire will make sure any cooking endeavors you attempt will not fail.
* Imagine yourself as you cook with a fire very confidently. Knowing you cannot fail, feel the heat and hear the crackling embers of the fire. Smell the delicious smell of whatever you are cooking as well.
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cook</span> your meal evenly by <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> swi</span>nging (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すい](https://jisho.org/search/すい)</span>) it back and forth over the fire. You swing it left, you swing it right. You swing it to, you swing it fro. All this swinging ensures a properly cooked meal.
* Imagine swinging this meal over the fire. Feel the flames licking at your fingertips as you cook this meal by swinging it back and forth over the fire.
