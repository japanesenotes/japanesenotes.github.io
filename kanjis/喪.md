## Mnemonics
 * Under the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> is a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> and another <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> wearing special <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> clothes</span> because they're in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mourning</span>.
* Picture the cross looming overhead, people's mouths open so they can sob loudly, and everyone wearing the same color clothes (just picture whatever color works for your particular culture/religion combo).
* As the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mourning</span> continues, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>) of the dead person rises out of the cross. The soul looks around at all of the mourners and nods. Yes, your mourning has pleased it.
* If you aren't mourning enough, when the soul comes out of the person's body, it will get really mad. What, I'm not worth a few tears? Really? And then the soul will haunt you. So you better mourn like you mean it.
