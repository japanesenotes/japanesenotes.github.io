## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Flowers</span> that grow in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span> only live to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seedling</span>s. Once they sprout, they're plucked away to make room for more rice. Poor little seedlings.
* Picture the seedlings growing among the rice plants. Once they bloom they'll be picked, so let's hope they stay small as long as they can.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seedling</span>s try their best to blend in by referring to themselves as <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> myou</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [みょう](https://jisho.org/search/みょう)</span>), you know, me and you combined. That's myou.
* Listen to the little seedlings say myou over and over. Too bad the farmers can tell they aren't rice plants.
