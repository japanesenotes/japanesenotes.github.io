## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> pig</span> with <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horns</span> runs into a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> building</span> and makes it fall into the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span>. This makes a loud <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crash</span> sound. I mean, how could it not? The building literally crashed to the ground when the horned pig attacked it.
* Picture a pig with horns crashing into a building and both of them crashing into the dirt. Uh oh, is the pig dead?
* You're worried about the pig, that was a pretty big <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crash</span>, after all. So you yell, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> SOOEY</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [つい](https://jisho.org/search/つい)</span>)! Here pig pig pig. SOOEEEYYY! You know—the universal call for pigs
* Imagine walking around the crash site yelling Sooey! Sooey! over and over. You'll never know if the pig survived the crash if you don't.
