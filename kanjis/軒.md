## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> car</span> is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dry</span> because you kept it under the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eaves</span> of your house. <br />This kanji has a second meaning too: <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> house counter</span>. Imagine counting all the houses on your block by the number of eaves you see keeping cars dry.
* One eave, one house. Two eaves, two houses.
* On top of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> eaves</span> of your house <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ken</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けん](https://jisho.org/search/けん)</span>) the samurai is counting houses too.
* Ken hops down and explains that he's been hired to count all the houses in his lord's domain just because his name is the same as the counter for houses. It isn't really fair, he complains to you, as you try to sneak by and lock him out of your house.
