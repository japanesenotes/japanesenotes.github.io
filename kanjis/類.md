 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> big</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> geoduck</span> loves to eat <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice</span> of every <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> type</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kind</span>, and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> category</span>. It doesn’t matter what kind of rice it is, this big geoduck will eat it.
* Picture this big geoduck shoveling rice down in a flurry of geoduckness. Hear the sloshing and goopy glugging as the geoduck gorges itself on every type of rice.
* While eating every <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> type</span> and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kind</span> of rice from every <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> category</span>, the big geoduck has become even bigger. Its body is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rui</span>ned (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [るい](https://jisho.org/search/るい)</span>). It’s painfully obese. This geoduck has eaten itself into ruin.
* Picture this big, fat geoduck, too big to move. It’s now in a wheel chair and on a rice IV. Imagine its wheelchair squeaking by as it wheezes and groans.
