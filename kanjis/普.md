## Mnemonics
 * You <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> line up</span> your body with the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> and everything looks <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> normal</span>.  The sun is lined up behind you, and you’re looking at all the things the sun has lit up. Everything looks normal.
* Gaze out in a line from the sun as you observe the world. Everything is very normal looking and comforting.
* Soon you see something that doesn’t look so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> normal</span>. It’s a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foo</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ふ](https://jisho.org/search/ふ)</span>), a jester. Dressed all in fool’s garb, this fool is dancing up towards you with a ridiculously unsettling grin on his face.
* Imagine this creepy looking fool as he approaches. He’s kind of freaking you out. Feel very uncomfortable as you continue looking at this fool.
