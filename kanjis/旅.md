## Mnemonics
 * If your friendly neighborhood <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tofu</span> takes a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> gun</span> and points it in your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> direction</span>, you might want to take a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> trip</span>. This tofu obviously has something wrong with it. If it’s taking a gun and pointing it in your direction, now’s probably a good time to get away and take that trip you’d been talking about.
* Imagine this menacing block of tofu threatening you with a gun. Guns are scary so you want to get away. Use images of your trip to make the thoughts of the big bad tofu and his gun fade away.
* Your plan didn't work and the tofu went on your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> trip</span> with you. And now it's wearing your hotel <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ro</span>be (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りょ](https://jisho.org/search/りょ)</span>)! It looks so comfortable, wrapped up in the robe. That's the best part of going on trips, and he stole it from you.
* Imagine being stuck on a trip with a block of tofu that took your robe and is wearing it around, still pointing the gun in your face. This vacation has been ruined.
