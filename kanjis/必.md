## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slide</span> coming out of the patient's <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span> is there because a mad scientist is testing to see if it's a good way to drain the body of blood. The patient is alive now... but they are definitely slated for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> certain</span> death.
* As you imagine the mad scientist drawing blood out of the patient's heart with a small slide, also imagine a little meter hooked up to him as well. On one end is SURVIVE! on the other end is CERTAIN DEATH. Right now the finger is pointing close to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> certain</span> death, though :(
* As the beeping heart thing starts to do one long continuous beeeeeeeeeeeeeep, the doctor puts his hands together and <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hits</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ひつ](https://jisho.org/search/ひつ)</span>) the dead patient over and over, attempting to bring him back.
* Maybe imagine yourself running in there too, just trying to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> hit</span> the patient back to life, because the patient was your friend.
