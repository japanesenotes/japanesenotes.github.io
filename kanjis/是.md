## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> correct</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> absolutely</span>. The mighty sun is never wrong. It is absolutely correct, always.
* Imagine the sun in the sky. Its rays blind you as it corrects all of the errors you’ve made.
* Then, a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ze</span>ppelin (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぜ](https://jisho.org/search/ぜ)</span>) flies in front of the sun, blocking it out. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Absolutely</span>, the sun cannot ignore this transgression. Therefore, the sun corrects the zeppelin’s evil ways by frying it with sunshine and bringing it to the ground.
* Imagine the sun being so absolutely consumed with rage that it catches a zeppelin on fire and crashes it. Feel the heat from the grounded zeppelin as it smolders.
