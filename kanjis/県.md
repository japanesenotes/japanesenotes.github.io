## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> eye</span> of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> small</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> lion</span> gazes upon the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prefecture</span> that will one day become his. He’s a small lion prince, but once he grows up, everything reflected in his eye will be his prefecture to rule over.
* You remember the old classic movie about the white lion and his prefecture. No? Oh, you're thinking of that big studio knock off. That's okay, whatever makes you remember the laws of prefectural rule.
* This small lion's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prefecture</span> is being protected by <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ken</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けん](https://jisho.org/search/けん)</span>) the samurai because the lion is too small to protect all of this land himself. Ken the samurai is used to wandering far and wide, so one, eye-sized prefecture is nothing to him.
* Picture Ken protecting the prefecture, punching hyenas in the face, and yelling, This may just be a prefecture, not a country, but I'll give it my all for my lion king!
