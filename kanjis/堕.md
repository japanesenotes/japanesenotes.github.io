You had to watch him waste away the same way of a degenerative disease. Why do people have to die, dad?
* This may not be a happy thing to think about, but it will help you remember this kanji better. Imagine your dad fighting a degenerative disease. Imagine helping him fight through this. Everything will be okay eventually. I promise.
