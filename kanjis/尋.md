## Mnemonics
 * <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> Wolverine</span> is doing a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> construction</span> job and he’s using his <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> measure</span> so he knows how many folks he needs to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inquire</span> about helping him with the job. Using one’s mouth is a strange way to measure something, but that’s just how Wolverine does things. Once he measures it all out, he’ll know how many construction workers he needs to inquire about working for him.
* Imagine Wolverine going around, measuring the construction site with his mouth. Look at him with his mouth wide open, wandering around the site deep in thought. What a weirdo.
* You decide to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inquire</span> as to why Wolverine is using his mouth to measure out this construction site. As you get closer you notice his cool ripped <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> jean</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [じん](https://jisho.org/search/じん)</span>). Instead you inquire how he got such a fresh style. He looks you up and down, pulls out his claws, and tears yours up to match his. You’ve completely forgotten what it was you were asking, but who cares! Look how great you look!
* Look down at your ripped up jeans. You’re so fashionable now! Just like good old ‘90s Wolvie.
