## Mnemonics
 * You have <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fingers</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> thousand</span>s and while looking up at the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> you decide you want to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> insert</span> them in there.
* Hold your thousand+ fingers up to the sun and imagine inserting them into the sun's super-hot ... s-sun lava. (That's what it is, right? Yeah, let's go with that.)
* You <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> insert</span> one finger, it burns up immediately, and its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sou</span>l (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そう](https://jisho.org/search/そう)</span>) comes flying out screaming for a moment before it disappears. Hmm. You insert another finger and as it burns up, another little soul comes out screeching, WHY WOULD YOU INSERT ME IN THERE! and is gone.
* Since you have a thousand fingers too many, you decide to insert them all into the sun and watch as their souls pop out. You listen to the little souls scream at you.
