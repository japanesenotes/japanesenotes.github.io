## Mnemonics
 * Under the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> lies a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> turkey</span> with a broken <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> arrow</span> in it. It doesn't have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rights</span> like humans, so people can just shoot turkeys with arrows and no one is punished.
* Imagine if humans didn't have any rights, like this turkey. People could just gun each other down in the street and no one would be punished for it... oh wait. :/
* You have <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rights</span>, so I won't shoot you like this turkey, says the voice of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ken</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けん](https://jisho.org/search/けん)</span>) the samurai, from above you in the tree.
* He jumps down and picks the turkey up, the broken arrow sticking out of its neck. Turkeys do not have rights, my friend. Just let this one go.
