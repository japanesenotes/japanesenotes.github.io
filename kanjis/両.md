## Mnemonics
 * Under the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span>, which you dug into, you found two great finds. You found <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> both</span> a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mountain</span> and a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> head</span>, two strange things to find underground.
* You'll want to focus on the part where you find <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> both</span>, not so much the things themselves. Think about how you can't believe you did so well finding both things at once. Usually you only find one or the other when you're searching.
* But, you dig too deep and water flows into where you are. Your only hope is a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> row</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [りょう](https://jisho.org/search/りょう)</span>) boat floating off in the distance.
* Also think... What's that row boat doing here? But, it's your only hope, so you have to focus on it really hard.
