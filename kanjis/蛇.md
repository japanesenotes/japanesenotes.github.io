## Mnemonics
 * There is an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> insect</span> on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> spoon</span>. It's there for the eating, and it's how you plan to attract a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> snake</span> to your roof.
* Snakes love insects, especially when they're ready to eat on a spoon. But, snakes don't usually go on top of the roof, so that's why you have to tempt one with an insect in a spoon.
* Why don't you just bring a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> snake</span> up to the roof yourself? Because snakes are <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> heavy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [へび](https://jisho.org/search/へび)</span>).
* Especially big snakes. They're really, really hebi.
