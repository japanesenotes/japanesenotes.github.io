## Mnemonics
 * If you think a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tree</span> looks <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sweet</span> you have to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> certain</span> before you bite into it. Trees are really hard, and usually pretty bitter (believe me) so if you don't want a mouthful of broken teeth, sap, and sadness, you really need to be sure it's the one before you start munching.
* Which tree do you think is sweet? That one? Or that one? Are you absolutely certain? I hope you are!
* If you really want to be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> certain</span>, and not just guess, take out your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> bow</span>ling (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぼう](https://jisho.org/search/ぼう)</span>) ball and roll it as hard as you can into the tree. If its the right one it will let out a sweet smell, if it's not the tree will punch you.
* So now let me ask you again, are you certain, or would you like to try the bowling ball test?
