## Mnemonics
 * You can only manage to avoid a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> by standing <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> above</span> it on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> small</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stool</span> if you are very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> graceful</span>. If you aren't graceful enough the tsunami will knock you and the stool over and you'll be swept away like everyone else.
* Imagine being graceful enough to balance on a small stool above a raging tsunami! Sooo cool!
* No matter how <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> graceful</span> you are, the still tsunami <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> shook</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しゅく](https://jisho.org/search/しゅく)</span>) the small stool. That's where your gracefulness came in. The stool shook, but you didn't. You balanced yourself and refused to go down. 
* It doesn't matter how badly the stool shook, you stayed graceful and didn't fall!
