## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> skewer</span> radical and the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> skewer</span> kanji are exactly the same!
* Know your radicals, yo.
* Uh oh, this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> skewer</span> is really... <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cushy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [くし](https://jisho.org/search/くし)</span>). It's so soft and cushy you can't get any meat or vegetables onto it.
* Imagine trying to use this cushy skewer. It's the right shape (long, thin, pointy at one end), but every time you try to put something on it it squishes in on itself like a long marshmallow.
