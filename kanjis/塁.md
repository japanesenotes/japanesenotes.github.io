## Mnemonics
 * There's an <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> explosion</span> in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> dirt</span> under a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span>, exposing the hidden <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> base</span> under there. A base from baseball! I guess this rice paddy was built on top of an old baseball field...
* Picture a serene rice paddy. Now watch the whole thing explode, rice and dirt going everywhere, and a secret, underground baseball base is left there, smoldering.
* Unfortunately, thanks to the explosion, the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> base</span> is in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rui</span>ns (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [るい](https://jisho.org/search/るい)</span>). It's dark and smokey and kinda half burned. You probably can't get this in a regulation game.
* Hold this ruined base in your hands. Darn, you love baseball. At least it's a collectible.
