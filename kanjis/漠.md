## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tsunami</span> hits the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> greenhouse</span>, destroying the last remaining plant life in the area. The tsunami recedes, and there is nothing but sand, and the lands become a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> desert</span>.
* The greenhouse was your only hope in turning the desert into a green forest. Now it's all washed away by salt water, meaning nothing will grow anyways. Feel disappointed about this.
* See the sun come up over the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> desert</span>, then go <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> back</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ばく](https://jisho.org/search/ばく)</span>) down. Up, back down, back up, back down. You stand here for days watching because you're so depressed. Stop being so <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> vague</span> in your approach, sun! You’re weirding everyone out!
* Up, back down, back up, back down. Move your head up and down to keep up with the sun’s movements. Will it ever rise like normal?
