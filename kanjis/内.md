## Mnemonics
 * There's a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> person</span> <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inside</span> your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> head</span>.
* And, you have no idea how to get them out. They're <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inside</span> for good, and it's freaking you out. As in, there's a little person in there, running around, controlling your brain. People think you're crazy, but you know better... He's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> inside</span> there, doing evil things.
* You know this kanji means inside, so you can keep thinking about the person that’s inside you, running around. You finally discover him, and try to take him out, but before you can, he pulls out a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> kni</span>fe (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ない](https://jisho.org/search/ない)</span>) and threatens to cut you if you do anything irrational.
* Imagine him holding the knife out, threatening to stab your brain. You’re in a conundrum here. If you don’t take him out, you’re in trouble, but if you do try to take him out, he might stab you in the brain with his knife. Try to think a way around this situation, focusing mainly on his knife.
