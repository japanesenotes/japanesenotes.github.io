 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> is being blocked by a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rain</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cloud</span>, making it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> cloudy</span>.
* You look up at the sky, trying to find the sun, but it's so cloudy that you can't even find where the sun should be.
* Remember <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [雲](https://jisho.org/search/雲)</span>? It means cloud and has the same reading as cloudy, making them both <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> くも</span>.
* If it's cloudy there are clouds, so if you can read one, you can read the other!
