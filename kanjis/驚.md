## Mnemonics
 * If you can write an interesting <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> poem</span> about <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> winter</span> while riding on a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> horse</span>, I’ll be pretty <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> surprised</span>. It’s hard enough to write a poem as it is, let alone an interesting one. And then you’re riding on a horse and the poem has to be about winter? Heck, I’d be surprised if you didn’t fall off the horse and injure yourself.
* Imagine trying to write a poem while riding a horse. It’d be really hard to do. I bet you’d be surprised if you managed to do it as well.
* You might also be <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> surprised</span> to learn that you are to ride this horse all across <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> きょうと</span>. That gives you a time limit. You have until you traverse <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょうと](https://jisho.org/search/きょうと)</span> to write this poem about winter.
* Imagine riding through <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょうと](https://jisho.org/search/きょうと)</span> on a horse. As if that wasn’t difficult enough for poem writing, now you have all the sights and sounds of <span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [きょうと](https://jisho.org/search/きょうと)</span> to distract you as well.
