## Mnemonics
 * You have to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sickle</span> the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> rice paddy</span> today because it's your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> turn</span>. This kanji also means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> number in a series</span>, which is a lot like a turn. For example, you're number 3, so your turn will be number 3.
* Go through in your mind the system your farm / village uses for deciding who has to sickle on any given day. It rotates, and it's a turn-based system. So, do you all stand in a line? Is there a calendar? Come up with something interesting, focusing on your turn in the process you come up with. <br /> It will be helpful to remember both the number in a series and turn meanings for the vocab coming up in the future.
* This <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> turn</span>-based rice sickle system is a contest as well! But, you are disappointed to find out that you have been <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ban</span>ned from the game because of the performance enhancing steroids you've been taking.
* Try to feel disappointed by this. Strange thing to feel disappointed by, but you were a great sickler. You were going to win the great prize, too (come up with something huge!), but now you're banned for the season.
