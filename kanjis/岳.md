## Mnemonics
 * An <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> axe</span> is sticking in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> on top of a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mountain</span>. It's sticking into the very <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> peak</span>. Because why would you bother to stick your axe anywhere else on the mountain to prove you climbed it? 
* Picture that axe, jammed into the mountain's <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> peak</span>. The person who did that must have been really cool to get all the way up there.
* You can't help but <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> gawk</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がく](https://jisho.org/search/がく)</span>) at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> peak</span>. Somehow it looks even higher now.
* Go ahead, imagine this peak with an axe in it and actually gawk a bit at how far you have to go to get that high.
