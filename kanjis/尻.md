## Mnemonics
 * You have <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> nine</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> flag</span>s. With these nine flags you take them one by one and put them up your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> butt</span>.
* Imagine taking these nine flags... count 'em... and putting them up your butt. With each one that's up there it gets harder and harder to fit the next one in.
* Now that you have nine flags inside your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> butt</span>, you have to get them out. But, you don't know how to. So you ask <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Siri</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しり](https://jisho.org/search/しり)</span>), how do I get nine flags out of my butt?
* In your head, doing the Siri voice, come up with an answer for your nine flags in the butt predicament.
