## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> womb</span> spins in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> circle</span> and starts to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> boil</span> with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> heat</span>. Uh oh, I think you have a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fever</span>.
* Even if you don't have a womb, just picture one anyway: it's turning around in a circle faster and faster, as the heat bubbles and boils in you. You can feel this heat spread through your entire body as you burn up with a fever.
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> heat</span> from your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> fever</span> is making your insides and your head and your entire body spin and boil, until your doctor throws some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> nets</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ねつ](https://jisho.org/search/ねつ)</span>) around you. You were flailing around and they couldn't get you to stop, so they had to catch you in a series of nets.
* These nets aren't making the fever heat go away, but they have made the spinning stop at least.
