## Mnemonics
 * You see a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> soul</span> floating around a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> tombstone</span> acting <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suspicious</span>. To be fair, if a soul is going to be anywhere, a tombstone is probably high up on the list, but this one seems like it's doing something weird.
* Imagine inching closer to this suspicious soul floating around a tombstone. What do you think it's doing?
* You sneak around the tombstone to see what this <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suspicious</span> soul is doing, and you realize it's pretending to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ka</span>yak (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [かい](https://jisho.org/search/かい)</span>). The soul is sitting behind the tombstone, in a small kayak, moving its arms like it's rowing through water.<br />Even more suspicious, the soul seems to be wearing a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> ke</span>vlar (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [け](https://jisho.org/search/け)</span>) vest. Considering the soul is already dead, this doesn't seem like something it will need.
* Picture a suspicious, kevlar wearing, kayaking soul. The afterlife may be more interesting than you thought.
