## Mnemonics
 * Under the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mountain</span>'s <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> roof</span> are people using <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> jackhammer</span>s to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> worship</span> the gods. The noise from their jackhammering echos up through the mountain and up toward the sky where the gods live. As long as each person uses their own jackhammer, the sound will be loud enough to reach them.
* Man your own jackhammer! (And worship the gods.)
* Unfortunately, the people who live around here can also hear you and the others <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> worship</span> in the mountain and they're going to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sue</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [すう](https://jisho.org/search/すう)</span>) you for the noise. 
* You try to argue that you can't sue someone for the way they choose to worship, but they say they're all deaf now, all the animals have gone, and no one sleeps anymore because of the shaking. Yikes, they might have a case!
