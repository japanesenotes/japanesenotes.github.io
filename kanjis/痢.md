## Mnemonics
 * You ate some <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> grain</span>s that made you so <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sick</span> it feels like a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span> is stabbing in your guts and all your poop is falling out. This is called <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> diarrhea</span>. Everyone's had diarrhea before, so you should know this feeling by now.
* Imagine back to the last time you ate something bad and it gave you diarrhea. It felt like someone was sticking you with a knife, didn't it?
* The <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> diarrhea</span> is here. It's happening. And it smells so awful you can't breathe. You have to take some hollow <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> reed</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [り](https://jisho.org/search/り)</span>) and shove them up your nose and out the bathroom door so you can get some fresh air in you.
* You learned this reed technique from a group of ninjas who use them to breathe underwater, and you never thought you'd use them like this.
