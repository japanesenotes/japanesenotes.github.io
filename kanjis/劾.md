## Mnemonics
 * If you want to <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> slice</span> the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> power</span> out of someone just <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> censure</span> them. Then they'll be cut down in front of everyone and they'll feel super embarrassed. It's the best way to slice them down without actually cutting them and getting arrested.
* Picture yourself as you slice the power out of that senator you hate by censuring them in front of the world!
* Once you <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> censure</span> them and they lose all their power, they'll be just another <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> guy</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [がい](https://jisho.org/search/がい)</span>). A normal guy with everything lost to him. HAHAHA!
* Look at that guy now. What a loser.
