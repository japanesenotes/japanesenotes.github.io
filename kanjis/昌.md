## Mnemonics
 * The <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span> is the reason why crops grow and people can get out of bed in the morning. But on planets with two <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> sun</span>s, they can get even more done and it makes them way more <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prosperous</span> than us. They work all day, then as the first sun sets, the second one rises and they get a new burst of energy. The whole planet lives in a state of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> prosperity</span> because of the two suns.
* Picture the prosperous planet that has two suns. They get so much work done that no one is ever hungry or tired or without.
* The person on this planet with two suns who benefits from the prosperity the most is the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>). Yes, this planet still has a shougun as their leader, but everything is going so well that they didn't see a need to change. The shogun will be in charge of this prosperous world forever. No one ever thinks of revolt when everyone has everything they could ever need.
* Picture the Shougun looking over the prosperous world, the two suns at his back.
