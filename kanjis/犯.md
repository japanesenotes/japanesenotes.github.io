## Mnemonics
 * In the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> animal</span> kingdom, a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> snake</span> is the most likely to commit a <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crime</span>. Remember the Garden of Eden? The snake was the bad guy. Ever since then, snakes are the animal most known for committing crimes.
* Picture a snake as a hardened criminal. See this snake with many prison tattoos and muscles from working out in his jail cell. Hear the snake hissing as it slithers about to commit yet another crime.
* This snake has evaded the law for too long. It’s time for a true hero to put an end to its <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> crime</span> spree. Enter <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Han</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [はん](https://jisho.org/search/はん)</span>) Solo. Han Solo is the only man strong and brave enough to put an end to this snake and his crime filled ways.
* Now see Han Solo doing battle with the snake (cue Star Wars music). The snake hisses and lunges at Han, but Han shoots the snake and it’s incapacitated. Smell the smell of scorched snake flesh in your nose.
