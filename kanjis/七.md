## Mnemonics
 * Lucky for you (as is the case with many of the lower-stroke kanji), this kanji is the same as the radical you've already learned. The radical that makes up this kanji is <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> seven</span> and the kanji (which is exactly the same) is also <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seven</span>. So, if you know the radical, you know the meaning of the kanji as well.
* Make sure you know your radicals well and you'll be A-Okay on this one!
* You know this kanji means <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Seven</span>, so let's use that to remember the reading too. <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Seven</span> is a lucky number, usually, but this time it wasn't so good. <br /><span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Seven</span> percent is all she got on her test after <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> she chea</span>ted (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しち](https://jisho.org/search/しち)</span>) on it.
* How unbelievable is it that someone got <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> seven</span> percent on a test, especially if you try to cheat? Imagine the girl you loathe the most from school, and imagine her cheating on the test (it's important it's a girl, because of the she part in <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> she chea</span>ted (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しち](https://jisho.org/search/しち)</span>). Then, imagine your happiness when she's super upset about getting seven percent on it. Serves her right, obviously.
