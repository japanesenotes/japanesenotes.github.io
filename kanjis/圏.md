## Mnemonics
 * Your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> mouth</span> contains a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> scroll</span>, which you pull out and look at. On the scroll is a map, showing the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> range</span> of the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sphere</span> of your mouth.
* On the map, there is a circle drawn around your mouth showing what range your mouth exists in. Thankfully, your tongue and teeth are within that sphere.
* Looking at the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> range</span> of your mouth on the map, you notice a tiny samurai marked near your molars. It is <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Ken</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [けん](https://jisho.org/search/けん)</span>) the samurai.
* Everything else on the map was accurate, so you take a close look in the mirror, and there he is: a tiny Ken the samurai, protecting the range that is your mouth. He gives you a small nod and goes back to his post.
