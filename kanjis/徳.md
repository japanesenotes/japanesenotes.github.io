## Mnemonics
 * You're <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> loiter</span>ing, staring down at the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> cross</span> that got caught in the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> net</span> of your <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> heart</span>, because it's trying to teach you to act with <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> virtue</span>.
* People who keep the cross in their hearts are supposed to be full of virtue, always doing the right thing, always helping others. But you aren't sure if you want to be virtuous, it's a lot of responsibility. So you look down at this symbolic cross and loiter instead of making a decision.
* As you try to decide if you want to live a life of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> virtue</span> the ghost of <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Toku</span>gawa (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [とく](https://jisho.org/search/とく)</span>) Ieyasu appears before you. He points to your heart and the cross, then points to his own and you see a glowing cross in his own.
* I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure Tokugawa Ieyasu is telling you to choose a life of virtue.
