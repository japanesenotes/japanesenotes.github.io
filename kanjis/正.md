## Mnemonics
 * There is a line on the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> ground</span> so you <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stop</span> and a giant sign pops up that says <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> CORRECT</span>! You obeyed the rules of the road and did the correct thing.
* Imagine walking, staring at the ground until you come across a line that you're supposed to stop at. If you stop, the big correct sign appears, chiming a happy tune.
* You did the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> correct</span> thing, so the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Shou</span>gun (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [しょう](https://jisho.org/search/しょう)</span>) shows up to reward you! He holds out a shiny new <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sa</span>ber (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [せい](https://jisho.org/search/せい)</span>) in his hand, gently taps it onto each of your shoulders, and then hands it to you. It's big, curved and you love it.
* Being correct got the Shougun to notice you AND a new saber. You better make sure to answer this kanji correctly in your reviews too, so you can keep being correct and have more nice things happen.
