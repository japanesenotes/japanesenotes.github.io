## Mnemonics
 * A <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> shellfish</span> with a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> knife</span> makes all the <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rule</span>s. It isn't supposed to be making rules, but it has a knife, so who's going to argue?
* Picture a shellfish wielding a knife and shouting out new rules to all of the nervous people standing around it.
* The first <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> rule</span> the shellfish enacts is that all humans take off their <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> sock</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そく](https://jisho.org/search/そく)</span>) and give them to him. Hmm... is this some kind of nasty shellfish? Who would want socks?
* Once everyone follows the rule, and the shellfish is on top of a pile of socks, he cackles, It's easier to stab your toes with my knife now! Let's get to more rules!
