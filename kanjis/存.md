 * NARWHALs are born as adults, NARWHAL CHILDREN do not EXISTI.<br><br>f a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> narwhal</span> <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> stick</span>s a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> child</span> with its horn then you have to admit that it <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exist</span>s. We know some of you have been doubting narwhals and whether they're real. Well now your kid is a kabob, so do you believe they exist now? I <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> suppose</span> you do.
* Imagine needing this kind of horrible proof to believe something exists. Maybe you should have more faith in what we teach.
* Oh, and the child we had to narwhal stab to prove they <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> exist</span> - that's your <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> son</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [そん](https://jisho.org/search/そん)</span>). Maybe you should have listened and kept your son out of the Narwhal Danger <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> Zone</span> (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [ぞん](https://jisho.org/search/ぞん)</span>) after we warned you about it.
* I suppose you'll never forget that narwhals exist now that your son has one permanently stuck in him.
