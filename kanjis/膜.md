## Mnemonics
 * If you trap the <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> moon</span> in a <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> greenhouse</span> it will grow a creepy <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> membrane</span> around itself. The moon isn't used to the heat it would be exposed to in a greenhouse so that membrane is there to protect it. It's really gross looking though.
* Imagine seeing the moon with a membrane sitting stuffed in a greenhouse. It looks like something out of the Alien movies and you're starting to think putting it in there wasn't a good idea.
* You decide to open the greenhouse to check this moon <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> membrane</span> out but when you open the door the smell of big <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> mac</span>s (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [まく](https://jisho.org/search/まく)</span>) hits you in the face. Eww. Why does this membrane smell like a big mac... or does that mean big macs smell like a festering moon?
* Can you imagine if the moon had a membrane and it smelled like a big mac? How does that even happen? You should probably go ask that food chain what they use for their ingredients.
