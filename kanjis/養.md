## Mnemonics
 * <div><div>You<strong>&nbsp;foster</strong>&nbsp;(promote the growth of) your sheep well when they have food right at their feet.</div></div><div><div><i></i></div></div><br>Sheep <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> fins</span> are <span style="background-color:#ADD8E6"> good</span> for <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foster</span>ing children. The sheep have been genetically combined with fish, so the sheep have fins. These sheep fins are very rich in nutrients and as such are very good for foster children that need to grow up big and strong.
* Imagine eating a fish fin with sheep wool on it. It tastes fishy like the ocean but the wool tastes like clothes. It’s probably the worst thing ever. Imagine eating something like this and taste its flavor on your tongue.
* The best way to <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> foster</span> a better relationship with these foster kids would be to give them some <span style="background-color:#ffcccb"> yo</span>gurt (<span style="background-color:#fed8b1"> [よう](https://jisho.org/search/よう)</span>). Maybe they can dip the sheep fins in the yogurt to help mask the strange taste. Yogurt is also very nutritious, so it’s a good supplement to the foster kids’ diet.
* Remember how bad those sheep fins tasted? Now imagine eating your favorite yogurt flavor instead. You’re a foster child, but you don’t even care about that right now – this yogurt is delicious.
